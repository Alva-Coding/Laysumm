ABSTRACT

TITLE

Development of chronic kidney disease after acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis is common and impairs clinical outcomes☆

PARAGRAPH

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in cirrhosis and is associated with poor prognosis.

In patients who survive after AKI, it is not known whether the acute injury leads to chronic impairment of kidney function (chronic kidney disease [CKD]).

The aim of the study was to determine the frequency of CKD at 3 months after an AKI episode and its effects on patient outcomes.

PARAGRAPH

Patients admitted for complications of cirrhosis during a 6.5-year period were evaluated using the same protocol, with assessment of kidney function at regular intervals during and after hospitalization.

CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73m2 at 3 months after AKI.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 409 patients (168 with AKI and 241 without AKI) were included.

After 3 months, 97 patients with AKI and 188 patients without AKI had survived.

Of the 97 patients with AKI, 24 had developed CKD at 3 months compared to only 2 of the 188 patients without AKI (25% vs. 1%, odds ratio 31; p <0.0001).

Risk factors independently associated with CKD were nosocomial AKI and severity of AKI (stage ≥1B).

At diagnosis of CKD, all patients had stage 3A CKD and one-quarter of them progressed to stages 3B and 4 after 1 year.

The transition from AKI to CKD was associated with an increased rate of 3-month hospital readmission, increased frequency of AKI, bacterial infections, ascites, and refractory ascites and a trend towards a higher need for liver transplantation.

Transplant-free survival was not impaired.

PARAGRAPH

CKD frequently develops in patients with cirrhosis who survive AKI and has a negative impact on relevant clinical outcomes.

The transition from AKI to CKD is common and should be considered a high-risk condition in patients with cirrhosis.
