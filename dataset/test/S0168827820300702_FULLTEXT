TITLE

NRF2 activates growth factor genes and downstream AKT signaling to induce mouse and human hepatomegaly

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatomegaly, or liver enlargement, is a non-specific pathological reaction triggered by infections, liver cancer, metabolic disturbances, toxicant exposure, as well as alcohol abuse or drug-induced hepatitis.1

Congenital disorders, including hemolytic anemia, polycystic liver disease, sickle cell disease, hereditary fructose intolerance or carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiency can also elicit hepatomegaly.2–6

Hepatomegaly has been frequently observed in patients with type I and type II diabetes with poor glycemic control.7,8

In such cases, hepatomegaly has been attributed to hepatocyte glycogen accumulation driven by insulin-induced hepatic glycogenosis, especially in pediatric patients.8

By contrast, the mechanisms underlying hepatomegaly caused by other etiologies are poorly understood.

Histopathological analysis suggests the involvement of vascular swelling and inflammation, as well as increased accumulation of iron, glycogen, fat or insoluble proteins within hepatocytes.1

Mimicking insulin overdosing, adenovirus-mediated hepatic overexpression of a constitutively active form of AKT, the key effector of insulin signaling,9 resulted in pronounced hepatomegaly accompanied by hypoglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia.10

PARAGRAPH

Autophagy defects can also induce hepatomegaly.

Indeed, both liver-specific Atg5 (Atg5Δhep) and Atg7 (Atg7Δhep) knockout mice exhibit marked liver enlargement.11–16

Autophagy-deficient livers show accumulation of the autophagy substrate and signaling scaffold p62/SQSTM1 (hereafter referred to p62), which sequesters Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) away from the oxidant-responsive transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), resulting in nuclear accumulation and activation of NRF2.13,16,17

Nuclear NRF2 also accumulates in response to oxidative stress and KEAP1 inactivation.18,19

Normally, NRF2 plays a critical role in the induction of genes that code for cytoprotective redox-active proteins and enzymes that detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS) and xenobiotics.18

But NRF2 can also undergo persistent activation in lung, liver and colon cancers due to gain-of-function mutations in the NFE2L2 gene that prevent binding to KEAP1 or loss-of-function mutations in the KEAP1 gene.20–23

In addition to NRF2, several other factors may contribute to hepatomegaly in the autophagy-deficient liver, including YAP,24 mTORC1,11 and FXR.25

Thus, it is not clear whether NRF2 activation alone is sufficient for induction of hepatomegaly in oxidatively stressed or autophagy-deficient livers.

Also, the relationship between the NRF2-induced protective response and hepatomegaly remains unknown.

PARAGRAPH

NRF2-deficient mice are susceptible to numerous electrophiles and oxidants,18,26 and also exhibit defective liver regeneration due to oxidative stress-mediated insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) resistance.27

Conversely, NRF2 activation redirects glucose and glutamine into the anabolic pentose phosphate pathway when superimposed on persistently activated AKT in cancer cells that exhibit chronic upregulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling.28

Although in cancer cells NRF2 activation confers survival and growth advantage,29–32 in autophagy-defective livers NRF2 activation was reported to provoke hepatocyte death and liver injury.12,13,16,25,33

How NRF2 activation promotes liver injury in the absence of autophagy is unknown.

Moreover, persistent activation of NRF2 in an autophagy competent liver does not cause liver injury as shown by liver-specific Keap1 knockout (Keap1Δhep) mice, which exhibit hepatomegaly without liver damage.12

Evidently, the effects of persistent NRF2 activation are highly context dependent.

PARAGRAPH

We previously found that in the unstressed liver, p62 controls basal NRF2 activity32 and that p62 accumulation due to autophagy disruption contributes to liver and pancreatic tumorigenesis by activating NRF2.30,32,34

To further understand the role of persistent NRF2 activation in hepatocytes and whether it is sufficient to induce hepatomegaly, we generated transgenic mice that express a KEAP1-resistant form of NRF2 in their hepatocytes (Nrf2Act-hep).

We also used p62 adenovirus vectors to selectively overexpress p62 in hepatocytes.

Here, we demonstrate that hepatocyte-specific activation of NRF2 by either method causes marked hepatomegaly, glycogenosis, hypoglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia.

Unexpectedly, we found that persistent NRF2 activation leads to hepatomegaly via upregulation of AKT signaling and that the latter depends on autocrine epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling.

The NRF2-AKT axis is also activated in human hepatomegaly.

Materials and methods

SECTION

Mouse experimentation

PARAGRAPH

Nfe2l2iE79Q/+ mice were generated at Genentech using C57BL/6N embryonic stem cells and standard methodology.

A targeting cassette containing the loxP sequence, a duplicated copy of the last 130 bp of Nfe2l2 intron 1, wild-type (WT) Nfe2l2 cDNA (exons 2-5), a human growth hormone 3' UTR followed by a 4× polyadenylation signal, an FRT-Neo-FRT selection marker and a second loxP sequence was inserted into the Nfe2l2 locus 130 bp 5' to a mutated exon 2 encoding the E79Q (GAA to CAA) mutation.

The Neo cassette was excised in embryonic stem cells using FLP recombinase prior to electroporation.

All alleles were maintained on a C57BL/6N genetic background.

Upon Cre action, the floxed cassette is excised leaving a single loxP site, and exon 1 now splices to the modified exon 2 instead of the WT Nfe2l2 cDNA.

Sqstm1/p62F/F, Atg7F/F, RaptorF/F and IkkβF/F mice15,35–37 were intercrossed with Alb-Cre mice (C57BL/6, Jackson Lab) to generate Sqstm1/p62F/F;Alb-Cre (p62Δhep), Atg7F/F-Alb-Cre (Atg7Δhep), RaptorΔhep and IkkβΔhep mice.

B6.129X1-Nfe2l2tm1Ywk/J (Nrf2-/-) mice were previously described38 and back-crossed into the C57BL/6 background.

Atg7Δhep and p62Δhep mice were crossed to generate Atg7Δhep; p62Δhep mice.

All mice were maintained in filter-topped cages on autoclaved food and water and experiments were performed according to UCSD Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and NIH guidelines and regulations.

Dr. Karin's Animal Protocol S00218 was approved by the UCSD Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Human hepatomegaly clinical samples

PARAGRAPH

Data were obtained from liver tissues of 5 male and 5 female patients with HSOS-related hepatomegaly and 4 male and 6 female control livers (patients with hepatic hemangioma), as well as 3 male and 2 female patients with AIH-related hepatomegaly, and 3 male and 2 female control livers (patients with hepatic hemangioma).

Liver tissues were acquired between June 2018 and June 2019 at The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School (Nanjing, Jiangsu, China).

Patients with hepatomegaly ranged from 27 to 54 years old, with a mean age of 40.7 years.

Eight patients with HSOS suffered from ascites and 9 patients suffered from jaundice.

Patients with hepatic hemangioma ranged from 29 to 62 years, with a mean age of 44.6 years.

Control individuals with normal liver histology had normal levels of aminotransferases with no evidence of ascites, jaundice or hepatomegaly.

The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital with IRB #2018-289-01.

Informed consent for tissue analysis was obtained before surgery.

Detailed characteristics of hepatomegaly in patients with HSOS and AIH as well as controls are listed in Tables S1 and S2.

All research was performed in compliance with government policies and the Helsinki declaration.

All experiments were undertaken with the understanding and written consent of each participant.

RNA-seq analysis and data processing

PARAGRAPH

Single end 50 bp reads were obtained by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).

FASTQC module was run on FASTq files to check data quality.

Quality scores for raw reads were Sanger transformed using FASTq Groomer.

FASTq Groomer outputs were aligned to mm10 genome using TopHat (-first strand) in local sensitive model.

Aligned reads were sorted by coordinates using Sort BAM module.

Gene expression estimates were calculated using Cufflinks using reference mm10 GTF file from iGenomes.

Results

SECTION

p62 induces NRF2-dependent hepatomegaly

PARAGRAPH

Overexpression of p62 in mouse liver causes hepatocellular carcinoma.32

To investigate early effects of p62 overexpression that may shed new light on its tumorigenic activity, we used adenovirus (Adv) to transiently express GFP, p62 WT or a p62 variant, p62KIR- (that no longer binds KEAP1), in mouse livers.13

Transduction of p62 WT, but not p62KIR- or GFP, led to pronounced hepatomegaly, resulting in a 2.5-fold increase in liver to body weight ratio within 7 days of Adv infection (Fig.1A,B).

PARAGRAPH

Histological analysis confirmed numerous p62-expressing hepatocytes in both p62 WT- and p62KIR--transduced mice (Fig. 1C).

Even Adv-GFP infection led to a small increase in endogenous p62 expression, which may reflect Adv-induced inflammation and NF-κB activation.39

Transduction of p62 WT, but not p62KIR- Adv, induced the NRF2 target genes NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (Nqo1) and glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 (Gstm1) (Fig. 1D).

To determine whether p62-induced hepatomegaly was NRF2-dependent and to examine the role of endogenous p62, with which exogenous p62 may oligomerize, as well as mTORC1 and IKKβ/NF-κB signaling, which are also stimulated by p62,17 we transduced different mouse mutants with Adv-p62.

Only Nrf2-/- mice were resistant to induction of hepatomegaly, whereas Adv-p62 transduction of p62Δhep, RaptorΔhep and IkkβΔhep mice led to as much hepatomegaly as in WT mice (Fig. S1A).

These results confirm that NRF2, but neither mTORC1 nor NF-κB, is needed for p62-induced hepatomegaly.

PARAGRAPH

To determine whether NRF2 activation is sufficient for induction of hepatomegaly, we used Nfe2l2iE79Q/+ mice that conditionally express an NRF2(E79Q) variant that no longer binds KEAP1 (Fig. S1B), originally identified in lung cancer.20

We intercrossed these mice with Alb-Cre mice to generate homozygous Nrf2Act-hep mice in which NRF2 is activated in liver parenchymal cells (Fig. 1E).

As seen with Adv-p62 overexpression, liver-specific NRF2 activation caused hepatomegaly, which was apparent at 4 weeks of age and maximal at 8 weeks (Fig. 1F), similar to what was seen in the Keap1Δhep mice.12

Histological examination revealed cytoplasmic clearing in 8- and 16-week-old Nrf2Act-hep mice (Fig. S1C), similar to what was observed in human hepatomegaly caused by insulin overdosing.8

Of note, no obvious liver injury was observed in the Nrf2Act-hep mice as evidenced by serum alanine aminotransferase levels (Fig. S1D).

As expected, liver-specific NRF2 activation induced NRF2 target genes and proteins (Fig. S1E,F).

SECTION

NRF2 activation causes liver hypertrophy and G2/M arrest

PARAGRAPH

Tissue enlargement can be due to increased cell number (hyperplasia) or cell size (hypertrophy).

To determine the basis for NRF2-induced hepatomegaly, we measured the number of nuclei per high magnification field (HMF) and determined hepatocyte DNA content.

While p62 WT transduction decreased the number of nuclei per HMF, it increased the amount of DNA per hepatocyte (Fig. 2A,B).

The numbers of Ki67+ hepatocytes were not significantly different between GFP-, p62 WT- and p62KIR--transduced animals (Fig. 2C).

Consistent with increased DNA content per hepatocyte, qPCR analysis revealed increased expression of G2/M checkpoint-related genes, including aurora kinase a (Aurka), forkhead box m1 (Foxm1), cell division cycle 25c (Cdc25c) and cyclin b2 (Ccnb2) in p62 WT-transduced livers (Fig. 2D).

Increased expression of the G2/M marker transcripts Aurka, Foxm1, Ccnb2, Cdc25c and Cdc25b was also seen in Nrf2Act-hep mice (Fig. 2E).

Consistent with these results, hepatocyte-specific NRF2 activation decreased the number of nuclei per HMF, but had no significant effect on hepatocyte DNA content (Fig. S2A) or the number of Ki67+ hepatocytes (Fig. S2B).

Because p21 plays an important role in regulating hepatocyte proliferation in vivo and can prevent cell cycle progression upon activation of organ size homeostatic mechanisms,40 we examined Cdkn1a/p21 expression.

NRF2 activation induced Cdkn1a/p21 mRNA and protein in mouse liver (Fig. S2C,D).

In agreement with a previous finding in pancreatic cancer,30 Mdm2 mRNA and protein were upregulated, resulting in lower p53 protein amounts (Fig. S2C,D).

These observations suggest a p53-independent mechanism of Cdkn1a/p21 modulation.

PARAGRAPH

To better understand p62-induced changes in the hepatocyte transcriptome, we performed transcriptomic profiling by RNA-seq on total liver RNA extracted from GFP-, p62 WT- and p62KIR--transduced mice.

GSEA revealed that Adv-p62 WT strongly induced gene signatures corresponding to the ROS pathway, G2M checkpoint, fatty acid metabolism and xenobiotic metabolism (Fig. 2F and Fig. S2E).

In agreement with our hypothesis that NRF2 is the key downstream target for p62, GSEA of RNA-seq data from Nrf2Act-hep and WT mouse livers showed upregulation of many of the gene sets found to be upregulated in response to p62 overexpression (Fig. 2G and Fig. S2F).

In particular, hepatocyte-specific NRF2 activation upregulated genes related to protein secretion and the unfolded protein response, which is known to be activated by NRF2 along with the ROS pathway.41

NRF2 activation also led to upregulation of gene sets involved in fatty acid metabolism and xenobiotic metabolism, both of which were activated by p62.

SECTION

NRF2 activation alters glucose and lipid metabolism

PARAGRAPH

Given the phenotypic similarity between p62- or NRF2-induced mouse hepatomegaly and insulin-induced hepatomegaly in humans,8 we investigated whether p62 overexpression and NRF2 activation affect glucose and lipid metabolism.

Strikingly, p62 WT overexpression and hepatocyte-specific NRF2 activation resulted in marked hypoglycemia (Fig. 3A), phenocopying insulin overdosing.

However, circulating insulin in these mice was not elevated and was a bit reduced in mice with liver-specific NRF2 activation (Fig. 3B).

Nonetheless, similar to insulin overdosing, p62 overexpression and hepatocyte-specific NRF2 activation stimulated accumulation of liver glycogen (Fig. 3C and Fig. S3A), and liver and serum triglycerides (Fig. 3D and Fig. S3B), along with elevated serum cholesterol (Fig. S3C).

Furthermore, both hepatic NADPH and the NADPH to NADP ratio was elevated in the livers of p62 overexpression and Nrf2Act-hep mice (Fig. 3E and Fig. S3D).

PARAGRAPH

Consistent with these findings, Adv-p62 induced hepatic expression of genes involved in glycogen, glucose and pentose phosphate metabolism and de novo lipogenesis, including glycogen branching enzyme 1 (GBE1), glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), hexokinase 2 (HK2), glucokinase (GCK), phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT), methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2), transaldolase 1 (TALDO1), transketolase (TKT), malic enzyme (ME1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) and Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) (Fig. 3F).

By contrast, expression of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1) gene was suppressed.

Genes encoding transporters involved in lipid and sterol uptake, such as CD36, ABCG5 and ABCG8, were also induced, but the LDL receptor gene was suppressed (Fig. 3F).

PARAGRAPH

NRF2 activation also induced expression of genes coding for GBE1, G6PD, TKT, ME1, SREPB1c and ACC1 as well as solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11), CD36, ABCG8 and ABCG5 (Fig. S3E).

p62 overexpression also led to induction of the glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) and SLC7A11 (Fig. S3F), both of which maintain redox homeostasis.

SECTION

NRF2-induced hepatomegaly requires AKT activation

PARAGRAPH

Given the similarity between the effects of p62 and NRF2 on liver metabolism and size and those of insulin, we investigated whether p62 and NRF2 affected some aspects of insulin signaling after all.

Remarkably, both p62 and NRF2 strongly induced phosphorylation of AKT, the major insulin signaling effector, at threonine (T) 308 and serine (S) 473, indicative of its activation (Fig. 4A,B).

S241 phosphorylation of PDK1, which mediates AKT T308 phosphorylation,42 was also increased on NRF2 activation and Adv-p62 transduction, which also stimulated p70S6K T389 phosphorylation.

Similarly, p62 and NRF2 modestly stimulated glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3α/β phosphorylation at S21 (GSK3α) and S9 (GSK3β) and forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) phosphorylation at S256.

Curiously, Adv-p62 infection or NRF2 activation downregulated PDGF receptor α (PDGFRα) and EGF receptor (EGFR) expression, although the amounts of the tyrosine phosphorylated receptors barely declined (Fig. 4A-C).

Of note, Adv-p62 infection or NRF2 activation did not stimulate phosphorylation of IRS1 at Y989 or Y1229, or phosphorylation of IGF1Rβ at Y1131 (Fig. 4A,B).

As expected, Adv-p62 WT, but not p62KIR-, induced upregulation of its target NQO1 and the inactivity of p62KIR- was not due to its under-expression (Fig. 4A).

NRF2 activation led to a small decrease in expression of Irs1 mRNA but hardly affected Irs2 and Insr mRNAs (Fig. S4A).

Consistent with its effect on AKT, NRF2 activation attenuated FOXO1 nuclear localization in fasted mice (Fig. S4B).

Even though NRF2 activation enhanced p70S6K T389 phosphorylation, it did not affect ribosomal S6 protein or 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and did not alter Myc or cyclin D1 expression (Fig. S4C), suggesting that NRF2 activation does not modulate these aspects of translational control.

PARAGRAPH

We examined whether AKT activation was responsible for p62-induced hepatomegaly by treating Adv-p62 infected mice with the AKT inhibitor (AKTi) MK2206 (Fig. S4D).

AKTi treatment blocked, as expected, both T308 and S473 phosphorylation (Fig. S4E), and completely prevented p62-induced hepatomegaly (Fig. 4D).

AKTi treatment modestly attenuated the decrease in PDGFRα expression and strongly decreased GSK3α/β phosphorylation, without affecting EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. S4E).

AKTi treatment also blocked the Adv-p62 elicited induction of G2/M marker transcripts (Fig. 4E), reduced the expression of Adv-p62-induced G6pd and Mthfd2 mRNAs and reversed the decrease in Pdk2 and Pck1 mRNAs, without affecting the classic NRF2 target genes Nqo1 and Gclc (Fig. 4F).

Beyond hepatomegaly, AKTi treatment inhibited Adv-p62-induced liver glycogen accumulation (Fig. S4F).

Primary Nrf2Act-hep hepatocytes treated with AKTi showed reduced AKT S473, IRS1 Y1229 and Y989 and p70S6K T389 phosphorylation and less of a decrease in EGFR expression, without an effect on NQO1 and PDK1 expression (Fig. S4G).

AKTi treatment, however, did inhibit induction of the G2/M markers Ccnb2 and Foxm1 mRNAs, as well as G6pd, Gbe1 and Me1 mRNAs in these cells (Fig. S4H).

AKTi treatment also inhibited induction of Me1, Gbe1, Taldo1 and Tkt mRNAs in Adv-p62 infected primary hepatocytes (Fig. S4I).

In conclusion, AKT activation accounts for most, if not all, of the metabolic effects of NRF2 activation, and NRF2-induced AKT activation and hepatomegaly can be separated from the NRF2-activated antioxidant response.

SECTION

NRF2 transcriptionally controls EGFR and PDGFR ligand expression

PARAGRAPH

We used immunohistochemistry to spatially define the effect of p62 overexpression and NRF2 activation on EGFR expression and phosphorylation.

Both Adv-p62 transduction and Nrf2Act-hep activation decreased hepatocyte staining with an antibody to non-phosphorylated EGFR but increased staining with a phospho-EGFR antibody (Fig. 5A and Fig. S5A).

These results suggested that total EGFR downregulation was probably due to its chronic activation, which triggers receptor endocytosis.43,44

Consistent with its effects on receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, p62 WT, but not p62KIR-, increased mRNAs for the EGFR ligands Tgfa and amphiregulin (Areg) and PDGFR ligands Pdgfa, Pdgfb and Pdgfc (Fig. 5B and Fig. S5B).

It also increased expression of mRNAs for the ligand processing enzymes Adam10 and Adam17 (Fig. 5C).

Elevated Tgfa, Areg and Egf mRNA expression was also seen in Nrf2Act-hep livers, while Egfr mRNA amounts were unchanged (Fig. 5D).

Pdgfc mRNA was also elevated in the Nrf2Act-hep livers (Fig. S5C).

Neither p62 overexpression nor NRF2 activation led to induction of Igf1, Igf2, Igf1r or Igf2r mRNAs (Fig. S5D).

PARAGRAPH

To validate that these p62-dependent changes in growth factor receptor protein expression are cell autonomous, we overexpressed p62 WT and p62KIR- in primary mouse hepatocytes in the absence of non-parenchymal cells.

As in intact liver, Adv-p62 induced downregulation of EGFR and PDGFRα and stimulated AKT T308 phosphorylation (Fig. S5E).

Adv-p62 also induced the classic NRF2 target genes Slc7a11, Nqo1 and Gclc as well as the metabolic genes Gbe1, Me1, Taldo1 and Tkt and the growth factors Areg, Tgfa, and Pdgfc, none of which were strongly upregulated in Adv-p62 infected Nrf2-/- hepatocytes (Fig. S5F).

These results confirm that NRF2 is required for induction of all these genes.

PARAGRAPH

Recent studies had suggested possible transcriptional regulation of Pdgfa mRNA by NRF2.45

To determine whether other Pdgf and Egf family member genes are directly activated by NRF2, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments on primary hepatocytes from Nrf2Act-hep mice, as well as hepatocytes transduced with Adv-GFP or Adv-p62.

These experiments confirmed recruitment of NRF2 to the Tgfa and Areg gene promoters as well as to the Pdgfc and Nqo1 promoters (Fig. 5E,F).

Primary hepatocytes isolated from Nrf2-/- mice, used as controls, did not show any significant signal above the non-specific antibody control.

PARAGRAPH

To validate NRF2-mediated growth factor induction, we collected conditioned medium (CM) from Adv-GFP and Adv-p62 infected primary hepatocytes and added it to non-infected hepatocytes.

As early as 15 min after its addition, CM from Adv-p62-transduced hepatocytes induced phosphorylation of EGFR, PDGFRα and AKT (Fig. 6A).

CM from primary Nrf2Act-hep hepatocytes, but not primary WT hepatocyte CM, also induced AKT phosphorylation and EGFR downregulation 24 h after its addition (Fig. S6A).

Growth factor-mediated receptor phosphorylation and activation are accompanied by endocytic trafficking.

CM from Adv-p62-transduced hepatocytes induced EGFR internalization at 15 min after its addition (Fig. 6B).

To confirm that growth factors present in the CM activate EGFR and PDGFR, mouse primary hepatocytes were treated with recombinant EGF and PDGFAA.

At 15 min, EGF and PDGFAA induced EGFR and PDGFR phosphorylation as well as AKT phosphorylation and EGFR downregulation (Fig. 6C).

These effects were blocked by the specific EGFR inhibitor erlotinib and the PDGFR inhibitor CP-673451.

Erlotinib and CP-673451 also blocked AKT and EGFR phosphorylation in response to Adv-p62 CM (Fig. 6D).

Consistent with these in vitro findings, treatment of Adv-p62-transduced mice with the broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib, the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib and the PDGFR inhibitor CP-673451 alone or in combination reduced the extent of hepatomegaly (Fig. S6B,C), and they consistently inhibited phosphorylation of AKT as well as EGFR and PDGFR downregulation (Fig. S6D).

Combined treatment with erlotinib and CP-673451 also inhibited Adv-p62-induced upregulation of Me1, Gbe1 and Taldo1 mRNAs (Fig. 6E) as well as liver glycogen accumulation (Fig. S6E).

The residual degree of liver PAS staining in erlotinib + CP-673451 treated mice was similar to that seen after transduction of Nrf2-/- mice with Adv-p62.

Erlotinib treatment of primary Nrf2Act-hep hepatocytes inhibited induction of Ccnb2 and Foxm1 as well as G6pd, Gbe1, Me1 and Fasn mRNAs (Fig. S6F).

Autophagy disruption causes NRF2-mediated growth factor expression and AKT activation

PARAGRAPH

Liver-specific ATG7 ablation causes hepatomegaly through p62-mediated NRF2 activation.12–15

NRF2 activation in autophagy-deficient livers is prevented by p62 deletion.14

To determine whether NRF2 activation also mediates growth factor expression and AKT activation in the autophagy-deficient liver, we used the Alb-Cre driver to generate Atg7Δhep and Atg7Δhep; p62Δhep mice.

Consistent with results obtained from Mx-1-Cre mediated Atg7 ablation and whole body p62 knockout (p62-/-) mice,14 parenchymal cell-specific p62 ablation completely prevented hepatomegaly caused by Atg7 ablation (Fig. 7A).

Like other drivers of NRF2 activation, Atg7 ablation led to AKT T308, PDK1 S241 and FOXO1 S256 phosphorylation, and EGFR downregulation, along with strong p62 accumulation and NQO1 expression (Fig. 7B).

All of these effects were reversed upon p62 ablation.

Like p62 overexpressing mice, Atg7Δhep mice displayed elevated liver expression of Tgfa, Areg, Pdgfb and Pdgfc mRNAs, all of which were reduced upon parenchymal cell-specific p62 ablation (Fig. 7C).

Liver-specific Atg7 ablation also resulted in upregulation of Slc7a11, Cd36, Ccnb2, G6pd, Aurka, Mthfd2, Nqo1, Tkt, Taldo1, and HK2 transcripts, all of which were diminished after p62 ablation (Fig. S7A).

As seen in Adv-p62-transduced livers, Atg7 ablation increased liver Adam10 and Adam17 mRNAs and this was also reduced by p62 ablation (Fig. S7B).

Atg7 deletion increased liver TG accumulation and this was reversed by p62 ablation (Fig. S7C).

SECTION

Human hepatomegaly specimens show NRF2 and EGFR activation

PARAGRAPH

To determine whether some types of human hepatomegaly are associated with NRF2 activation and EGFR engagement, we analyzed liver specimens collected from patients with pyrrolizidine alkaloid-induced HSOS.

HSOS is a potentially life-threatening hepatic vascular disease associated with abdominal distension, pain in the hepatic region, ascites, jaundice and hepatomegaly.

Compared with normal livers, livers from patients with HSOS and AIH showed increased expression of p62 and the NRF2 target NQO1 (Fig. 8 and Fig. S8).

In addition, livers from patients with HSOS and AIH showed downregulation of non-phosphorylated EGFR and upregulation of Tyr1068 phosphorylated EGFR and Ser473 phosphorylated AKT, as well as glycogen accumulation.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Hepatomegaly can be triggered by insulin overdosing and many other etiologies that cause dysregulated glycogen or lipid accumulation in hepatocytes.8

Other than insulin overdosing, the mechanisms underlying hepatomegaly were unknown, although hepatomegaly in the autophagy-deficient liver was attributed to NRF2 activation.12,13

Originally recognized as the master activator of the anti-oxidant response,19 NRF2 is also an important metabolic regulator that redirects glucose and glutamine into the anabolic pentose phosphate pathway in cancer cells with constitutive PI3K-AKT signaling.28

This function of NRF2, however, was suggested to take place only in proliferative cell types, and not in adult liver, whose cells do not proliferate.

Here we show that in addition to being responsive to AKT signaling,28 NRF2 itself is a potent, but indirect, activator of AKT in non-transformed and non-proliferative hepatocytes that are subjected to either mutational NRF2 activation, p62 overexpression, or disruption of autophagy.

Importantly, our results reveal a missing link between NRF2 activation and hepatomegaly, that depends on AKT activation.

AKT activation may also underlie other forms of hepatomegaly.

Quite surprisingly, we found that the effects of NRF2 on hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism are all depedent on AKT activation.

Mechanistically, we show that in non-transformed and non-proliferative hepatocytes, NRF2 directly activates transcription of growth factor genes encoding the PDGFR ligand Pdgfc and the EGFR ligands Tgfa and Areg, which contribute to AKT activation via autocrine signaling.

These findings suggest that any condition that leads to hepatic NRF2 activation, including autophagy disruption and oxidative stress, as well as chronic insulin or growth factor receptor activation, can culminate in hepatomegaly, a common pathology that, at least in mice, is fully reversed on AKT or EGFR + PDGFR inhibition.

Through the use of such inhibitors, we separated the metabolic effects of NRF2 from its cytoprotective antioxidant response, which is growth factor and AKT independent.

PARAGRAPH

Although a recent study carried out in oxidatively stressed Kras-transformed pancreatic cancer cells that were completely depleted of NRF2, suggested a link between NRF2 and EGFR signaling, this link was attributed to indirect redox regulation of ADAM10, as well as redox control of cap-dependent translation.31

However, it should be emphasized that other than deliberate Nfe2l2 gene disruption, a complete NRF2 deficiency does not occur in cancer cells, many of which show elevated NRF2 expression and activity.23

Additionally, a proteomic screen for NRF2-dependent drug targets in lung cancer cells did not substantiate a link between NRF2 and the translational machinery.46

Of further note, in whole body Nfe2l2-/- mice, liver and pancreatic development are totally normal as long as the mice are not subjected to extreme oxidative stress.26

Thus, a complete NRF2 deficiency does not impact EGFR signaling, which is needed for proper liver development.47

Although we investigated the function of NRF2 in non-transformed liver parenchymal cells, the results thus obtained may also be relevant to cancers in which NRF2 is mutationally activated.

Genetic studies of autophagy-deficient mice suggested a key role for the p62-KEAP1-NRF2 axis in driving both hepatomegaly and liver injury.13–15

Interestingly, NRF2 activation rather than p62 accumulation seems to be the dominant cause of hepatomegaly and tissue injury in the autophagy impaired liver, as NRF2 deletion completely rescued liver damage and hepatomegaly in Atg7Δhep; Keap1Δhep mice.12

Consistent with previous results obtained in Atg7F/F; Mx-1-Cre and Atg7F/F; Mx-1-Cre; p62-/- mice,13 our liver-specific p62 deletion also rescued hepatomegaly in Atg7Δhep mice.

However, in contrast to previous reports,12,13,25,33 we found that persistent NRF2 activation in Nrf2Act-hep mice caused hepatomegaly without any sign of liver injury.

Likewise, adenovirus-mediated p62 overexpression led to hepatomegaly, but did not induce liver damage, although ectopic expression of p62 in growing cell lines was reported to cause cytotoxicity due to inhibition of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis.48

In respect to hepatomegaly and liver injury, the liver phenotype of the Nrf2Act-hep mouse is very similar to that of the Keap1Δhep mouse.13,49

Curiously, a different mouse line with liver constitutively active NRF2, in which the 88 N-terminal residues including the KEAP1 binding site were deleted, did not show any hepatomegaly.50

The discrepancy between the 2 mouse strains is likely due to differences in NRF2 expression levels, as the previous study used NRF2 heterozygotes, whereas our study was conducted in homozygote mutant mice.

In addition, hepatomegaly in Nrf2Act-hep mice is not as severe as in Atg7Δhep mice.

Unlike the Atg7Δhep mice, in which the liver continued to grow for many months, hepatomegaly in Nrf2Act-hep mice peaked at 8 weeks of age.

Furthermore, the milder hepatomegaly in Nrf2Act-hep mice did not disrupt the normal liver structure and did not cause narrowing of sinusoidal capillaries or abnormal morphology of bile canaliculi, all of which can cause liver injury.

PARAGRAPH

Through its ability to activate AKT downstream of EGFR and PDGFR, NRF2 leads to induction of a large battery of anabolic genes that convert glucose to glycogen and glucose-derived acetyl-CoA to fatty acids, resulting in decreased blood glucose and increased liver glycogen and triglycerides.

Our findings of increased triglyceride accumulation in 8 month-old Atg7Δhep mice differ from a recent report that 5 week-old mouse hepatocytes lacking ATG7 show decreased lipid droplet biosynthesis.51

The main difference between this prior study and ours is the age of the mice.

In addition, our results are consistent with a previous report based on analysis of 4 month-old Atg7Δhep mice.52

Consistent with its ability to prevent NRF2 activation, p62 deletion abolished triglyceride accumulation in Atg7Δhep mice.

Although the liver hardly contains any proliferative cells, AKT activation also causes upregulation of p21 and G2/M markers, suggesting that it favors an increase in cell size (hypertrophy) over cell number (hyperplasia).

Examination of human clinical specimens confirms p62 accumulation, NRF2 activation and elevated EGFR and AKT phosphorylation in at least one form of human hepatomegaly caused by toxicant exposure – pyrrolizidine alkaloid-induced HSOS.53

Pyrrolizidine alkaloids undergo metabolic activation in hepatocytes to form highly reactive metabolites that generate pyrrole-protein adducts.54

This reaction may interfere with the autophagic degradation of p62 and lead to KEAP1 inactivation, thereby causing strong NRF2 activation, which eventually culminates in AKT-driven hepatomegaly.
