TITLE

Real-world effectiveness and safety of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for the treatment of patients with chronic HCV infection: A meta-analysis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is a pangenotypic, direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drug regimen, given as a once-daily, all-oral, interferon (IFN)-free, ribavirin (RBV)-free, fixed-dose combination.

It was approved for the treatment of patients with chronic HCV genotypes (GT) 1–6 infection in the European Union in July 2017,1 in the United States in August 2017,2 and in Japan in September 2017.3

The duration of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir therapy depends on prior HCV treatment, cirrhosis status, and HCV GT.1,2

In HCV treatment-naïve patients, treatment for 8 weeks is recommended for patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis for all GTs.1,2

In HCV treatment-experienced patients (who failed prior treatment with pegylated IFNα + RBV ± sofosbuvir, or sofosbuvir + RBV) with GT1, 2, 4–6 infection, treatment for 8 weeks is recommended for those without cirrhosis, while 12 weeks is recommended for those with compensated cirrhosis.1,2

In HCV treatment-experienced patients with GT3 infection, treatment for 16 weeks is recommended, irrespective of cirrhosis status,1,2 although European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines recommend treatment for 12 weeks in treatment-experienced, non-cirrhotic, GT3-infected patients.4

In the United States, treatment for 16 weeks is also recommended for patients with GT1 infection who were previously treated with an NS5A inhibitor (but not an NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and 12 weeks in patients previously treated with an NS3/4A protease (but not an NS5A inhibitor), irrespective of cirrhosis status.2

In Japan, DAA-naïve, non-cirrhotic patients with HCV GT1 or 2 infection are treated for 8 weeks with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir.

Patients with HCV GT3–6 infection, those with compensated cirrhosis, and DAA-experienced patients are treated for 12 weeks.3

PARAGRAPH

In phase II and III multinational clinical studies, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir treatment resulted in high rates of sustained virologic response at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12) and a favorable safety profile in a broad range of patients with chronic HCV infection.1,2

In the overall intention-to-treat (ITT) population, SVR12 was achieved in 97.5% of patients with chronic HCV infection who were treated for the recommended duration, irrespective of prior HCV treatment experience or the presence of cirrhosis.1

Data from clinical trials and additional subgroup analyses have also shown that glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is efficacious in some ITT patient populations historically considered more challenging to treat, including patients aged ≥65 years (SVR12: 97.9%),5 those with recent or former drug use (SVR12: 96.3%),6 those receiving opioid substitution therapy (OST; SVR12: 96.2%),7 patients with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) including those requiring dialysis (SVR12: 98.4%),8 liver or kidney transplant recipients (≥3 months post-transplant; SVR12: 98.0%),9 and patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (SVR12: 98.0%).10

PARAGRAPH

In routine clinical practice, DAA effectiveness may be lower than that seen in clinical trials because patient populations tend to be more diverse and potentially less adherent to treatment.11,12

For many DAA regimens, a similar efficacy in real-world settings to that observed in clinical trials has already been confirmed.13,14

However, as glecaprevir/pibrentasvir was approved for the treatment of patients with chronic HCV in the latter part of 2017, published data regarding its use in clinical practice are currently limited to a small number of real-world cohorts.15,16

Furthermore, analyses of distinct settings and a broader analysis combining different settings and countries are currently lacking.

To address this, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of available real-world data reporting the effectiveness and/or safety of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for the treatment of adults with chronic HCV infection.

SECTION

Materials and methods

SECTION

Systematic review and screening

PARAGRAPH

A literature search was undertaken to identify any real-world studies published in English from January 1, 2017, to February 25, 2019, using the search terms: (hepatitis C OR hepacivirus OR HCV) AND ([glecaprevir AND pibrentasvir]) OR Maviret OR Mavyret) AND (real world).

The following databases were searched: BIOSIS (EBSCO, Ipswich, MA), Derwent Drug File (Ovid, New York, NY), Embase® (Elsevier, Amsterdam, Netherlands), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (EBSCO, Ipswich, MA), MEDLINE® (National Network of Libraries of Medicine, Bethesda, MD), and SciSearch (Clarivate Analytics, London, UK).

Embase was also used to search local/regional and international conference abstracts, posters, and oral presentations using the same search terms.

In addition, conference-specific websites were queried up to April 14, 2019.

PARAGRAPH

Abstracts and their titles were manually screened to identify eligible prospective or retrospective real-world cohort studies (comparative and non-comparative) in which glecaprevir/pibrentasvir was used to treat chronic HCV infection in adults (≥20 patients) and in which SVR12 and/or safety parameters were reported.

Clinical trials, case reports, and studies that did not distinguish glecaprevir/pibrentasvir-treated patients from other patients were excluded.

SECTION

Efficacy

PARAGRAPH

Efficacy outcomes were the overall SVR12 rate in the ITT population (i.e., all patients treated with at least one dose of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir who had SVR12 data available, discontinued early, or were lost to follow-up).

SVR12 rates in the following subgroups of interest (ITT populations) were evaluated: HCV GT (GT1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6), cirrhosis status (no cirrhosis or compensated cirrhosis), HCV treatment history (treatment naïve or treatment experienced [prior HCV treatment with IFN, pegylated-IFN, RBV, and DAAs according to local labels]), and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir treatment duration (8, 12, or 16 weeks).

These analyses were also undertaken in the modified ITT (mITT) population (i.e., the ITT population excluding patients who did not achieve SVR12 for reasons other than virologic failure).

Of note, in the Veterans Affairs (VA) cohort, the mITT population was defined as all patients who received the label-recommended duration of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir; thus, it excluded patients who prematurely discontinued drug but did not exclude patients who did not have SVR12 data.

As a result, sensitivity analyses of efficacy of the mITT population excluding data from the VA cohort were also undertaken.

PARAGRAPH

Other efficacy outcomes were SVR12 rates in treatment-naïve patients who received on-label glecaprevir/pibrentasvir treatment (mITT and ITT populations) and treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients in the following subgroups of interest (mITT populations): severe fibrosis (F3; data included only where F3 was specified), alcohol abuse/dependency, CKD stage 4–5, OST, psychiatric disorder, and proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) use.

Treatment-experienced patients who received on-label glecaprevir/pibrentasvir were not analyzed as insufficient data were reported.

SECTION

Safety

PARAGRAPH

Safety outcomes were the percentages of patients with adverse events (AEs; any grade), common AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), AE of special interest (hepatic decompensation or liver failure), and discontinuation due to AEs.

Patients from cohorts reporting any of these data categories were included in the safety population.

Analyses of each AE category included only those cohorts reporting those data.

SECTION

Data extraction and meta-analysis

PARAGRAPH

Data extraction was performed manually by one reviewer and validated by a second independent reviewer.

The following rules for data abstraction were applied: if the number of patients in the total study population was not available, the number of patients used for the estimation of SVR12 in the ITT population was applied instead; the number of patients used for the estimation of SVR12 in the ITT population was applied to the mITT population if SVR12 in the ITT population was 100%.

Patient numbers were summed across the different GTs if the number of patients in the total study population was not available.

If additional patients were excluded beyond virologic failures, these patients were not used in the mITT population analyses.

If data for patients infected with GT4–6 were reported in combination, these values were not used to determine SVR12 by GT.

The VA does not collect information on the prescribed treatment regimen; therefore, the VA cohort was excluded from the on-label treatment analyses.

PARAGRAPH

Data were analyzed only if reported in at least 2 cohorts.

Random-effects meta-analysis was used to determine SVR12 rates in R with the metafor package.17

The I2 statistic was used to measure statistical heterogeneity between studies.

The I2 statistic estimates the percentage of variability across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance.

Heterogeneity was considered substantial if I2 ≥50%.18

The safety population included all the patients for whom AE rates were reported.

Naïve pooling was used to calculate the following AE rates: overall AE rate, rates of most frequently reported AEs, and the rate of AEs leading to discontinuations.

Results

SECTION

Data sources and patient population

PARAGRAPH

Fig. 1 shows the results of the systematic publication review and screening process.

The database and congress search identified 119 publications, of which 101 were deemed ineligible after screening (see Fig. 1 for reasons).

The final 18 publications included data from 18 unique patient cohorts eligible for analysis, including 3 cohorts from published journal articles (all published in 2019)16,19,20 and 15 cohorts from conference abstracts (4 published in 2019 and 11 in 2018).21–35

Seven studies were undertaken in Europe,16,21–26 6 in Japan,19,20,27–29,35 and 3 in the United States;30–32 there were 2 multi-country studies.33,34

In total, data from 12,531 adults with chronic HCV infection treated with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir were analyzed.

Brief details of the studies included and the baseline demographics and disease characteristics of the patients enrolled in these studies are shown in Table S1.

SECTION

Efficacy analyses: SVR12 rates, overall and by subgroups

PARAGRAPH

Of the 12,531 patients included in the 18 studies, SVR12 data from 8,583 patients were included in the meta-analysis of the ITT population (reported in 15 of the 18 studies).

This included all patients who had SVR12 data available, discontinued early, or were lost to follow-up.

SVR12 rates in the individual cohorts of the ITT population ranged from 92.1% to 100% (Fig. 2).

Results from the 7,001 patients who had SVR12 data available were included in the meta-analysis of the mITT population (reported in 14 of 18 studies; 11 [n = 6,091] that also reported SVR12 in the ITT population and 3 [n = 910] that only reported SVR12 in the mITT population).

SVR12 rates in the individual cohorts of the mITT population ranged from 92.2% to 100% (Fig. 2).

PARAGRAPH

The results from the meta-analysis showed that overall SVR12 rates with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir were 96.7% (95% CI 95.4‒98.1, I2 = 93.1%) in the ITT population (n = 8,583) and 98.1% (95% CI 97.1‒99.2, I2 = 92.3%) in the mITT population (n = 7,001), both with considerable heterogeneity between studies (Fig. 3).

The significant heterogeneity was further examined by excluding the VA study in ITT and mITT populations.

The values of I2 after excluding the VA study (I2 = 90.1% in ITT; I2 = 25.1% in mITT) showed that the significant heterogeneity in the mITT population was caused by the VA study, and SVR12 rates in the mITT population had much greater consistency between studies than in the ITT population when the VA study was excluded.

The SVR12 rate for GT1 (n = 1,972; 6 cohorts) was 95.7% (95% CI 92.6–98.8), for GT2 (n = 600; 8 cohorts) was 97.6% (95% CI 95.4–99.8), for GT3 (n = 1,162; 6 cohorts) was 95.0% (95% CI 92.0–98.0), and for GT4 (n = 121; 3 cohorts) was 99.0% (95% CI 97.2–100) (Fig. 3).

There were insufficient published cohort data to evaluate SVR12 rates for patients infected with HCV GT5 or GT6.

PARAGRAPH

The estimate for SVR12 rate in the ITT population without cirrhosis (n = 4,123; 5 cohorts) was 97.0% (95% CI 94.3–99.7) and in those with compensated cirrhosis (n = 676; 6 cohorts) was 97.8% (95% CI 96.4–99.2) (Fig. 4A).

ITT data were reported in <2 cohorts of HCV treatment-naïve patients and, therefore, only data in the subgroup of patients who were treatment experienced were analyzed.

In HCV treatment-experienced patients (ITT population; n = 262; 6 cohorts), the SVR12 rate was 97.4% (95% CI 95.5–99.3) (Fig. 4B).

The estimates for SVR12 rates in the ITT population prescribed glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for either 8 weeks (n = 1,781; 4 cohorts) or 12 weeks (n = 624; 5 cohorts) were 96.5% (95% CI 93.0–100) and 96.0% (95% CI 93.0–99.1), respectively (Fig. 4C).

There were insufficient published cohort data available to evaluate SVR12 rates for patients prescribed 16 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir treatment (GT3-infected, treatment-experienced patients).

PARAGRAPH

SVR12 rates for the mITT populations were similar to those in the ITT populations for all subgroups (Fig. 3 and 4A‒C).

In a sensitivity analysis that excluded the VA cohort, SVR12 rates for the mITT populations were 98.9% overall and 99.6%, 98.9%, 97.2% and 98.9% for GT1, GT2, GT3, and GT4 subgroups, respectively (Fig. S1).

SVR12 rates were also improved in subgroups by cirrhosis status, treatment experience, and treatment duration when the VA cohort was excluded (Fig. S2A–C).

PARAGRAPH

The virologic failure rate in the mITT population was 2.4% (n/N = 165/7,001).

Of the 165 virologic failures, 91 patients from the VA cohort were considered virologic failures as they did not have SVR12 data in the mITT population.30

When data from the VA cohort were excluded (sensitivity analysis), the virologic failure rate in the mITT population was 1.2% (74/5,834).

No information was available on resistance-associated substitutions.

SECTION

SVR12 rates in treatment-naïve patients who received on-label treatment and by subgroup of interest

PARAGRAPH

The SVR12 rate in the ITT population for treatment-naïve patients without cirrhosis who received on-label treatment (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8 weeks; n = 697; 2 cohorts) was 98.2% (95% CI 96.7–99.6).

The mITT SVR12 rate for treatment-naïve patients without cirrhosis who received on-label treatment for 8 weeks (n = 3,657; 9 cohorts) was 99.3% (95% CI 98.8–99.7); SVR12 rates for GT1–4 ranged from 98.3% to 99.6% (Fig. 5A).

There were insufficient ITT data available (<2 cohorts) for treatment-naïve patients with compensated cirrhosis who received on-label treatment (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 12 weeks).

The mITT SVR12 rate in patients with compensated cirrhosis who received on-label treatment for 12 weeks (n = 362; 7 cohorts) was 99.0% (95% CI 97.9‒100) (Fig. 5B).

PARAGRAPH

There were insufficient data available (<2 cohorts) for an analysis of SVR12 rates in the ITT population for subgroups of interest.

SVR12 rates in the mITT population, in subgroups of interest, were as follows: F3 fibrosis (n = 181; 4 cohorts): 98.5% (95% CI 96.8–100); OST (n = 301; 4 cohorts): 98.9% (95% CI 97.8–100); CKD stage 4–5 (n = 59; 2 cohorts): 99.0% (95% CI 96.5–100); psychiatric disorder (n = 85; 2 cohorts): 98.9 (95% CI 96.8–100); PPI use (n = 180; 3 cohorts): 97.9% (95% CI 95.8–100); alcohol abuse/dependency (n = 106; 2 cohorts): 96.9% (95% CI 93.6–100) (Fig. 6).

SECTION

Safety analysis

PARAGRAPH

Safety data were summarized for 7,199 patients (safety population; 8 cohorts), and AEs were reported in 1,271 patients (17.7%, Table 1).

No single AE was reported with a frequency above 5%; the most frequently reported AEs were pruritus (4.7%), fatigue (4.2%), and headache (2.7%).

Six cohorts included data on SAEs: these were reported in 55 of 5,522 patients (1.0%; including 1 severe AE).

In total, 33 of 5,595 patients (0.6%) discontinued study treatment because of an AE across the 6 cohorts in which these data were reported.

Four patients (4/2,233, 0.2%) who received glecaprevir/pibrentasvir had documented hepatic decompensation events (ascites, n = 1; esophageal varices rupture, n = 1; jaundice, n = 2; Table 2).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Real-world studies enable evaluation of treatment effectiveness, safety, and prescribing patterns in routine clinical practice.

They provide valuable information for clinicians, patients, policymakers, and payers and are an important complement to the results obtained from clinical trials.

The results of this meta-analysis indicate that glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is an effective and well-tolerated pangenotypic treatment option for patients with chronic HCV infection in real-world clinical practice.

PARAGRAPH

Of the 12,531 patients included in the studies in this meta-analysis, 8,583 patients had SVR12 results, were lost to follow-up, or prematurely discontinued and thus, were included in the ITT population.

This decrease in patient number is because several of the studies were ongoing at the time of presentation or publication so SVR12 data were not available on all patients, and because 3 studies did not report on the ITT population at all.

PARAGRAPH

The effectiveness and safety of a treatment in clinical practice may differ from those observed in clinical trials, because of a more heterogeneous real-world population that often includes patients who were excluded from clinical trials during drug development, such as those with multiple comorbidities including, psychiatric disorders, diabetes, and substance abuse, which have been shown to decrease the likelihood of achieving SVR.36

Although the SVR12 rates in the individual cohorts of the ITT population were all >92%, rates from 92.1% to 100% combined with cohort sizes from 20 to 1,625 resulted in a high measurement of heterogeneity (I2 >90).

There was similar heterogeneity in the SVR12 rates and cohort sizes in the mITT population; however, excluding the VA cohort in sensitivity analyses of the mITT population greatly decreased the heterogeneity (I2 = 25.1%) because the VA cohort was both the largest cohort and had the lowest SVR12 rate.

Despite high heterogeneity between the cohorts included, the overall ITT SVR12 rate in this meta-analysis of real-world data (96.7%) is consistent with the ITT SVR12 rate achieved across the glecaprevir/pibrentasvir clinical development program (97.5%).1

Indeed, the ITT SVR12 rates with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in this meta-analysis were uniformly high (≥95.0%) irrespective of GT and in populations often considered more challenging to treat, such as HCV treatment-experienced patients, patients with cirrhosis, those who use illicit drugs/OST, those with psychiatric disorders, and those taking PPIs.36–39

PARAGRAPH

The overall mITT SVR12 rate was also high in this meta-analysis (98.1%) and comparable with that observed in clinical trials (99.1%).40

The virologic failure rate was 2.4%.

Because the mITT population for the VA cohort included patients without an SVR12 rate as well as those with virologic failure, sensitivity analyses of the SVR12 rates for the mITT population were conducted excluding the VA cohort.

In these sensitivity analyses, the overall SVR12 rate was 98.9% and the virologic failure rate was 1.2%, similar to the rates seen in registrational trials.40

PARAGRAPH

It is important to report mITT SVR12 rates in subpopulations in which there is suspicion of lower efficacy; thus, mITT SVR12 rates were presented for most cohorts by labeled regimen or comorbidities.

Looking at subpopulations of interest, the mITT SVR12 rate in patients who used OST in this meta-analysis (98.9%) was similar to the mITT rate reported in patients receiving OST in clinical trials (99.3%) in which adherence to treatment was high (98%).7

This is particularly important given the evolving epidemiology of HCV in some countries.

The number of younger people with milder disease (fibrosis stage F0–F1) who are infected with HCV is increasing,41 and the majority of new cases in these younger patients occur in those who use illicit injectable drugs.41,42

The mITT SVR12 rate in patients with CKD stage 4–5 in this meta-analysis (99.0%) was also similar to that reported in a clinical study (100%).8

PARAGRAPH

The introduction of highly effective DAA therapies with short durations of treatment that can cure HCV infection has transformed the treatment landscape in recent years.

In this meta-analysis, the SVR12 rates were high in patients who received glecaprevir/pibrentasvir treatment for 8 weeks (96.5% in the ITT population and 97.9% in the mITT population).

In treatment-naïve patients without cirrhosis who received on-label treatment for 8 weeks, the mITT SVR12 rate was 99.3%, similar to that seen in the glecaprevir/pibrentasvir clinical development program (99.2%).1

One group of particular interest is patients infected with HCV GT3 as they are considered a more difficult-to-treat population.

The SVR12 rate for treatment-naïve patients with GT3 treated for 8 weeks with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in this meta-analysis of real-world data was 99.2% (mITT population), which is higher than the rates seen in the registrational trials (ITT SVR12, 95.2%; mITT SVR12, 97.5%).43

For HCV-infected patients with compensated cirrhosis, current international guidelines for HCV management recommend treatment for at least 12 weeks.4,44

In this meta-analysis, the mITT SVR12 rate was 99.0% in treatment-naïve patients with compensated cirrhosis who received on-label treatment for 12 weeks.

Data suggest that an 8-week treatment course with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir may be as effective as a 12-week treatment course in HCV treatment-naïve patients with compensated cirrhosis.45,46

A clinical trial using an 8-week treatment regimen for treatment-naïve patients infected with HCV GT1–6 infection who have compensated cirrhosis has been completed.46

At the time of this meta-analysis, there were no pangenotypic regimens approved for 8 weeks in all treatment-naïve patients with compensated cirrhosis.

Based on the results of EXPEDITION-8 study, the European Medicines Agency has granted marketing authorization and the US Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8 weeks in treatment-naïve patients with compensated cirrhosis and HCV genotypes 1–6.1,2

PARAGRAPH

In May 2016, the World Health Assembly adopted the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Sector Strategy on Viral Hepatitis, 2016‒2021.

The aim is to eliminate HCV as a major public health threat by 2030, by reducing new infections by 80% and HCV-related deaths by 65%, which requires 90% of individuals with chronic HCV infection to be diagnosed and 80% of those diagnosed to be treated.47,48

In 2015, only 20% (14 million) of the estimated 71 million individuals living with chronic HCV worldwide were aware that they were infected,47 and in 2016, only 13% of those aware of having chronic HCV were being treated.47

To help eradicate HCV, the WHO recommends treating all adults with chronic HCV infection and advocates using pangenotypic DAA regimens, which they state are highly effective and well tolerated with only minor adverse effects, based on data from clinical studies.48

The tolerability profile of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in this meta-analysis was similar to that reported in ~2,300 patients participating in the clinical development program, with headache and fatigue among the most commonly reported AEs and <1% of patients discontinuing treatment because of AEs.1

Pruritus was the most common AE reported in this meta-analysis, possibly mediated at least in part by DAA-driven alterations to bile acid metabolism or protease regulation.49,50

Additionally, pruritus is commonly observed in specific HCV-infected populations, such as patients with renal impairment51,52 or cirrhosis.53,54

These populations are represented in the cohorts included in this meta-analysis.

Hepatic decompensation events were rare (reported in <0.2% of patients).

Information regarding these events and the patients who developed these events are not available, precluding further analysis.

Taken together, these real-world data support the use of pangenotypic glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in all patients with HCV, irrespective of whether they were historically considered more challenging to treat, to help achieve the WHO goal of HCV elimination.

PARAGRAPH

Although data from meta-analyses are considered to be among the most robust, this meta-analysis has a number of limitations.

The level of detail reported across the individual studies was inconsistent; indeed, because of the relatively recent approval of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for the treatment of chronic HCV infection, most real-world data were only available in congress presentations.

This lack of consistency was also illustrated by SVR12 rates in the mITT population being reported in 3 studies that did not report SVR12 rates in the ITT population.

There were insufficient data available to analyze SVR12 rates in patients with HCV GT5 or GT6 infection and those who received 16 weeks’ treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, and data from only a small number of patients were available for some subgroups of interest.

Furthermore, no data were available for the 165 patients who experienced virologic failure.

Finally, manual data extraction may have been subject to error (although this was a relatively small dataset).

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, the results of this meta-analysis demonstrate that the real-world effectiveness and safety of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in more than 12,000 patients were consistent with those observed in clinical trials.

Furthermore, real-world evidence indicates that glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is a highly effective and well-tolerated pangenotypic treatment option for a broad range of patients with chronic HCV infection, regardless of patient characteristics, supporting its use in HCV eradication programs and its inclusion in the WHO clinical recommendations to adopt a pangenotypic DAA regimen and to treat all patients.48
