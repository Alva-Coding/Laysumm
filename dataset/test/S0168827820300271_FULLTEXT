TITLE

Functions of human liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells depend on HIF-2α activity in healthy and pathologic livers

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

The liver is an immunologically unique organ in terms of the regulation of immuno-tolerance and immune responses.

It preferentially induces immuno-tolerance, which explains why even major histocompatibility complex–mismatched liver allografts tend to survive without rejection1 and why HBV and HCV can easily establish chronic persistent infections in the organ.1

Under certain circumstances, however, immune responses can be robustly induced in the liver.

For example, the liver is often injured by immune-mediated mechanisms in cases of viral hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis.2-4

The liver harbors unique immune cell populations involved in intrahepatic immune responses.

Kupffer cells are liver phagocytes, hepatic stellate cells play an immunological role,5 and natural killer cells and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells accumulate in the liver.6,7

Conventional αβ T cells can exert local immune responses in the liver, but the extent of their role in liver immune responses is not fully elucidated.

PARAGRAPH

Recently, non-recirculating tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells were found in various peripheral organs.8-10

TRM cells exhibit the phenotype of effector memory T (TEM) cells or CD45RA+ effector memory T (TEMRA) cells.8

TRM cells express CD69 with or without αE integrin (CD103) as well as low levels of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR1) and Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), which are related to tissue egress.8,10,11

TRM cells are commonly found in non-lymphoid tissues including the skin, lung, gastrointestinal and genital tracts, brain, and kidney, where they rapidly respond to re-encountered pathogens.9,12,13

TRM cells have been observed in the livers of mice and humans.14-17

In mice, liver-resident CD69+CD103-CD8+ memory T cells patrol the liver sinusoidal areas and protect the tissue against hepatotropic pathogens.14,18

In humans, a large population of CD69+CD8+ memory T cells residing in liver sinusoids shows reduced cytotoxicity.16

Less than 10% of these liver sinusoidal CD69+CD8+ memory T cells are CD103+, with the remaining 90% being CD103-.

CD103+ cells exhibit a TEM phenotype and robustly produce cytokines including interleukin (IL)-2 upon antigen stimulation.15

The immunologic characteristics of CD103- cells, however, remain unknown.

PARAGRAPH

CD103 is an αE integrin that forms heterodimers with β7 integrin to recognize E-cadherin, which is an adherens junction protein expressed in epithelial cells including hepatocytes.19,20

CD103 is found in various immune cells including dendritic cells, innate lymphoid cells, mast cells, and T cells.21-24

In CD8+ T cells, CD103 expression increases in response to tissue localization and exposure to transforming growth factor-β.25,26

As noted, CD103, in concert with CD69, is an important marker for identifying TRM cells.

CD103 mediates the long-term retention of TRM cells in the brain and in epithelial tissues,25,27 although T cell recruitment to the tissues is unaffected by CD103 expression.26,28

PARAGRAPH

Here, we analyzed the immunologic characteristics of liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ memory T cells.

This major population of liver CD69+CD8+ memory T cells exhibits a feature of tissue residency and terminal differentiation.

CD103- cells resist activation-induced cell death and respond less to anti-CD3 and interleukin (IL)-15 than CD103+ cells.

CD103- cells comprise non-hepatotropic virus-specific T cells as well as hepatotropic virus-specific T cells, but CD103+ cells exhibit only hepatotropic virus specificity.

We found that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2α is overexpressed in liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells and that HIF-2α activity is required for the activation and survival of these cells.

We also examined the expression of HIF-2α in liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells from patients with acute or chronic liver diseases and its association with the clinical severity of liver disease.

Flow cytometry

PARAGRAPH

Frozen PBMCs and LSMCs were thawed and stained with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I pentamers for 15 min at room temperature.

Following pentamer staining, fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies for specific surface markers were stained for 10 min at room temperature.

Dead cells were excluded using LIVE/DEAD red fluorescent reactive dye (Invitrogen) or 7-AAD (BD Biosciences).

For staining intracellular markers other than HIF-2α, surface-stained cells were further fixed and permeabilized with a FoxP3 staining buffer kit (Invitrogen) and then stained with intracellular markers for 30 min at 4°C.

For staining HIF-2α, surface-stained cells were incubated in intracellular fixation buffer (Invitrogen) for 10 min at room temperature, followed by fixation with 100% cold methanol for 40 min at 4°C.

Results

SECTION

Liver sinusoidal CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells exhibit tissue-resident memory features

PARAGRAPH

Herein, we report on our characterization of the immunological properties of LSMCs from donor liver perfusates obtained during living-donor liver transplantations.

The gating strategy we used for flow cytometric analysis of these cells is shown in Fig. S1A. To focus on conventional αβ T cells, we excluded T cell receptor (TCR) γ/δ+ γδ T cells and TCRα7.2+CD161+ MAIT cells from the analysis (Fig. S1A).

First, we examined the expression of CD69 in liver sinusoidal CD8+ T cells.

The frequency of CD69+CD8+ T cells in liver sinusoidal CD8+ T cells was significantly higher than that of CD8+ T cells in PBMCs (Fig. S1B).

We confirmed the presence of CD69+CD8+ T cells in the liver sinusoidal space (Fig. S1C) and then examined whether these CD69+CD8+ T cells showed tissue-resident features.

Liver sinusoidal CD69+CD8+ T cells exhibited low levels of KLF2 and S1PR1 mRNA compared to peripheral blood CD8+ T cells or liver sinusoidal CD69-CD8+ T cells (Fig. S1D).

They did not express CCR7 (Fig. S1E).

We further found that roughly 95% of CD69+CD8+ T cells were CD103- and roughly 5% were CD103+ (Fig. 1A).

Both subsets were mostly memory cells without a CCR7+CD45RA+ naïve population (Fig. 1B).

These findings were already described in previous works with liver perfusate.15,16

Furthermore, CXCR6, a liver-homing marker, and adhesion molecules such as LFA-1 and CD49a were upregulated in CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells, although CD103- cells expressed less CD49a than CD103+ cells (Fig. 1C).

CX3CR1 was downregulated in CD69+CD103+CD8+ and CD69+CD103-CD8+ cells compared to liver CD69-CD8+ T cells and peripheral blood CD8+ T cells (Fig. 1D), consistent with the feature of TRM cells in previous findings.29

These findings suggest that the CD69+CD103-CD8+ memory T cells have a tissue-resident phenotype among the various subsets of LSMCs.

SECTION

Liver sinusoidal CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells are terminally differentiated memory cells

PARAGRAPH

To clarify the other differences that separate the CD103- and CD103+ liver sinusoidal CD69+CD8+ T cell subsets, we examined cell surface markers, transcription factors, and telomere lengths.

We observed an enrichment of TEMRA cells in the CD103- subset and an enrichment of TEM cells in the CD103+ subset (Fig. 2A).

The CD103- subset showed fewer CD28+ cells and more CD57+ cells than the CD103+ subset (Fig. 2B), indicating that the CD103- cells were more replicatively senescent T cells.30,31

Moreover, the CD103- subset showed more KLRG1+ (Fig. 2C) or T-betlowEomeshi cells (Fig. 2D), which were terminally differentiated, and shorter telomeres than the CD103+ subset (Fig. 2E).30,31

Together, these data suggest that CD103- cells are replicatively senescent, terminally differentiated cells.

PARAGRAPH

Furthermore, we examined activation markers (i.e., CD38 and HLA-DR), a proliferation marker (i.e., Ki-67), an apoptosis marker (i.e., FAS), and an exhaustion marker (i.e., PD-1).

Although the CD103- subset showed more CD38+ cells (Fig. 2F) than the CD103+ subset, the CD103- subset showed fewer Ki-67+ cells and lower expression of FAS (Fig. 2G and H), suggesting that CD103- cells were less proliferative and less apoptotic.

The frequencies of HLA-DR+ cells (Fig. 2F) and PD-1+ (Fig. 2I) cells were similar between each subset.

SECTION

HIF-2α is specifically upregulated in liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells

PARAGRAPH

Next, we examined transcription regulators specific to liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells.

First, we screened the gene expression profile in liver sinusoidal CD8+ T cells by performing microarray analysis after sorting HLA-A∗0201-cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65495-503 pentamer+CD8+ T cells from paired LSMCs and PBMCs.

Analysis of differentially expressed genes in liver sinusoidal CMV-specific CD8+ T cells revealed 51 significantly upregulated and 76 significantly downregulated genes.

Of the top 10 upregulated genes, only EPAS1 and ALX4 were transcription factors (Fig. 3A).

EPAS1, which encodes HIF-2α, was further studied because enhanced HIF activity in CD8+ T cells is associated with effector functions.32,33

We then sorted CD103- and CD103+ cells from liver sinusoidal CD69+CD8+ T cells and examined the mRNA expression of selected genes by quantitative reverse transcription PCR.

EPAS1 was significantly upregulated in the CD103- cell population compared to the CD103+ population, whereas HIF1A was not (Fig. 3B and C).

Among genes associated with tissue residency (i.e., CD69, ITGAE, CXCR6, S1PR1, KLF2, ZNF683, PRDM1, IGSF2, and RUNX3), both populations exhibited similar gene expression levels, except for ITGAE, ZNF683, and RUNX3 (Fig. 3B and D).

We confirmed the upregulation of HIF-2α protein in CD103- cells compared to CD103+ cells by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 3E).

These data indicate that HIF-2α is specifically upregulated in liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells.

PARAGRAPH

To investigative whether the characteristics of the CD103- subset are specific to the liver, we analyzed CD8+ T cells from normal non-tumoral colon, kidney, and lung tissues (n = 6 each), which were obtained during surgical resection of malignant tumors.

In contrast to liver CD8+ T cells, the CD69+CD103+ cell population was dominant among colon CD8+ T cells (Fig. S2A).

Among kidney and lung CD8+ T cells, both the CD69+CD103+ and CD69+CD103- cell populations were present (Fig. S2A).

As in liver CD8+ T cells, the CD69+CD103- cell population had more CXCR6+ cells than CD69- cells among colon, kidney, and lung CD8+ T cells, though they had fewer CXCR6+ cells than CD69+CD103+ cells among kidney and lung CD8+ T cells (Fig. S2B).

HIF-2α expression was not upregulated in CD69+CD103-CD8+ cells from colon and lung tissues (Fig. S2C).

However, HIF-2α expression was upregulated in both the CD69+CD103+ and CD69+CD103- cell populations compared to the CD69- cell population in the kidney (Fig. S2C).

SECTION

HIF-2α activity maintains the function and survival of liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells

PARAGRAPH

We next examined the TCR responsiveness of CD103- and CD103+ cells of CD69+CD8+ T cells.

Because CD69 is upregulated when T cells are activated, we sorted CD69+CD8+ T cells from LSMCs and stimulated them with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 in the presence of irradiated CD8- cells from autologous LSMCs.

We then analyzed their effector functions by performing intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) for interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and IL-2.

We also evaluated degranulating cytotoxic activity as we performed the ICS technique by adding fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD107a to the culture.

The CD103- subset showed weaker responses for each effector function than the CD103+ subset (Fig. 4A), but more than 85% of the CD69+CD8+ T cells producing IFN-γ after TCR stimulation were the CD103- subset (Fig. 4B).

We obtained similar results with TNF- or IL-2–producing T cells and in CD107a+ degranulating T cells after TCR stimulation (Fig. 4B).

When we compared anti-CD3-induced effector functions between the CD103+ and CD103- cell populations in colon, kidney, and lung CD8+ T cells, lung CD69+CD103- cells exhibited lower effector functions than CD69+CD103+ cells, whereas no difference was found in colon and kidney CD69+CD103- and CD69+CD103+ cells (Fig. S3A-C).

We also evaluated cell death following TCR stimulation by staining with 7-AAD and annexin V.

The CD103- subset showed fewer apoptotic (annexin V+) cells than the CD103+ subset (Fig. 4C).

These data indicate that although CD103- cells exert only weak effector functions on a per cell basis, they are the major effector population among TCR-stimulated CD69+CD8+ T cells, surviving with less cell death.

PARAGRAPH

To investigative whether the characteristics of the CD103- subset are responsible for the TEM or TEMRA subset, we gated the TEM and TEMRA cell populations separately among CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells and compared the expression of tissue residency markers, effector functions, survival, and the expression of HIF-2α between the 2 populations.

Among CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells, TEMRA cells had similar frequencies of CXCR6+ and LFA-1+ cells as TEM cells (Fig. S4A).

Upon anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation, TEMRA cells had similar frequencies of IFN-γ+, TNF+, IL-2+, and CD107a+ cells as TEM cells (Fig. S4B), though the percentage of apoptotic cells was less in TEMRA cells than TEM cells (Fig. S4C).

HIF-2α expression was significantly higher in TEMRA cells than TEM cells (Fig. S4D).

We also compared the expression of tissue residency markers, effector functions, survival, and the expression of HIF-2α between CD103+ and CD103- cells following gating of CD69+CD8+ TEM cells and found that all data were maintained, even after exclusion of TEMRA cells, except HIF-2α expression (Fig. S4A-D).

These data indicate that a high level of HIF2α expression in CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells is attributed to the TEMRA cell population.

PARAGRAPH

Next, to examine if HIF-2α+CD103- cells produce more cytokines, we stimulated LSMCs with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 for 6 h.

We confirmed that the expression of HIF-2α was not changed during 6 h stimulation (Fig. S5A).

In this experiment, IFN-γ and TNF were predominantly produced by HIF-2α+ cells (Fig. 4D).

Next, we successfully knocked down HIF-2α expression using EPAS1-specific siRNAs (Fig. 4E).

Among CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells, TCR-induced IFN-γ and TNF production was significantly decreased by EPAS1-specific siRNA compared to control siRNA (Fig. 4F).

Furthermore, we used the HIF-2α–specific inhibitor PT-2385 and confirmed the activity of PT-2385 in downregulating the expression of HIF-2α-downstream genes such as NDRG1 and SLC2A1 (Fig. S5B).

In liver sinusoidal CD69+CD8+ T cells, PT-2385 suppressed TCR-induced IFN-γ and TNF production from CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells, whereas it did not suppress cytokine production from CD69+CD103+CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4G).

Of interest, we found that PT-2385 also increased TCR-induced cell death of CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4H).

These data indicate that HIF-2α activity is required to maintain the effector functions and survival of liver sinusoidal CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells.

SECTION

Liver sinusoidal CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells include both cells with specificity for hepatotropic and non-hepatotropic viruses

PARAGRAPH

We investigated the antigen specificity of the CD103- and CD103+ subsets using HLA class I pentamers.

First, we examined the LSMCs from liver transplant recipients with chronic HBV infection and found both CD103- and CD103+ subsets among the HBV-specific CD69+CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5A).

We observed more indicators of terminal differentiation (i.e., a higher frequency of TEMRA cells, CD57+ cells, and T-betlowEomeshi cells) among HBV-specific CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells than HBV-specific CD69+CD103+CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5B).

In addition, HIF-2α expression was upregulated in HBV-specific CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells compared to the CD103+ counterpart (Fig. 5C).

When we stimulated LSMCs with HBVcore overlapping peptides (OLPs), we observed a lower frequency of IFN-γ+, TNF+, and IL-2+ cells among the CD103- subset than among the CD103+ subset (Fig. 5D).

We found that PT-2385 suppressed HBVcore OLP-induced cytokine production from the CD103- subset, but not from the CD103+ subset (Fig. 5E).

PARAGRAPH

We also examined CD69+CD8+ T cells specific to non-hepatotropic viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), CMV, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

Among the IAV-, RSV-, CMV-, or EBV-specific CD69+CD8+ T cells we examined, we found only the CD103- subset, not the CD103+ subset (Fig. 5F).

This result was observed in not only HBV-infected liver perfusates (triangles in Fig. 5F) but also healthy donors’ liver perfusates (circles in Fig. 5F).

When we compared the relative frequencies of various virus-specific CD8+ T cells, we found that CMV-specific CD8+ T cells were dominant among CD69+CD103- cells (Fig. S6A).

When we compared the frequency of CD69+CD103- cells among CD8+ T cells between CMV sero-negative and -positive individuals, we found that the frequency of CD69+CD103- cells did not differ between the 2 groups (Fig. S6B).

PARAGRAPH

When we analyzed liver-infiltrating T cells obtained from liver tissues, we confirmed that CD103- cells expressing CXCR6 were the dominant population among CD69+CD8+ T cells.

We also found enrichment of TEMRA cells and upregulation of HIF-2α in the CD103- subset (Fig. 5G).

We confirmed these data using liver tissues.

Importantly, as with the liver perfusates, all the CMV-specific CD69+CD8+ T cells were CD103-, whereas HBV-specific CD69+CD8+ T cells included both CD103- and CD103+ subsets (Fig. 5H).

PARAGRAPH

Taking these data together, we conclude that both cells with specificity for hepatotropic and non-hepatotropic viruses are present among CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells whereas only hepatotropic virus-specific cells are present among CD69+CD103+CD8+ T cells.

SECTION

HIF-2α activity regulates the IL-15-induced, TCR-independent cytotoxic function of liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells

PARAGRAPH

Although non-hepatotropic virus-specific T cells are found in the hepatic CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cell population, they might not encounter cognate antigens in the liver environment.

However, there is a chance of cytokine-induced bystander activation during heterologous viral infection.

Recently, we demonstrated that IL-15 stimulates bystander memory CD8+ T cells to exert NKG2D- or NKp30-dependent, TCR-independent innate-like cytotoxic function during acute hepatitis A (AHA).3

To examine the responsiveness of the CD103- and CD103+ subsets to IL-15, we assessed their proliferation (e.g., Celltrace VioletTM [CTV] and Ki-67) and NKG2D expression.

The CD103- subset showed fewer CTVlow or Ki-67+ proliferating cells than the CD103+ subset (Fig. 6A) but similar levels of NKG2D upregulation (Fig. 6B).

We also performed innate-like cytotoxic assays with IL-15–stimulated CD69+CD8+ T cells co-cultured with HLA class I–deficient K562 cells to evaluate their CD107a degranulating cytotoxic activity.

In this assay, the CD103- subset showed fewer CD107a+ cells than the CD103+ subset (Fig. 6C).

Still, more than 60% of the CD107a+ degranulating CD69+CD8+ T cells were CD103- (Fig. 6D).

PARAGRAPH

Of importance, we found that PT-2385 inhibits the innate-like cytotoxicity of IL-15–activated CD69+CD8+ T cells against K562 cells (Fig. 6E).

Upon further analysis, we found that PT-2385 inhibits the CD107a degranulating activity of IL-15–treated CD103- cells during innate-like cytotoxic assays, but not that of IL-15–treated CD103+ cells (Fig. 6F).

Together, these data suggest that HIF-2α activity is required to maintain the IL-15–induced, TCR-independent cytotoxic function of liver sinusoidal CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells as well as their TCR-stimulated effector functions.

PARAGRAPH

When we examined CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells in liver tissue from patients with AHA, we found that more than 95% of CD69+CD8+ T cells were CD103- (Fig. 6G).

As with normal liver, most CD103- cells expressed CXCR6, and the CD103- subset tended to have more TEMRA cells and express more HIF-2α than the CD103+ subset (Fig. 6G).

We also found that HIF-2α expression by liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells was increased in patients with AHA compared to controls (Fig. 6H).

SECTION

HIF-2α upregulation in liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ cells is associated with liver failure in patients with cirrhosis

PARAGRAPH

Finally, we analyzed liver sinusoidal CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells from patients with cirrhosis (n = 24) compared to healthy donors (n = 12).

The relative frequency of CD38+ and Ki-67+ cells was significantly increased among CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells from patients with cirrhosis compared to healthy controls (Fig. 7A), indicating that CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells from patients with cirrhosis are more activated.

In addition, the expression of HIF-2α was significantly increased in CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells from patients with cirrhosis (Fig. 7B) and positively correlated with the relative frequency of CD38+ cells among CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells (Fig. 7C).

In functional analysis, anti-CD3-stimulated production of cytokines, such as IFN-γ, TNF, and IL-2, was significantly increased in CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells from patients with cirrhosis (Fig. 7D).

The anti-CD3-stimulated production of cytokines by CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells from patients with cirrhosis was decreased in the presence of PT-2385 (Fig. 7E), whereas no significant difference was found with the CD103+ counterpart (Fig. S7).

Interestingly, the expression of HIF-2α in liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells significantly correlated with the clinical severity of cirrhosis, including model for end-stage liver disease score and Child-Pugh classification (Fig. 7F).

Taken together, these data indicate that HIF-2α is upregulated in activated liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells from patients with cirrhosis and is involved in the progression of cirrhosis.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Liver-resident memory CD8+ T cells were first reported in mice,14 in which liver sinusoidal CD69+CD103-CD8+ memory T cells are liver-resident cells that protect against hepatotropic pathogens.14

In humans, liver sinusoidal CD69+CD103+CD8+ memory T cells are tissue resident and robustly produce IL-2 and IFN-γ under antigen stimulation.15

A study of human liver sinusoidal CD69+CD8+ T cells that did not classify them according to their CD103 expression found that liver CD69+CD8+ T cells have a TRM cell phenotype.16

Because roughly 95% of human liver sinusoidal CD69+CD8+ T cells are CD103-, those results likely reflect what would have been obtained if the study had been limited to the CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cell population.

Indeed, here, we found that liver sinusoidal CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells exhibit tissue-resident memory features.

PARAGRAPH

Upon further analysis, we found liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells are CD45RA+CCR7-CD28-CD57+ and contain shortened telomeres.

This phenotype is compatible with that of terminally differentiated memory T cells that have already undergone replicative senescence following repetitive antigenic stimulation.30,31

Functional analysis showed that the effector functions of CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells are attenuated on a per cell basis compared to CD69+CD103+CD8+ T cells.

Nevertheless, because CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells represent roughly 95% of liver CD69+CD8+ T cells, they are the major population of liver CD69+CD8+ T cells contributing to TCR-stimulated effector functions.

PARAGRAPH

HIFs are transcription regulators that respond to hypoxia.

In hypoxic conditions, HIF-1α and HIF-2α accumulate, form heterodimers with HIF-1β, and enter the nucleus.34

In T cells, the expression and stabilization of HIFs can be triggered by TCR stimulation as well as by hypoxia.33,35

Enhanced HIF activity in CD8+ T cells promotes effector functions and glycolytic metabolism.32,33

In T cells, HIF-1α plays a key role in glycolysis,36 but the role of HIF-2α remains unclear.34

Here, we found that HIF-2α expression is upregulated in liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells.

Of note, RNA sequencing revealed upregulation of HIF-2α mRNA in human and mouse lung-resident memory CD8+ T cells.37

Further studies are required to determine whether HIF-2α expression is upregulated in the TRM cells of other peripheral tissues.

PARAGRAPH

We next found that PT-2385, a specific inhibitor of HIF-2α, increases cell death in TCR-stimulated CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells but not in similarly treated CD69+CD103+CD8+ T cells.

This result suggests that HIF-2α is important in the survival and maintenance of CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells.

Others have observed a similar anti-apoptotic role for HIF-2α in hematopoietic stem cells.38

We also found that PT-2385 suppresses the production of IFN-γ and TNF in CD69+CD103-CD8+ memory T cells after TCR stimulation, indicating that HIF-2α activity is required for cytokine production from CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells.

Importantly, HIF-2α expression is increased during liver pathology and positively correlates with impaired liver functions in patients with cirrhosis, indicating a possible role of HIF-2α and liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells in the progression of liver disease.

PT-2385 was originally developed for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma.39,40

Future studies should test whether PT-2385 can be used to alleviate the progression of various liver diseases.

PARAGRAPH

In functional studies of liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells, we stimulated them not only with anti-CD3 but also with IL-15.

In a recent investigation, we demonstrated that IL-15 activates antigen-nonspecific bystander CD8+ memory T cells to express NKG2D and NKp30 and to exert TCR-independent innate-like cytotoxicity during AHA in humans.3

Moreover, we showed that the innate-like cytotoxicity of bystander-activated CD8+ memory T cells is associated with immunopathologic liver injuries during HAV infection.3

Given that CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells include CD8+ T cells specific to non-hepatotropic viruses, we hypothesize that antigen-nonspecific activation mechanisms (e.g., IL-15) may be important in the action of liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells.

After IL-15 treatment, CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells show lower levels of proliferation and CD107a degranulating cytotoxic activity on a per cell basis than CD69+CD103+CD8+ T cells.

We found, however, that more than half of CD107a+ degranulating T cells among CD69+CD8+ T cells are CD103- cells, suggesting that CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells are important in IL-15–induced innate-like cytotoxicity in the liver.

Of interest, we found that PT-2385 suppresses the CD107a degranulating cytotoxic activity of CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells, but not that of CD69+CD103+CD8+ T cells.

This result indicates that HIF-2α plays a role in the effector functions of CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells induced by TCR-independent IL-15 stimulation as well as by TCR stimulation.

PARAGRAPH

Interestingly, the CD69+CD103+CD8+ T cell population has only hepatotropic virus-specific cells, whereas the CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cell population has both hepatotropic and non-hepatotropic viruses-specific cells, suggesting that CD69+CD103+CD8+ T cells are bona fide TRM cells.

However, CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells exhibited TRM-like features in terms of phenotype and gene expression profile.

In addition, the percentage of CD103- cells among HBV-specific CD8+ T cells ranged from 5% to 96%, indicating that both CD103+ and CD103- cells contribute to immune responses against hepatotropic viruses.

PARAGRAPH

In summary, we found that most liver CD69+CD8+ memory T cells are CD103- cells that have tissue resident and terminally differentiated phenotype.

Liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells include both hepatotropic and non-hepatotropic virus-specific cells.

HIF-2α is overexpressed in CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells, and a HIF-2α inhibitor suppresses TCR-induced activation, survival, and IL-15–induced innate-like cytotoxicity of CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells.

The expression of HIF-2α is increased in CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells in livers with pathology, including AHA or cirrhosis.

This increased expression is associated with the activation of liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells and severely impaired liver functions in patients with cirrhosis.

The current study suggests that human liver CD69+CD103-CD8+ T cells overexpressing HIF-2α play an important role in the immune responses in liver tissues and pathogenesis of human liver disease.
