TITLE

Physical activity compared to adiposity and risk of liver-related mortality: Results from two prospective, nationwide cohorts

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

In 2016, more than 34,000 Americans died from chronic liver disease, which includes death from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and from other complications of cirrhosis.1,2

Over the past 20 years, the prevalence of cirrhosis in the US has doubled, and rates of liver-related mortality have increased by more than 65%,2 due in part to the growing epidemics of obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Despite this, knowledge of modifiable lifestyle factors remains incomplete, and effective strategies to prevent liver-related mortality are lacking.

PARAGRAPH

Obesity and physical inactivity represent major public health problems for patients with chronic liver disease.

Approximately 80% of Americans with NAFLD are overweight,3 and most do not engage in physical activity,4 even when their liver disease is mild.5,6

Obesity is a risk factor for cirrhosis,7,8 HCC9–12 and liver-related death.7,13

Furthermore, physical activity is inversely associated with HCC incidence,9 and in short-term clinical studies, physical activity interventions improve liver fat, inflammation and fibrosis, even in the absence of weight loss.14–17

However, whether this translates to long-term reductions in liver-related mortality is unknown.

While it has been suggested that achieving higher levels of fitness might eliminate the adverse effects of obesity on long-term hepatic outcomes,18,19 evidence to support this hypothesis is lacking.

To date, no prospective epidemiologic study has simultaneously evaluated the long-term influence of physical activity and adiposity on liver-related mortality.

PARAGRAPH

Numerous national subspecialty societies provide specific physical activity recommendations for the prevention of cancer,20 heart disease,21 and other chronic conditions.22,23

In contrast, no recommendations currently exist for the prevention of major adverse hepatic events, including death from cirrhosis and from HCC.

Given the growing burden of chronic liver disease, understanding the optimal level of activity to prevent liver-related mortality remains an important unmet need.

PARAGRAPH

Thus, we prospectively evaluated the relationships between physical activity, adiposity and liver-related mortality, within 2 nationwide populations of men and women in the US.

Specifically, we assessed whether achieving higher levels of activity might counteract the association between excess body weight and liver-related mortality.

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Participants

PARAGRAPH

The Nurses' Health Study (NHS) prospectively enrolled 121,700 female registered nurses, aged 30–55 years, in 1976, and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) prospectively enrolled 51,529 male health professionals, aged 40–75 years, in 1986.24,25

Since enrollment, participants have returned detailed biennial questionnaires, providing prospectively updated data on lifestyle, medical history, physical activity and disease outcomes, with follow-up that consistently exceeds 90%.26

We included all individuals from both cohorts who completed the first comprehensive physical activity assessment in 1986.27,28

We excluded anyone with missing information on baseline physical activity or body mass index (BMI), self-reported cirrhosis (n = 775), viral hepatitis (n = 305), or prior cancer, except non-melanoma skin cancer (n = 8,366), consistent with prior work.29

This left 125,264 participants (77,238 women, 48,026 men), eligible for analysis.

PARAGRAPH

The NHS and HPFS cohorts were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (1999-P-011114), and those of participating registries as required.

Return of questionnaires was considered as informed consent.

SECTION

Assessments of adiposity

PARAGRAPH

BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (kg/m2) in 1986, and biennially thereafter.

The validity and reliability of these measurements in these cohorts have previously been demonstrated (r = 0.97 for men and women).30

The baseline questionnaire queried early adulthood weight (i.e. 21 years [men] and 18 years [women]), which has been validated (r = 0.87).31

We constructed 3 BMI exposures: cumulative average updated BMI, calculated from all questionnaires up to the start of each 2-year interval, early adulthood BMI, and mid-life BMI (in 1986).

PARAGRAPH

Abdominal adiposity was defined using validated waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) measurements, reported in HPFS in 1987 and 1996, and in NHS in 1986, 1996 and 2000.30

The correlation coefficients between self-reported and technician-measured WC and hip circumferences were 0.95 and 0.88, respectively, among men, and 0.89 and 0.84, respectively, among women.30

SECTION

Physical activity and covariate assessment

PARAGRAPH

Detailed physical activity assessments were first obtained in 1986 and updated biennially thereafter.32,33

Prior studies have demonstrated the validity and reproducibility of physical activity data in these cohorts.25,34

With each questionnaire, participants report average weekly time engaged in leisure activities, including walking, jogging, running, bicycling, swimming, calisthenics, rowing, squash, racquet ball and tennis, heavy outdoor work (since 1988), and weight training (since 1990).

This permits calculation of weekly energy expenditure in metabolic equivalent task–hours (MET-hours), using validated approaches (Supplementary Methods).35

PARAGRAPH

Cumulative average updated activity was defined as average weekly time spent engaged in moderate or vigorous physical activity (i.e. requiring ≥3 MET-hours) from all questionnaires up to each 2-year interval, consistent with prior studies.32,33

We also calculated baseline (1986) physical activity.

Physical activity was not assessed in the 1990 NHS questionnaire, therefore we carried these data forward by 1 interval (i.e. we applied 1988 data to the 1990-92 interval).

Otherwise, missing data were not carried forward.

As in prior work,29 covariates were selected a priori (Supplementary Methods).

Incident cirrhosis or viral hepatitis diagnosed during the prior 2-year interval were ascertained from each questionnaire.36

SECTION

Outcomes

PARAGRAPH

Deaths were reported by next-of-kin, the postal authorities or the National Death Index, with >98% follow-up for both cohorts.37,38

For all deaths, we sought death certificates and, when appropriate, requested permission to review medical records, from which the cause of death was confirmed and classified according to ICD-8 codes.

Major surgeries were ascertained and updated with each biennial questionnaire.

The primary endpoint was liver-related mortality, defined as death from HCC or from a non-HCC complication of cirrhosis, consistent with recommendations39 (Supplementary Methods).

As previously described, all HCC cases were confirmed through blinded review of medical records.29

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

To best represent long-term patterns and minimize within-person variation, our primary analysis used cumulative average updated exposures.32,33

To account for potential changes in physical activity after a diagnosis of cirrhosis, we suspended updating of exposures after incident cirrhosis was reported in follow-up.

For the primary analysis, we applied an 8-year latency period, with follow-up beginning in 1994; this permits the assessment of updated exposures, while minimizing potential reverse causation.40

The 8-year period was selected a priori, given the prolonged time that may elapse between the development of cirrhosis and decompensation or death.41

In additional analyses, we used baseline and extended latency exposures (with a lag of 12 years).

BMI was modeled in World Health Organization categories (<19, 19-<25, 25-<30, 30-<35 and ≥35 kg/m2).

Physical activity was categorized in quintiles based upon its distribution, and further in clinically-informative categories (e.g. <3, 3-<9, 9-<18, 18 to <27 and ≥27 MET-hours/week), corresponding to the equivalent of average-pace walking for <1, 1 to <3, 3 to <6, 6 to <9 and ≥9 hours/week.

These categories were selected because walking is readily adoptable and was the most commonly-reported form of exercise, as it is in the broader US population.42

Early adulthood weight change was calculated as the difference between weight in mid-life (1986) and early adulthood weight, and grouped into 5 categories.33

WC and WHR were modeled continuously and in quartiles.

For all models, linear trend was assessed using continuous variables.

PARAGRAPH

Person-time of follow-up accrued from return of the baseline questionnaire to the date of death or end of follow-up (January 31, 2012 [HPFS]; June 1, 2012 [NHS]), whichever came first.

We used Cox proportional hazards regression conditioned on age (years), questionnaire cycle and sex to calculate age- and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% CI for liver-related mortality, accounting for a priori, time-varying covariates (Supplementary Methods).

PARAGRAPH

In stratified models, we assessed the influence of BMI or physical activity according to pre-specified sub-groups, and we tested the significance of interactions using the log likelihood ratio test.

We also compared HCC-specific and cirrhosis/decompensation-specific mortality.

To understand whether physical activity might counteract the excess risk conferred by adiposity, we jointly evaluated physical activity and BMI, as well as physical activity and WC.

Finally, we calculated the population attributable risk conferred by low (<9 MET-hours/week) and very low (<3 MET-hours/week) levels of activity, to estimate the percentage of liver-related deaths that might have been prevented if all participants had engaged in regular physical activity, assuming a causal relationship between factors.43

SECTION

Sensitivity analyses

PARAGRAPH

We tested the robustness of our results in numerous sensitivity analyses.

First, we extended the latency period to 12 years (from 8 years).

Second, because severe underlying disease or obesity may limit exercise, we excluded anyone reporting no baseline physical activity.

Third, because incident viral hepatitis or cirrhosis may represent intermediates that impact both adiposity and exercise,4,19 we constructed separate models further accounting for those factors.

Fourth, we continued updating exposures after the date of diagnosis of cirrhosis.

Fifth, to more completely address the influence of alcohol use on liver-related mortality, we repeated the analysis after excluding anyone with significant alcohol consumption (i.e. ≥1 drink per day among women, or ≥2 drinks/day among men).

In exploratory analyses, we compared resistance training and aerobic activity, and we repeated our primary analysis with liver transplantation included as a competing event.

Finally, in an exploratory analysis, we compared the relative influence of obesity and physical activity on liver-related mortality, among adults with known cirrhosis in 1986 (n = 775), who previously were excluded from the analysis.

PARAGRAPH

All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), with a 2-sided significance p value<0.05.

Results

PARAGRAPH

Overall, we recorded 383 liver-related deaths among 77,238 women and 48,026 men.

Table 1 shows the age-standardized characteristics according to BMI category, in 1986.

Table S1 outlines the corresponding characteristics by physical activity quintile.

After applying the 8-year latency, there were 105,894 individuals (70,810 women; 35,084 men), and 295 liver-related deaths (187 cirrhosis; 108 HCC) over 1,856,226 person-years of follow-up.

SECTION

Total and central adiposity

PARAGRAPH

After multivariable adjustment, each 1-unit increase in cumulative average updated BMI predicted a 5.1% higher risk of liver-related mortality (95% CI 1.03–1.07; ptrend<0.0001).

Compared to normal BMI (19-<25), the aHRs for BMI 25-<30, 30-<35 and ≥35 kg/m2 were 1.40 (95% CI 1.06–1.84), 2.22 (95% CI 1.56–3.16) and 2.97 (95% CI 1.84–4.79), respectively (Table 2).

These findings were similar in men and women (Table S2), and they were consistent across all strata defined by pre-specified risk factors, including age, race/ethnicity, diabetes, alcohol use, smoking and diet (all pinteractions>0.05; Table S3).

Moreover, this strong, positive gradient of risk was similar for HCC-specific and cirrhosis-specific mortality (pheterogeneity= 0.34; Table S4).

PARAGRAPH

To minimize potential reverse causation, we conducted additional analyses using BMI exposures from early adulthood (i.e. age 18 years [women], or 21 years [men]) and from mid-life (in 1986).

Consistent with the primary analysis, higher mid-life BMI predicted significantly increased risk of liver-related mortality in later life (ptrend <0.0001); specifically, compared to mid-life BMI 19-<25, the highest risk was observed with mid-life BMI ≥35 kg/m2 (aHR 2.04, 95% CI 1.34–3.11; Table 2).

These findings remained similar after further accounting for early adulthood BMI (ptrend <0.0001).

Additionally, we observed that a higher early adulthood BMI also was independently associated with increased risk of liver-related mortality (ptrend = 0.0002), even after further adjusting for mid-life BMI (ptrend = 0.0003).

PARAGRAPH

In analyses focused on central adiposity, each 1 cm increase in WC predicted a significantly (5.6%) higher risk of liver-related mortality (95% CI 1.02–1.09; ptrend = 0.003).

Compared to the lowest WC quartile, the aHR in the highest quartile was 2.09 (95% CI 1.16–3.77).

These patterns of association were similar when WHR was used in place of WC (ptrend <0.0001).

SECTION

Physical activity

PARAGRAPH

Overall, every 3 MET-hours/week of exercise – the equivalent of walking at an average pace for 1 hour/week – conferred a 3.5% reduction in risk of liver-related mortality (95% CI 0.95–0.98).

The multivariable aHRs across increasing physical activity quintiles were: 1.0, 0.70 (95% CI 0.51–0.96), 0.59 (95% CI 0.42–0.84), 0.52 (95% CI 0.36–0.74) and 0.46 (95% CI 0.31–0.66), respectively (ptrend <0.0001; Table 2).

This inverse gradient was not materially altered after further accounting for BMI (ptrend = 0.0003), and it was similar when we considered only baseline exposures (ptrend = 0.009).

We observed consistent, inverse associations among both women and men (Table S2), and in analyses comparing HCC-specific and cirrhosis-specific mortality (pheterogeneity=0.42; Table S4).

Our findings also remained similar when physical activity was modeled in clinically relevant categories (i.e. <3, 3-<9, 9-<18, 18-<27 and ≥27 MET-hours/week), corresponding to walking at an average pace for <1, 1 to <3, 3 to <6, 6 to <9 and ≥9 hours per week (ptrend <0.0001; Table S5).

PARAGRAPH

At baseline, 32% of participants had low physical activity (<9 MET-hours/week), and 11% had very low physical activity (<3 MET-hours/week).

Accordingly, we estimated that exercising for at least 3 MET-hours/week or more could have prevented 16% of liver-related deaths (95% CI 0.07–0.26), and exercising for >9 MET-hours/week could have prevented 25% of liver-related deaths (95% CI 0.12–0.38).

SECTION

Joint associations

PARAGRAPH

At all levels of BMI, increasing level of physical activity predicted significantly reduced risk of liver-related mortality (all ptrend<0.0001; Fig. 1).

When examined jointly, the risk was lowest among lean-active adults (BMI <25, physical activity ≥18 MET-hours/week).

Compared to this lean-active group, the highest risk was found among obese-sedentary adults (BMI ≥30; <3 MET-hours/week), who had an aHR of 3.40 (95% CI 2.06–5.56).

Importantly, physical activity appeared to attenuate the excess risk associated with obesity: specifically, the aHRs were 1.04 (95% CI 0.73–1.37) for obese-active adults (BMI ≥30; ≥18 MET-hours/week), and 1.13 (95% CI 0.83–1.52) for obese-moderately active adults (BMI≥30; 9-<18 MET-hours/week).

In contrast, being lean did not fully attenuate the excess risk associated with sedentary behavior: compared to lean-active adults, the aHR among lean-sedentary adults was 2.08 (95% CI 1.21–3.33).

These findings were similar when we used WC in place of BMI (Fig. S1).

SECTION

Early adulthood weight gain

PARAGRAPH

Weight gain between early adulthood and mid-life contributed to significantly higher risk of liver-related mortality in later life (ptrend <0.0001), even after accounting for early adulthood weight (ptrend <0.0001) (Table 3).

Compared to participants with stable weight (+/− 5kg), the highest risk was observed with weight gain ≥15 kg (aHR 1.82; 95% CI 1.32–2.51).

This association was significantly modified by physical activity level: compared to persons with stable weight between early adulthood and mid-life, the aHRs for weight gain ≥15 kg were 1.41 (95% CI 0.79–2.51) for active adults, and 2.19 (95% CI 1.30–3.69) for sedentary adults (pinteraction = 0.014).

These associations were similar for both HCC- and cirrhosis-specific mortality (Table S6).

SECTION

Sensitivity analyses

PARAGRAPH

Our findings were robust across all sensitivity analyses, including: i) after applying a 12-year latency period (Table S7); ii) after excluding any participant who reported no exercise (n = 14,364 excluded; Table S8); iii) after further adjusting for incident viral hepatitis or cirrhosis (Table S9); iv) after continuing to update exposures, after a diagnosis of incident cirrhosis or viral hepatitis (Table S10); and v) after excluding any participant with significant alcohol consumption (i.e. ≥1 drink per day among women, or ≥2 drinks/day among men) (Table S11).

In an exploratory analysis comparing resistance training and aerobic activity, the observed magnitude of benefit appeared similar (Table S12).

Additionally, including liver transplantation as a competing event did not materially impact our results (not shown).

Finally, in an exploratory analysis of adults with underlying cirrhosis in 1986 (n = 775), we observed a similar, significant, inverse association between increasing physical activity level and reduced liver-related mortality risk (ptrend = 0.002).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In 2 prospective cohorts of men and women in the US, low physical activity levels and elevated BMI were each independently associated with increased risk of liver-related mortality, including death from HCC and cirrhosis.

Risk of liver-related mortality was consistently and significantly elevated with obesity in early adulthood, in mid-life, and even with modest weight gain during early adulthood.

However, increased physical activity during adulthood predicted significantly lower risk of liver-related mortality, regardless of BMI.

Importantly, we found that the excess risk conferred by obesity was substantially attenuated among adults who engaged in >9 MET-hours per week of physical activity, the equivalent of walking at an average pace for 3 hours per week or more.

PARAGRAPH

Short-term clinical studies have demonstrated that physical activity is associated with reductions in liver fat, inflammation and insulin resistance;14,15,19,36,44 further, among patients with HCC, therapeutic exercise may increase muscle mass,45 while exercise capacity may predict post-hepatectomy survival.46

However, to date, no large-scale, prospective study has evaluated whether this might translate into improved long-term hepatic outcomes.19

Published epidemiological evidence regarding physical activity and long-term hepatic events derive from just 3 prior studies, that linked higher physical activity levels to reduced incidence of hepatobiliary cancer.9–11

However, those prior studies did not assess liver-related mortality, nor did they include prospectively updated exposures, or account for key clinical and lifestyle factors, including underlying cirrhosis, alcohol use, diet and smoking, which are essential to accurately estimate the long-term effects of physical activity and adiposity on hepatic outcomes.

Specifically, failing to address underlying cirrhosis can lead to reverse causation, because cirrhosis contributes to weight loss and to increased mortality.

In contrast, by excluding individuals with cirrhosis at baseline, and including detailed and updated clinical and lifestyle data over 26 years of follow-up, the current study is able to more precisely characterize the relationships between physical activity, adiposity and liver-related mortality.

PARAGRAPH

We observed strong, inverse associations between increasing physical activity and reduced risk of liver-related mortality, that were consistent regardless of BMI or WC.

Importantly, the excess risk associated with obesity was substantially attenuated in persons who exercised for at least 9 MET-hours/week, the equivalent of average-pace walking for just 3 hours/week.

Given the lack of published data or clinical guidelines regarding the optimal weight or physical activity level required to improve major hepatic outcomes, these findings are both timely and important.

Our data demonstrate for the first time that exercise is an independent, modifiable determinant of long-term hepatic outcomes.

As such, our findings support additional research to identify the optimal type, intensity and duration of physical activity, for incorporation into prevention guidelines.

PARAGRAPH

Several mechanisms might explain the shared effects of exercise and adiposity on liver disease progression and mortality.

Obesity is marked by disproportionately increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT) volume, which promotes fibrosis progression,47,48 while exercise preferentially reduces VAT, even when weight loss is not achieved.36,49,50

Further, exercise interventions can attenuate liver fat and inflammation,14,15,19,36,44 normalize pro-inflammatory biomarkers50,51 and modulate bile acids,52 which may impact the natural history of liver disease.

Finally, because physical activity and obesity may operate on similar inflammatory and carcinogenic pathways, it is possible that a key benefit of physical activity is the minimization of long-term weight gain, over the lifespan.53

Accordingly, it has been recommended that studies examining adiposity and physical activity leverage prospectively updated longitudinal data, to best elucidate these relationships.53

PARAGRAPH

This study is strengthened by the prospective design, large sample size, and by the inclusion of 2 independent cohorts with high rates of follow-up and updated information regarding numerous risk factors for liver-related mortality.

The prospective design minimizes potential recall bias, and any errors in recall would most likely have attenuated rather than exaggerated a true association.

The use of repeated assessments reduces measurement error, while simultaneously addressing real-life changes in adiposity and physical activity patterns over time.

Further, accounting for a range of times between exposure assessment and death minimizes the possibility of reverse causation.

PARAGRAPH

We acknowledge several limitations.

First, we cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding, and we lacked detailed data regarding histological fibrosis stage, non-invasive estimates of fibrosis or adherence to HCC screening guidelines.

However, the observed benefits of physical activity were robust across all sensitivity analyses, after carefully accounting for viral hepatitis and alcohol use, and they were similar in persons with and without underlying cirrhosis.

Second, although reverse causation is possible, we conducted baseline and extended latency analyses in which exposures were assessed many years prior to study outcomes, rendering it highly unlikely that symptoms of undiagnosed liver disease could have biased our results.

Third, we acknowledge that our participants are predominantly white, highlighting the need for future research in more diverse, prospective populations; however, our age- and sex-specific rates of HCC and cirrhosis-specific mortality,39 and our well-validated covariate data,24,25 closely approximate other epidemiological cohorts, supporting the generalizability of our findings.

Fourth, specific types of physical activity may be more beneficial than others, underscoring the need for future studies with detailed, prospectively updated physical activity data and long-term outcomes, to define the optimal type and intensity of physical activity to maximize risk reduction.

Finally, active participants may be more likely to adhere to other healthy behaviors; while our results were similar after carefully accounting for health-promoting factors like diet, alcohol and smoking, future studies are needed that focus on lifestyle overall.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, within 2 prospective cohorts of American adults without established liver disease at enrollment, both low physical activity and obesity were independent predictors of liver-related mortality, including death from cirrhosis and HCC.

Significantly elevated risk was apparent with obesity in early adulthood, in mid-life, and with weight gain during early adulthood.

However, the excess risk conferred by obesity was markedly attenuated by physical activity, and it was no longer statistically significant among adults who engaged in >9 MET-hours per week of physical activity.

These findings demonstrate that physical activity is a major modifiable determinant of long-term hepatic outcomes.

They also support further research to characterize the optimal type and intensity of activity for the prevention of liver-related mortality.
