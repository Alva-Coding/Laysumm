ABSTRACT

TITLE

Safe energy savings through context-aware hot water demand prediction

PARAGRAPH

Tank-style water heaters provide a critical utility but often waste energy, as low temperatures encourage the formation of harmful bacteria.

We develop low-cost hardware to capture training data from a single homeâ€™s hot water consumption and present a system capable of proactively anticipating demand while remaining sensitive to health concerns by combining a flow-predictive autoregressive convolutional neural network with a Cognitive Supervisor for minimizing Legionella formation.

The predictive performance is evaluated for different receptive fields, and the best-performing model successfully tracks water demand one week into the future, providing robust input for the Supervisor to reform Legionella growth with minimal energy expenditure.

First-order estimates find U.S. homeowner savings of $10B in heating costs and 80MMT of CO2 without increased health risks.

This system uniquely combines predictive and protective elements to augment new and incumbent water heater installations including those used in low to middle-high income countries, enhancing global impact.
