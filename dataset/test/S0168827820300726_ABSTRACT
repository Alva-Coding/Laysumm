ABSTRACT

TITLE

Real-world effectiveness and safety of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for the treatment of patients with chronic HCV infection: A meta-analysis

PARAGRAPH

Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is approved for treating adults infected with HCV genotypes 1–6.

In clinical trials, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir was associated with high rates of sustained virologic response at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12) and was well tolerated.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the real-world effectiveness and safety of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir were undertaken.

PARAGRAPH

Real-world studies reporting SVR12 in adults with HCV infection (n ≥20) treated with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir were identified in journal publications from January 1, 2017, to February 25, 2019, and congress presentations through April 14, 2019.

Random-effects meta-analysis was used to determine SVR12 rates using data from ≥2 cohorts; intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses included patients treated with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir who had SVR12 data available, discontinued early, or were lost to follow-up; modified ITT (mITT) analyses excluded those with non-virologic failure.

Naïve pooling was used to calculate adverse event (AE) rates.

PARAGRAPH

Overall, 12,531 adults were treated with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (18 cohorts).

Of patients with post-treatment week 12 data, SVR12 rates were 96.7% (95% CI 95.4–98.1) in the ITT population (n = 8,583, 15 cohorts) and 98.1% (95% CI 97.1–99.2) in the mITT population (n = 7,001, 14 cohorts).

SVR12 rates were ≥95% across subgroups (HCV genotype, cirrhosis status, treatment history, treatment duration, on-label treatment, and subgroups of interest).

AEs were reported in 17.7% (1,271/7,199) of patients (8 cohorts).

Serious AEs were reported in 1.0% (55/5,522) of patients (6 cohorts).

The most frequent AEs were pruritus, fatigue, and headache.

AE-related treatment discontinuations were reported in 0.6% (33/5,595) of patients (6 cohorts).

PARAGRAPH

Consistent with clinical trials, real-world evidence indicates that glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is a well-tolerated and highly effective pangenotypic treatment for a broad range of HCV-infected patients.
