TITLE

HEV superinfection accelerates disease progression in patients with chronic HBV infection and increases mortality in those with cirrhosis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Acute hepatitis E is caused by HEV infection through the fecal-oral route of transmission.1

Every year, an estimated 20 million HEV infections occur globally, resulting in approximately 56,600 deaths.1

Although an HEV vaccine exists, it is used to a limited extent in China and has not yet received World Health Organization approval.2

PARAGRAPH

Though liver damage is inflicted in all cases after HEV infection, most patients are asymptomatic or present non-life-threatening symptoms.

In healthy individuals, occurrence of liver-related death is <2% or even lower, with most patients clearing the infection spontaneously.3

A noticeable exception exists in pregnant women, who are at high risk of developing symptomatic disease and/or liver failure following genotype 1 or 2 infections.4

HEV genotypes 1 and 2 are transmitted through contaminated water and are endemic in southern, central and southeast Asia; Africa; the Middle East; and Mexico.5

In contrast, HEV genotype 3 and 4 infections tend to be clinically silent,3,6 and are transmitted through contaminated animal products in developed regions.

Previous epidemiologic work and the annual report of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) have shown genotype 4 to be the prevalent genotype in Taiwan.7

In general, a consensus on risk factors predisposing individuals to subsequent liver failure and/or liver-related death upon HEV infection remains elusive.

PARAGRAPH

In contrast to acute HEV infection, chronic infection of HBV may take decades to cause disease progression to cirrhosis.8–10

HBV carriers thus usually have varying degrees of liver fibrosis.

It follows logically that patients with chronic HBV may have decreased liver reserve capacity that puts them at greater risk of morbidity and mortality upon HEV infection.

However, previous studies on whether pre-existing chronic liver disease such as chronic HBV infection predispose individuals to acute-on-chronic liver failure following HEV infection have yielded conflicting results.11–13

Additionally, though a study from Hong Kong found that chronic HBV infection was associated with a higher risk of 30-day liver-related mortality in patients with acute HEV infection, all of the patients studied exhibited symptomatic HEV and were therefore less representative of the vast majority of patients with HEV, who are usually asymptomatic; the follow-up period was also relatively short.12

Thus, there is a lack of comprehensive data on the short-term and long-term impact of acute HEV infection on the potentially high-risk group of patients with chronic HBV infection.

PARAGRAPH

Considering the endemicity of chronic HBV infection in Taiwan (overall prevalence was 13.7% in adults) and the risks of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver decompensation in chronically infected individuals,14–17 we aimed to investigate the effects of HEV superinfection on liver-related mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic HBV infection.

SECTION

Materials and methods

SECTION

Patient cohort

PARAGRAPH

This study was divided into 2 parts.

We first analyzed a retrospective cohort of 2,666 patients with chronic hepatitis infection from the “Elucidation of Risk Factors for Disease Control or Advancement in Taiwanese Hepatitis B Carriers” (ERADICATE-B) study.10,15–19

All patients studied were enroled between 1985 and 2000.

None had liver cirrhosis at baseline, and all remained naïve for HBV treatment during the follow-up period.

After excluding 74 patients for whom follow-up serum samples were unavailable, we further excluded another 469 patients (18.1%) with positive HEV-IgG at baseline.

A total of 2,123 patients with seronegative HEV-IgG remained.

PARAGRAPH

For the second part of this study, we enroled 552 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A) at baseline who remained naïve for HBV treatment during the follow-up period.20

A total of 138 patients positive for HEV-IgG at baseline were excluded, and 414 eligible patients remained.

PARAGRAPH

All enroled patients gave informed consent as approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the National Taiwan University Hospital.

SECTION

Diagnosis of HEV superinfection

PARAGRAPH

HEV superinfection was defined as HEV-IgG seroconversion during the follow-up period.

For patients with HEV-IgG seroconversion, HEV RNA, HEV-IgM, and HEV-Ag were also assayed in their serial samples to confirm the diagnosis.

If only HEV-IgG seroconversion was present, (i.e. HEV RNA, HEV-IgM, and HEV-Ag were not detected), at least 2 serum samples had to test positive for HEV-IgG to confirm HEV superinfection.

Time-point of HEV superinfection was defined as the first presence of HEV RNA, HEV-IgM, HEV-Ag or HEV-IgG.

SECTION

Data collection

PARAGRAPH

Patients received serological tests, including HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBe, and anti-HCV, and had liver function tests at baseline.

Throughout the follow-up period, serum liver function tests and alpha-fetoprotein were assayed every 3 to 6 months, and abdominal ultrasonography was performed every 6 months for HCC surveillance.

Serum samples collected at each visit were stored at −20°C until analyzed.

PARAGRAPH

For patients diagnosed with acute HEV infection, information regarding symptoms and liver function beginning 6 months before HEV-IgG seroconversion was extracted from medical records.

SECTION

Diagnosis of cirrhosis, HCC, cirrhosis-related complications, and liver disease mortality

PARAGRAPH

The diagnosis of cirrhosis was based on either histology or ultrasonographic findings plus the clinical features of thrombocytopenia, gastroesophageal varices, or ascites.

Detection of liver cirrhosis by abdominal ultrasonography was scored based on liver parenchyma, liver surface, hepatic vessel, and spleen size.

Cirrhosis diagnoses via ultrasonography required scores of ≥8 on at least 2 ultrasonographic studies more than 6 months apart (specificity >90%).21

Cirrhosis diagnosed via abdominal ultrasound required consistent findings on at least 2 occasions 6 months apart.9

HCC was diagnosed either by histology/cytology or by typical imaging findings (arterial enhancement and venous wash-out by contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scanning) in hepatic nodules larger than 1 cm.22

PARAGRAPH

Cirrhosis-related complications included presence of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic decompensation.8

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was defined as a polymorphonuclear granulocyte count of 250/mm3 or above in ascites with or without a positive bacterial culture.

Variceal bleeding was defined as hematemesis or melena with signs suggestive of esophageal or gastric variceal bleeding during an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in the absence of other lesions that might have caused the bleeding.

PARAGRAPH

Liver-related mortality was defined as death related either to cirrhosis-related complications or HCC.

Mortality data were obtained from medical records and the National Health Death Certification System.8

SECTION

Serological assays

PARAGRAPH

Serum HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBe, and anti-HCV levels were determined by commercial assays (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA).

HEV-IgG, HEV-IgM, and HEV-Ag levels were determined using commercial kits from Wantai, Beijing, China.

SECTION

Quantification of serum HBV DNA, HBsAg and HEV RNA levels

PARAGRAPH

Serum HBV DNA levels were quantified using the Abbott RealTime HBV assay, 0.2 ml protocol (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) with a detection limit of 15 IU/ml.

HBsAg levels were quantified using the Architect HBsAg QT (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.18,23

PARAGRAPH

Serum HEV RNA levels were quantified using in-house real-time PCR.24

Serum RNA was extracted using the QIAamp RNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript® III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen by Life Technologies, Carlsbad, United States).

Primers and probes were designed manually based on HEV genome consensus sequences in the open-reading frame 3 region with a detection limit of 1,000 copies/ml.24

SECTION

Determination of HBV genotype

PARAGRAPH

HBV genotype was determined using a real-time PCR-based single-tube assay as previously described, with a lower detection limit of 20 IU/ml (100 copies/ml).25

For patients with HBV DNA levels lower than the detection limit, we used the IMMUNIS ® HBV Genotype EIA kit (Institute of Immunology Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan), which detects genotype-specific epitopes in the preS2 region, to determine HBV genotypes.25

The detection limit of this assay for HBsAg is approximately 100 IU/ml.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

We defined liver-related mortality and HCC as the primary and secondary endpoints, respectively.

Clinical follow-up began at the time of enrolment in the study.

Person-years were censored on the date each endpoint occurred or on the last date of follow-up/available serum sample, whichever came first.

Because the Taiwanese government began reimbursing indefinite antiviral treatment for cirrhotic patients in 2011, follow-up of all cirrhotic patients was censored on Dec 31st, 2010.

The cumulative incidence of each endpoint was derived using Kaplan-Meier curve analysis, and statistical differences were calculated using the log-rank test.

PARAGRAPH

We defined HEV exposure as a time-dependent variable.

The person-years of the patient with acute HEV infection were split into 2 parts: the pre-infection duration, or non-exposure to HEV infection; and the post-infection duration, or post-exposure to HEV infection.

PARAGRAPH

Mean and SD were calculated for continuous variables, and percentages were used for categorical variables.

We defined HEV exposure as a time-dependent co-variate and the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate the crude and multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of each endpoint.

According to a validated HCC prediction model, age, sex, and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), HBeAg, and HBV DNA levels were included as adjusting variables.26

PARAGRAPH

Statistical significance of all tests was defined as p <0.05 by 2-tailed tests.

All analyses were performed using Stata (version 10.0; Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA).

Results

SECTION

Baseline characteristics and follow-up results

PARAGRAPH

Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the 2,123 patients who did not have evidence of cirrhosis or HEV exposure at baseline.

Of these patients, 1,263 (59.5%) were male, 618 (29.1%) had ALT level ≥40 U/L, 434 (20.4%) were HBeAg positive, and 814 (38.3%) had high viral loads (HBV DNA level ≥20,000 IU/ml).

PARAGRAPH

During the follow-up period, 38, 126, 218 patients developed liver-related death, HCC, and cirrhosis at annual incidence rates of 0.11% (95% CI 0.08–0.15%), 0.38% (95% CI 0.32–0.45%), and 0.67% (95% CI 0.59–0.77%) respectively Table S2.

SECTION

Patients with HEV superinfection: incidence, baseline characteristics, and clinical presentations

PARAGRAPH

Forty-six patients developed HEV superinfection during follow-up with an annual incidence of 0.18% (95% CI 0.13–0.24%).

Cumulative incidence of HEV superinfection is shown in Fig. 1A. Most patients were asymptomatic, with only 15.2% (n = 7) exhibiting elevated ALT levels and 7.0% (n = 3) hospitalised due to icteric hepatitis or liver failure (Table S1).

No obvious neurological manifestations were recorded in the medical information.

Though HEV-Ag was initially detected in 9 patients, HEV-Ag levels were undetectable a year later in available serum samples, suggesting that the virus was cleared.

PARAGRAPH

Baseline characteristics were comparable between patients with and without the development of HEV superinfection during the follow-up period (Table 1).

The number of the patients developing liver-related death, HCC, and cirrhosis in those with and without HEV superinfection is summarized in Table S1.

SECTION

HEV superinfection associated with a higher risk of liver-related death

PARAGRAPH

We adopted the Cox regression model to explore whether HEV superinfection is associated with the development of 2 endpoints by defining HEV superinfection as a time-dependent variable.

Using univariable analysis, we found that HEV superinfection was highly associated with increased liver-related mortality (HR 6.02; 95% CI 1.84–19.72), but not development of HCC and cirrhosis.

Multivariable analysis after adjustment for age, sex, ALT, HBeAg, and HBV DNA showed that HEV superinfection remained an independent risk factor for liver-related death, with an HR of 5.78 (95% CI 1.74–19.20) (Table 2).

SECTION

HEV superinfection associated with a higher risk of disease progression in HBeAg-negative patients with chronic HBV infection

PARAGRAPH

Since the risks of HBV-related disease progression varied among the patients with heterogenous characteristics, we restricted the study population to 723 HBeAg-negative patients with chronic HBV infection, who had HBV DNA level <2,000 IU/ml and ALT <40 U/L at baseline.27

In these patients with limited risk of HBV-related liver disease progression, 16 exhibited HEV superinfection during the follow-up period.

In addition to being a risk factor for liver-related death, HEV superinfection was also associated with higher risks of development of HCC and cirrhosis using uni- and multivariable analysis (Table S3).

SECTION

Development of cirrhosis before HEV superinfection was associated with short-term liver-related death

PARAGRAPH

Because we found acute HEV infection to be a major risk factor for liver-related death in patients with chronic HBV infection, we studied the time from HEV superinfection to liver-related death.

Among the 4 patients who died after HEV superinfection, 3 died of liver failure within 1 year.

This rapidity of disease progression suggested that the increased incidence of liver-related death we found may have been due to reduced liver reserve.

As all the patients did not have cirrhosis at baseline in our first cohort study, we investigated whether the emergence of cirrhosis before HEV superinfection was associated with liver-related death.

PARAGRAPH

Among the 46 patients with HEV superinfection, 4 patients had compensated liver cirrhosis before HEV superinfection (average interval from diagnosis of cirrhosis to HEV superinfection was 4.7 years).

When stratifying the cumulative incidence of liver-related death by liver cirrhosis status before HEV superinfection, pre-existing cirrhosis was shown to be strongly associated with liver-related death (Fig. 1B, p = 0.001): the 1-year mortality rate was 50% for the patients who developed cirrhosis before HEV superinfection, compared to 2.4% (only 1 liver-related death) in those who remained non-cirrhotic before HEV superinfection.

After adjustment for sex and age at HEV infection, the HR of pre-existing cirrhosis was 13.8 (95% CI 1.2–163.6).

SECTION

Validation in an independent cohort of patients with CHB and cirrhosis at baseline

PARAGRAPH

To validate the impact of HEV and to rule out the alternative hypothesis that the high mortality rate of the patients who had cirrhosis was simply due to the additional morbidity risk posed by cirrhosis, we studied a cohort of 414 patients with CHB who had Child-Pugh A cirrhosis at enrolment (clinical presentation depicted in Table S1).

During a mean follow-up period of 11.8 years, 10 patients developed HEV superinfection with an annual incidence of 0.21% (95% CI 0.11–0.39%).

PARAGRAPH

By defining acute HEV infection as a time-dependent variable, we consistently found HEV infection to be associated with a higher risk of developing liver-related death (HR 7.32; 95% CI 2.79–19.18), but not HCC (Table 3).

HEV superinfection remained an independent risk factor for liver-related death (HR 5.02; 95% CI 1.87–13.51), even after adjustment for the baseline factors of age, sex, and ALT, HBeAg, and HBV DNA levels (Table 3).

PARAGRAPH

To determine whether acute HEV infection was associated with a higher short-term mortality rate, we compared the cumulative liver-related mortality rate between cirrhosis patients with and without acute HEV infection.

In this analysis, follow-up began at baseline for non-infected patients and at HEV superinfection for infected patients.

Compared to 0% in non-infected patients, the 1-year mortality rate for infected patients was as high as 30% (Fig. 2A).

SECTION

The overall liver-related mortality rate in patients with CHB and cirrhosis

PARAGRAPH

To more accurately estimate the risk of liver-related death in patients with pre-existing cirrhosis, we merged the data from 4 patients with HEV from the first cohort who had no cirrhosis at baseline but developed cirrhosis during the follow-up and 10 patients with HEV from the second cohort with cirrhosis at baseline.

Of these 14 patients, 8 died of a liver-related cause.

Five events occurred within 1 year after HEV-IgG seroconversion, leading to a 1-year liver-related mortality rate of 35.7% (Fig. 2B).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this study, we investigated the clinical outcomes of Taiwanese patients with HBV following HEV superinfection in a retrospective cohort study of patients who were susceptible to HEV infection at the time of enrolment.

We initially explored whether HEV superinfection during the follow-up period adversely affects short-term and long-term liver outcomes, including cirrhosis, HCC, and liver-related death, and their risk factors.

Our research was the first study to show that, while relatively harmless in healthy individuals, acute HEV infection was associated with an increased risk of liver-related death in patients with chronic HBV infection.

When restricted to HBeAg-negative patients with chronic HBV infection, despite low event frequency, HEV superinfection was shown to be a risk factor for all 3 endpoints.

Subgroup analysis showed that liver-related death occurred mostly in patients who developed cirrhosis before HEV infection.

These findings were validated in an independent cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis at baseline.

The combined 1-year liver-related mortality rate across both cohorts was 35.7% for the 14 patients with CHB who already had cirrhosis before HEV superinfection.

This statistic is comparable to the high mortality rate of HEV-infected pregnant women (estimates given by previous studies in the field range from 15% to 25%),4 and significantly higher than that of the general population (1–2%).

PARAGRAPH

Acute HEV infection is an emerging disease, and risk factors predisposing infected individuals to liver-related death and other serious complications remain unknown.

The best way to prevent virus infection is active immunization via vaccination.

As of now, an HEV vaccine is available in China,3 but has not yet passed World Health Organization phase IV clinical observations and remains unapproved for use in at-risk areas.1

The safety and cost of the vaccine as well as the burden of the disease are 3 important issues that need to be addressed when considering global vaccination.

If global vaccination is not feasible, vaccination of high-risk groups poses an attractive alternative.

As our data shows that cirrhosis was highly associated with liver-related death in patients with CHB who develop acute HEV infection, we recommend exploration of the efficacy of HEV vaccination in patients with CHB and cirrhosis.

PARAGRAPH

Acute hepatitis E causes liver damage within a short period of infection duration.1

We initially hypothesized that this transient but severe liver damage may increase liver-related mortality rate and accelerate fibrosis progression, which further increases the risk of long-term cirrhosis and HCC development.

Data from both cohort studies suggest that short-term mortality increased significantly after acute HEV infection, especially for cirrhotic patients.

We did not identify increased risk for cirrhosis or HCC after HEV superinfection when analyzing the heterogeneous overall cohort.

However, subgroup analysis showed that patients with HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection or inactive carrier state, who are recognized to have a lower risk of HBV-driven disease progression,10,15,28 had significantly worse outcomes after HEV superinfection.

Although this finding supports our hypothesis, there were only a few events in these low-risk patients, leading to a wide CI of 95%.

Future studies are needed to confirm these findings.

PARAGRAPH

Our study design differed from that of previous studies in several ways.

Firstly, previous studies enroled symptomatic HEV-infected patients only and had a relatively short-term follow-up.11–13

The exclusion of non-symptomatic patients skewed these studies towards over-estimating HEV-related hazards and did not accurately represent the clinical courses of most patients, who are asymptomatic or subclinical.

Furthermore, the brevity of the follow-up period rendered evaluation of the long-term outcomes of the HBV carriers difficult.12

In contrast, the large-scale cohort approach of our study allowed unbiased evaluation of different outcomes.

Also, given the essential role of several host and HBV viral factors (e.g. HBeAg and HBV DNA) in disease progression in treatment-naïve patients,26 inclusion of these common HBV factors is necessary to accurately predict liver-related outcomes.

The impact of HEV superinfection on patients with HBV can only be well addressed when both host and viral factors are comprehensively analyzed.

PARAGRAPH

Moreover, though a previous study by Acharya et al. showed an association between cirrhosis and liver-related death after HEV infection,29 this study from India enroled mostly patients infected with HEV genotype 1 virus.

Our study focused on patients infected with HEV genotype 4, which is not only prevalent and relevant to Taiwan,7 but has also overtaken HEV genotype 1 as the leading cause of HEV infection over the past decades in other parts of Asia.1

In addition, because most HEV-infected patients studied by Acharya et al. had worse liver reserve (average Child-Pugh score = 10) than our patients at enrolment,29 poor liver reserve remained a significant confounding factor; it is unclear whether the observed increase in incidence of liver-related death should be attributed to HEV infection or poor liver reserve.

Because our longitudinal study ensured none of the patients had hepatic decompensation before HEV infection, we eliminate this confounder.

Overall, though our patient characteristics differ from those of Acharya et al., our findings are consistent with theirs, providing additional support for the severe impact of HEV superinfection on patients with CHB and cirrhosis.

PARAGRAPH

Our study was not without limitations.

First, among all 56 HEV-infected patients from both cohorts, we were unable to detect early indicators of HEV infection in 80% of the patients; in these cases, we confirmed the diagnosis of HEV infection if and only if 2 independent serum samples tested positive for HEV-IgG.

Because our retrospective cohort study only collected serum samples every 3 to 6 months (mostly every 6 months), the samples collected from HEV-positive patients did not necessarily contain HEV-IgM, HEV RNA or HEV-Ag, which present only transiently at the early stages of acute HEV infection.

Furthermore, samples were stored at −20°C, which may cause the degradation of HEV RNA; thus, HEV genotype data was not readily available.

In contrast, HEV-IgG becomes detectable soon after the presence of HEV-IgM, and persists for decades and sometimes even for life.

For these reasons, we believe HEV-IgG is a more appropriate biomarker for a large-scale cohort study and used it as a confirmation of HEV infection when early indicators were absent.

The second limitation is that we were only able to evaluate HEV-related symptoms or abnormal liver function every 3 to 6 months when the patients visited the clinic for follow-up.

Although we may have missed some minor symptoms, this flaw does not bias the solid endpoints, such as liver-related death, HCC, and cirrhosis.

Thirdly, we enroled only treatment-naïve patients in both cohort studies; more data is needed to validate the role of HEV superinfection in patients who are receiving antiviral therapy.

Lastly, because cirrhosis serves as a major risk factor not only for HEV-related mortality but also for HCC development, HEV-induced high mortality could be a competing risk for HCC development.

This informative censoring may undermine efforts to delineate the relationship between HEV infection and HCC development in patients with CHB.

PARAGRAPH

In summary, the annual incidence of HEV infection was 0.2% in Taiwanese patients with chronic HBV infection.

HEV superinfection was associated with an increased risk of liver-related death that was more pronounced in patients with existing cirrhosis prior to HEV superinfection (1-year mortality rate of 35.7%).

In the subgroup of HBeAg-negative patients with chronic HBV infection, HEV superinfection was associated with increased risks of disease progression.

These data highlight the importance of HEV prevention, especially in patients with poor liver reserve.
