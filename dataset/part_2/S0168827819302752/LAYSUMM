TITLE

Declining hepatitis C virus-related liver disease burden in the direct-acting antiviral therapy era in New South Wales, Australia

PARAGRAPH

Rising hepatitis C-related morbidity and mortality is a major public health issue.

However, development of highly effective medicines against hepatitis C (called direct-acting antivirals or DAAs) means hepatitis C could be eliminated as a public health threat by 2030.

This study shows a sharp decline in liver disease morbidity and mortality since the introduction of DAAs in New South Wales, Australia.

Despite this, heavy alcohol use remains an important risk factor for liver disease among people with hepatitis C. To ensure that the benefits of new antiviral treatments are not compromised, management of major comorbidities, including heavy alcohol use must improve among people with hepatitis C.
