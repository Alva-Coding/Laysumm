TITLE

Magnetic resonance cholangiogram patterns and clinical profiles of ketamine-related cholangiopathy in drug users

PARAGRAPH

Recreational inhalation of ketamine is currently an important substance abuse issue worldwide, and can result in anomalies of the biliary system as demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging.

Although prolonged exposure may lead to further clinical deterioration, such biliary system anomalies might be reversible after ketamine abstinence.
