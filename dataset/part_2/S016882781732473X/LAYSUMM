TITLE

Type I interferon receptor signaling delays Kupffer cell replenishment during acute fulminant viral hepatitis

PARAGRAPH

Viral infection can cause fulminant hepatitis, which in turn is a major cause of acute liver failure.

Herein, we aimed to study the role of type 1 interferon responses in acute viral hepatitis.

We identified that during infection with DNA-encoded viruses, type 1 interferon receptor triggering of blood monocytes delays the development of monocyte-derived Kupffer cells.

This points to new therapeutic strategies for acute viral hepatitis.
