TITLE

Immunogenomic landscape of hepatocellular carcinoma with immune cell stroma and EBV-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinomas with histologic evidence of abundant immune cell infiltration are characterized by frequent activation of Epstein-Barr virus in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and less aggressive clinical behavior.

However, a high density of Epstein-Barr virus-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is associated with inferior prognostic outcomes, possibly as a result of immune escape due to significant CD8 T cell exhaustion
