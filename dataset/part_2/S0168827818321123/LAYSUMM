TITLE

Assessing the cost-effectiveness of hepatitis C screening strategies in France

PARAGRAPH

In the context of highly effective and well tolerated therapies for hepatitis C virus that are now recommended for all patients, a reassessment of hepatitis C screening strategies is needed.

An effectiveness and cost-effectiveness study of different strategies targeting either the at-risk population, specific ages or all individuals was performed.

In France, universal screening is the most effective strategy and is cost-effective when treatment is initiated regardless of fibrosis stage.

From an individual and especially from a societal perspective of hepatitis C virus eradication, this strategy should be implemented.
