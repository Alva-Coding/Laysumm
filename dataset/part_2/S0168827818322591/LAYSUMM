Liver transplantation in patients with multiple organ failures: Feasibility and outcomes

PARAGRAPH

Multiple organ failures, ranging from 1–6, are common in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis.

The survival without liver transplant is dismal in the presence of three or more organ failures.

Small retrospective studies have shown that liver transplant is feasible with good outcomes even in the presence of multiple organ failures.

In this study, using a large national dataset, we show that survival chances for more than 30 days in those with three or more organ failures are less than 8%.

However, if a liver transplant is performed quickly, the survival chances are very high with one-year survival ranging from 84% with three organ failures to 81% with 5–6 organ failures.
