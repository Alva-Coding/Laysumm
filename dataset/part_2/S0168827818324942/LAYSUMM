TITLE

Association between rapid utilisation of direct hepatitis C antivirals and decline in the prevalence of viremia among people who inject drugs in Australia

PARAGRAPH

The World Health Organizationâ€™s goal to reduce hepatitis C virus incidence by 80% will be difficult to achieve without widespread scale up and a corresponding reduction in viraemic prevalence among those most at risk of onward transmission.

Our results indicate that a population-level reduction in viraemic prevalence is achievable through high levels of treatment and cure among people who inject drugs.
