ABSTRACT

TITLE

BAP1 mutations define a homogeneous subgroup of hepatocellular carcinoma with fibrolamellar-like features and activated PKA

PARAGRAPH

DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion is a specific driver event in fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC), a rare subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurring in adolescents and young adults.

In older patients, molecular determinants of HCC with mixed histological features of HCC and FLC (mixed-FLC/HCC) remain to be discovered.

PARAGRAPH

A series of 151 liver tumors including 126 HCC, 15 FLC, and 10 mixed-FLC/HCC were analyzed by RNAseq and whole-genome- or whole-exome-sequencing.

Western-blots were performed to validate genomics discoveries.

Results were validated using the TCGA database.

PARAGRAPH

Most of the mixed-FLC/HCC RNAseq clustered in a robust subgroup of 17 tumors all showing mutation or translocation inactivating BAP1 that codes for the BRCA1 associated protein-1.

Similar to FLC, BAP1-HCC were significantly enriched in female, tumor fibrosis and the lack of chronic liver disease when compared to non-BAP1-HCC.

However, patients were older and with a poorer prognosis than FLC patients.

BAP1 tumors were immune hot, showed progenitor features, did not show DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion and were almost all non-mutated for CTNNB1, TP53 and TERT promoter.

In contrast, 80% of the BAP1 tumors showed a chromosome gain of PRKACA at 19p13, combined with a loss of PRKAR2A (coding for the inhibitory regulatory subunit of PKA) at 3p21, leading to a high PRKACA/PRKAR2A ratio at the mRNA and protein levels.

PARAGRAPH

We have characterized a subgroup of BAP1-driven HCC bearing fibrolamellar-like features and a dysregulation of the PKA pathway, which could be at the root of the clinical and histological similarities between BAP1 tumors and DNAJB1-PRKACA FLCs.
