TITLE

BAP1 mutations define a homogeneous subgroup of hepatocellular carcinoma with fibrolamellar-like features and activated PKA

PARAGRAPH

Herein, we have defined a homogeneous subgroup of hepatocellular carcinomas in which the BAP1 gene is inactivated.

This leads to the development of cancers with features similar to those of fibrolamellar carcinoma.

These tumors more frequently develop in females without chronic liver disease or cirrhosis.

The presence of PKA activation and T cell infiltrates suggest that these tumors could be treated with PKA inhibitors or immunomodulators.
