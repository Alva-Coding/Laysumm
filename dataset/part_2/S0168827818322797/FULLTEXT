TITLE

No impact of resistance-associated substitutions on the efficacy of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and voxilaprevir for 12 weeks in HCV DAA-experienced patients

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Chronic hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) is a global health problem causing death and morbidity.1

Recent studies have shown that the global prevalence of HCV is estimated to be 1% in 2015, corresponding to 71.1 million individuals with chronic HCV infection.2,3

The disease burden of HCV infection is due to progression of chronic liver disease, which can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and death.

Globally, 27% of all cases of cirrhosis and 25% of all HCC is attributable to HCV infection.4

With the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), highly effective regimens with sustained virologic response (SVR) rates of >90% are now available for most patients with HCV infection.5–7

Despite high SVR rates following DAA treatment in both clinical trials and “real-world” cohorts, there is a growing population of patients who fail DAA-based therapies and have limited approved retreatment options.8–13

These patients, who represent the majority of recent treatment failures, are of particular concern because the resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) that are selected by NS5A inhibitors maintain viral fitness long after the end of the failed treatment.14,15

It has been shown that patients with genotype 1 (GT1) HCV infection who failed 8 or 12 weeks of treatment with the fixed dose combination of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) and were retreated with LDV/SOF for 24 weeks had an SVR rate of 71%.16

Patients who failed treatment with SOF and VEL, and were retreated with SOF/VEL+ribavirin for 24 weeks had an overall SVR rate of 91%, with an SVR rate of 76% for a subset of patients with GT3 HCV infection.17

PARAGRAPH

The fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX) was developed to address the medical need for retreatment options for DAA-experienced patients.

Resistance to SOF is conferred by the S282T substitution in NS5B.18

S282T was first described as a major RAS for other nucleotide inhibitors (NIs).19

A comprehensive analysis of all substitutions in NS5B among SOF-treated patients in the phase II and III studies identified two additional treatment-selected substitutions, L159F and V321A, using deep sequencing.20

Velpatasvir, both in vitro and in vivo, selected HCV replicon variants with mutations at positions 24, 28, 31, 32, 92, and 93 in NS5A across GTs 1–6.

In the GT1a replicon, the NS5A RASs Q30L/R/H, Y93F demonstrated no resistance (≤2.5-fold change) to VEL and Q30K/E, L31I/M/V, P32L, H58D, and Y93C/S) demonstrated low- to mid-level resistance (2.5- to 100-fold change); high levels of resistance (>100-fold change) were observed in Y93H/N/R/W and double mutants.

In the GT1b replicon, all NS5A RASs conferred <10-fold change to VEL, except A92K.

The majority of the GT2a, GT3a, and GT4a single mutants displayed no or low levels of resistance to VEL; however, Y93H in GT3a conferred 723.5-fold reduced susceptibility to VEL.21

PARAGRAPH

Amino acid changes in NS3 positions R155 and A156 were signature mutations for the first-generation NS3/4A protease inhibitors (PIs), telaprevir and boceprevir.

Second-generation PIs including the macrocyclic PIs simeprevir and asunaprevir, have similar resistance profiles to the first-generation PIs and in addition select mutations at position D168.22–24

The third-generation PI grazoprevir has decreased interactions with R155 wherein it retains activity against R155K.25,26

Voxilaprevir (VOX; GS-9857) is a pan-genotypic HCV NS3/4A PI with potent antiviral activity across all HCV GTs and an improved resistance profile compared with first and second-generation PIs.27

Voxilaprevir demonstrated improved activity against clinically significant GT1 RASs including Q80K, R155K, D168A and D168E.27

PARAGRAPH

In a phase Ib study of VOX monotherapy, most patients (74%) did not develop NS3 selected RASs, and no RASs were selected in patients with GT2 or 4.

A156T and A156V were the most common selected substitutions that were no longer detectable at 12 weeks post-treatment in subjects with GT1a or 1b.28

Previously, it has been shown that most patients treated with other macrocyclic NS3/4A PIs, including vaniprevir, danoprevir, paritaprevir, and simeprevir selected substitutions at positions R155 and D168 in GT1a and GT1b patients, respectively.29–32

These variants were rarely selected by VOX, consistent with the no or low-level resistance in replicon assays.

PARAGRAPH

In phase III studies SOF/VEL/VOX administered for 12 weeks to DAA-experienced patients led to an SVR12 rate of 96% in NS5A inhibitor-experienced patients in POLARIS-1, and an SVR12 rate of 98% in DAA-experienced patients who had not previously received an NS5A inhibitor in POLARIS-4.33

Recently, SOF/VEL/VOX has received regulatory approval as a salvage regimen for DAA-experienced patients in the US and EU.34,35

PARAGRAPH

This report describes the relationship between the presence of detectable RASs at baseline and treatment outcome and the selection of RASs in patients who experienced virologic failure in the POLARIS-1 and -4 studies.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Ethics statement

PARAGRAPH

All studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and local regulatory requirements.

All patients provided written informed consent.

SECTION

Study design

PARAGRAPH

Detailed descriptions of POLARIS-1 (n = 263, NCT02607735), and POLARIS-4 (n = 182, NCT02639247) have been published33 and are described briefly below.

PARAGRAPH

In POLARIS-1, patients with HCV GT1 infection were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive SOF/VEL/VOX (400 mg of sofosbuvir, 100 mg of velpatasvir, and 100 mg of voxilaprevir) or matched placebo for 12 weeks.

All patients who were infected with HCV of other GTs or an indeterminate GT, regardless of whether they had cirrhosis, were enrolled in the SOF/VEL/VOX group.

Patients who were randomly assigned to the placebo group were eligible for 12 weeks of subsequent treatment with SOF/VEL/VOX.

This report describes the analysis for only the first group who received SOF/VEL/VOX (n = 263).

Within this group, 51% had prior exposure to LDV, 27% had prior exposure to daclatasvir and 11% had prior exposure to ombitasvir.

The prior NS5A inhibitors for the remaining 13% included VEL, and elbasvir.

PARAGRAPH

In POLARIS-4, patients with HCV GT1, 2, or 3 infection were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SOF/VEL/VOX or SOF/VEL once daily for 12 weeks.

Patients who were infected with HCV of any other GT were assigned to receive SOF/VEL/VOX for 12 weeks.

This report only describes the analysis for the patients who received SOF/VEL/VOX (n = 182).

Within this group 69% of patients had prior exposure to SOF (primarily SOF+ribavirin and SOF+pegylated-interferon+ribavirin) and 11% of patients had prior SOF+simeprevir.

The prior DAAs for the remaining 20% included mericitabine, deleobuvir+faldaprevir, mericitabine+danoprevir, and SOF+telaprevir.

SECTION

Laboratory assessments

PARAGRAPH

HCV RNA was determined at a central laboratory using the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV Quantitative Test, version 2.0 (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Pleasanton, CA) with a lower limit of quantitation of 15 IU/ml.

HCV GT was determined using the Abbott RealTime HCV GT II assay at screening.

HCV GT and subtype were subsequently determined by analysis of NS3, NS5A, and NS5B sequences with the use of Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST); these results were used in the analyses.

SECTION

Sequencing analyses

PARAGRAPH

Resistance testing was performed on available baseline plasma samples with HCV RNA ≥1,000 IU/ml.

Deep sequencing of the NS3, NS5A, and NS5B genes was performed at baseline for all patients in POLARIS-1 (263 patients) and POLARIS-4 (182 patients) and at the time of failure for patients who did not achieve SVR12 because of virologic failure.

The SVR12 resistance analysis included only patients with both NS3 and NS5A or NS5B baseline sequences, and known virologic outcome and excluded patients with the virologic outcome of “other” (six patients who did not have a post-treatment week 12 assessment because of loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent or death).

In POLARIS-1, 248 patients randomized/enrolled into SOF/VEL/VOX 12-week group and had both NS3 and NS5A data available for baseline analysis.

In POLARIS-4, 169 patients in the SOF/VEL/VOX 12-week group both NS3 and NS5A sequencing data available and were included in the SVR12 resistance analysis.

NS5B sequencing data were available for 258 and 176 patients that were included in the NS5B resistance analysis for POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

Deep sequencing was performed by DDL Diagnostic Laboratory (Rijswijk, The Netherlands) using Illumina MiSeq deep sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA).

Internally developed software (Gilead Sciences) was used to process and align sequencing data to identify the substitutions present at RAS positions using 15% cut-offs.

The presence of baseline RASs was established by comparison with wild-type reference sequences (H77 AF009606 for GT1a, Con1 AJ238799 for GT1b, JFH1 AB047639 for GT2a, MD2b10 AY232748 for GT2b, S52 GU814263 for GT3a, ED43 GU814265 for GT4a, SA13 AF064490 for GT5a, EUHK2 Y12083 for GT6a).

PARAGRAPH

RASs were defined as specific substitutions that either confer a reduced susceptibility to drugs of the given class with a >2.5-fold change in half maximal effective concentration (EC50) compared with a GT specific reference in a replicon model, or that commonly select in patients with virologic failure at the time of relapse.

For this report, RASs are presented using 15% assay cut-offs, comparable to the sensitivity of Sanger sequencing and consistent with the recent move in the field to focus on the clinically meaningful threshold.36–38

NS3 and NS5A RASs that meet these criteria are listed (Table S2).

VOX- and VEL-specific RASs are specific substitutions in the NS3 protease or NS5A gene that confer >2.5-fold reduced susceptibility to VOX or VEL, respectively, in vitro.

Single and double NS5A RASs were classified further by the level of reduced susceptibility to VEL (<2.5-fold, 2.5–100-fold, and >100-fold change; Table S3).

PARAGRAPH

NS5B nucleoside inhibitor (NI) RASs were defined as substitutions that confer >2.5-fold reduced susceptibility to NS5B NIs in vitro in ≥1 GT or treatment-selected substitutions in patients who failed on SOF-based regimens (S96T, N142T, L159F, E/N237G, S282any, C/F/M289I/L, L320F/I/V, and V321A/I).

SECTION

Drug susceptibility analyses

PARAGRAPH

Resistance mutations were introduced into the GT1a (H77), GT3a (S52), and GT4a (ED43), by site-directed mutagenesis and tested in transient transfections as previously described.39

Replicon RNAs were transcribed in vitro from replicon-encoding plasmids using a MEGAscript kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).

RNA was transfected into Huh-lunet cells as previously described.40

Compounds were diluted in 100% DMSO and added to cells.

Cells were treated for three days, after which culture media were removed, cells were lysed, and Renilla luciferase activity was quantified using a commercially available assay (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Top Count instrument (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA).

EC50 values were calculated as the compound concentration at which a 50% reduction in the level of Renilla reporter activity was observed when compared with control samples with DMSO.

Dose-response curves and EC50 values were generated using GraphPad Prism software package (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) by nonlinear regression analysis.

Results

SECTION

Prevalence of baseline NS3 and NS5A RASs

PARAGRAPH

The GT and subtype determined by the Abbott RealTime assay and sequencing-based BLAST analysis for patients from POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4 are summarized (Table S1).

Of the 445 patients in POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4, 5 patients (1.1%) were mis-genotyped, 28 patients (6.3%) were unable to be genotyped and 220 (49.4%) had their genotype determined by the sequencing-based BLAST analysis due to the inability to identify subtypes using the Abbott assay.

Overall, the resistance analysis included 217 (52.0%) patients with GT1, 31 (7.4%) patients with GT2, 123 (29.5%) patients with GT3 and 46 (11.0%) patients with GT4-6.

PARAGRAPH

In POLARIS-1, 82.7% (205 of 248), had baseline NS3 and/or NS5A RASs (Fig. 1A).

Of these, 196 patients had baseline NS5A RASs, the most common class of RASs across GTs.

In POLARIS-4, 49.1% of patients (83 of 169) had baseline NS3 and/or NS5A RASs (Fig. 1B).

Overall, in both studies, 69.1% (288 of 417) had baseline NS3 and/or NS5A RASs and the majority of the patients had NS5A RASs (57.6%, 240 of 417, Fig. 1C).

PARAGRAPH

Among patients with GT1 HCV infection, 80.6% (175 of 217) had baseline NS3 and/or NS5A RASs (Table 1).

NS3 RASs were the most common RASs in patients with GT1 HCV infection (53.4%) primarily because of the high prevalence of Q80K in the patients with GT1a HCV infection.

NS5A RASs were the most prevalent RASs in patients with GT2, 3, or 4–6 HCV infections.

The most prevalent NS5A RASs in patients with GT4 HCV infection were L30R (10 of 28, 35.7%) and L28M/V+L30H/R (9 of 28, 32.1%).

All six patients with GT 6 HCV infection had RASs at position 28 (F28V/M).

SECTION

Impact of NS3 and NS5A baseline RASs on treatment response in DAA-experienced patients using a 15% assay cut-off

PARAGRAPH

In both POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4, the presence of baseline RASs did not affect the overall SVR12 rate (Fig. 1A, B, C); as such, the data from these studies are pooled for resistance analyses described herein, except where noted.

The SVR12 rates were ≥96.8% for patients with NS3 and/or NS5A RASs, and ≥97.7% for patients without RASs (Figs. 1C, 2A).

The presence of baseline RASs did not impact the SVR12 rate when assessed by genotype (Fig. 2B).

Additionally, for patients with GT3 and NS5A RASs, 93.2% (41 of 44) and 100% (9 of 9) of patients achieved SVR12 in POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4, respectively (data not shown).

SECTION

Impact of individual and multiple NS3 and NS5A baseline RASs on treatment response in DAA-experienced patients

PARAGRAPH

The number of baseline NS3 and/or NS5A RASs did not affect the SVR12 for DAA-experienced patients treated with SOF/VEL/VOX for 12 weeks, despite the relatively high number of patients with multiple RASs (Fig. 3A).

PARAGRAPH

Single or multiple NS3 RASs that have been associated with resistance to earlier generation PIs were selected for additional baseline analysis.

While numbers in any particular group are generally small, no specific mutations had a significant effect on treatment outcome following 12 weeks of SOF/VEL/VOX with SVR12 rates ≥95.1% in all groups (Fig. 3B, Table 2).

The most common NS3 RAS observed was Q80K, alone or in combination with other NS3 RASs, in 17.7% of patients (74 of 417).

Of those, 97.3% (72 of 74) achieved SVR12.

A156G was observed in only one patient, who achieved SVR12.

Other NS3 RASs which have been shown to confer moderate to high levels of resistance to most approved NS3/4A PIs were observed at low prevalence: R155 variants at 1.0% and D168 variants at 4.6%.

All patients who had these RASs at baseline achieved SVR12.

PARAGRAPH

NS5A RASs at the four positions 28, 30, 31, and 93 were more common among NS5A inhibitor-experienced patients.

In POLARIS-1, 13.7%, 35.1%, 21.4%, and 39.1% of patients had NS5A RASs at positions 28, 30, 31, and 93, respectively.

In POLARIS-4, 3.0%, 8.9%, 14.2%, and 2.4% of patients had NS5A RASs at the corresponding positions.

All patients with RASs at positions 28 or 31, or patients with ≥2 NS5A RASs achieved SVR12 (Fig. 3C, Table 2).

The SVR12 rate was 97.1% (99 of 102) in patients with variants at NS5A position 30 alone or together with other variants (Fig. 3C, Table 2), compared with 98.9% (176 of 178) in patients without NS5A RASs.

NS5A RASs at position 93, generally associated with high levels of resistance to NS5A inhibitors, were observed in 24.2% (101 of 417) patients.

Of the patients with RASs at position 93, 97.0% (98 of 101) of patients achieved SVR12 following 12 weeks of SOF/VEL/VOX.

In GT3, Y93H alone or with other RASs was observed in 26.0% (32 of 123) of patients with HCV GT3 and 93.8% (30 of 32) of these patients achieved SVR12 (data not shown).

PARAGRAPH

Additionally, three patients had the NS5A P32 deletion (0.7%, 3 of 417) that confers high levels of resistance to LDV and daclatasvir, but not VEL; all achieved SVR12 following 12 weeks of SOF/VEL/VOX.

SECTION

Prevalence and impact of baseline NS3 VOX-specific and NS5A VEL-specific RASs (15% assay cut-off)

PARAGRAPH

As both VOX and VEL have been designed to have improved activity against NS3 and NS5A RASs known to confer resistance to earlier generation NS3/4A PIs and NS5A inhibitors, many NS3 and NS5A class-specific RASs are still susceptible to VOX and VEL, respectively (Table S2).

Therefore, we analyzed the prevalence of the NS3 VOX or NS5A VEL-specific RASs, alone or in combination, that confer >2.5-fold reduced susceptibility to either VOX or VEL when present as single variants.

PARAGRAPH

Overall in the POLARIS-1 and 4 studies, 188 of 417 (45.1%) had baseline NS3 VOX- and/or NS5A VEL-specific RASs (Fig. 1D).

The majority of these were VEL-specific RASs (43.6%).

The prevalence of VOX-specific RASs was low (2.6%).

The presence of baseline VOX- or VEL-specific RASs did not affect the SVR12 rate with 97.9% of patients with VOX- and/or VEL-specific RASs achieving SVR12, compared with 98.3% for patients without these RASs.

Specifically, in NS5A inhibitor-experienced patients in POLARIS-1 with HCV GT3, A30K and Y93H alone or in combination with other NS5A RASs were observed in 16.2% (12 of 74) and 28.4% (21 of 74), respectively.

One patient with A30K did not achieve SVR12, but all patients with Y93H achieved SVR12.

PARAGRAPH

A small number of patients had only NS3 VOX-specific RASs (6 of 417), or had both NS3 VOX-specific and NS5A VEL-specific RASs (5 of417), and all achieved SVR12.

SECTION

Prevalence and impact of baseline RASs by level of resistance to VEL and VOX (15% assay cut-off)

PARAGRAPH

NS5A RASs were classified by level of resistance to VEL based on the in vitro fold change in EC50 conferred by single and double mutants compared to wild-type (Table S3).

Among NS5A inhibitor-experienced patients in POLARIS-1, 129 of 248 (52.0%) patients had NS5A RASs conferring 2.5–100-fold reduced susceptibility to VEL and 66 of 248 (26.6%) patients had high-level NS5A RASs conferring >100-fold (high-level) reduced susceptibility to VEL.

The overall SVR12 rates for patients with baseline NS5A RASs conferring 2.5–100-fold and >100-fold reduced susceptibility to VEL was 97.7% (126 of 129 patients) and 95.5% (63 of 66 patients), respectively (Fig. 4).

Among patients with HCV GT1a, 32 of 98 (32.6%) had NS5A RASs that conferred >100-fold reduced susceptibility to VEL and 13 patterns of single, double and triple RASs were identified (Table 3).

Except one patient with Y93N, all patients with HCV GT1a with high-level NS5A RASs achieved SVR12 (Table 3 and Fig. 4).

Among patients with HCV GT3a, 32 of 74 (43.2%) had NS5A RASs that conferred >100-fold reduced susceptibility to VEL and seven patterns of single and double RASs were identified, with the most common single NS5A RAS being Y93H.

SVR12 was achieved by 32 of 34 (94.1%) patients with HCV GT3a with high-level baseline NS5A RASs by 27 or 29 (93.1%) with GT3a and Y93H alone.

Other patients with Y93 in combination with another NS5A RASA30K+Y93H, A30K+L31M, A30S+Y93H and L31F+Y93H achieved SVR12.

None of the patients with HCV GT 2 (4 patients), 4 (21 patients), or 6 (6 patients) were identified as having NS5A RASs conferring >100-fold reduced susceptibility to VEL.

Similar results obtained when a cut-off of 5-fold reduced susceptibility to VEL was used (Fig. S1).

The overall SVR12 rates for patients with no RASs or NS5A RASs conferring <5-fold, 5–100-fold, and >100-fold reduced susceptibility to VEL was 97.4% (116 of 119), 98.4% (62 of 63 patients) and 95.5% (63 of 66 patients), respectively.

PARAGRAPH

None of the baseline NS3 RASs in DAA-experienced patients in POLARIS-1 or POLARIS-4 conferred a high level of resistance to VOX.

Across POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4, there were 19 and 37 patients who were previously treated with the NS3/4A PIs paritaprevir or simeprevir, respectively.

Except one patient who received prior treatment with simeprevir and did not have NS3 RASs, all patients with prior NS3/4A PI treatment with and without NS3 RASs achieved SVR12 (Table S4)

SECTION

Prevalence and impact of NS5B NI RASs on treatment response

PARAGRAPH

NS5B NI RASs were detected in 7.6% of patients (33 of 434), including one patient with the NS5B NI RAS S282T and one with the double mutant L159F/S282T.

Thirty-two of the 33 patients with NS5B NI RASs (97.0%) achieved SVR12.

The two patients with NS5B S282T also had NS5A RASs at baseline and achieved SVR12 (Table S5).

SECTION

Virologic failure analyses

PARAGRAPH

In POLARIS-1, 7 of 263 patients (2.3%) did not achieve SVR12 due to virologic failure: six relapsed and one experienced on-treatment virologic failure with the pharmacokinetic data consistent with nonadherence.

All seven patients had cirrhosis and four had GT3a, two had GT1a, and one had GT4d.

The NS3, NS5A, and NS5B genes were successfully sequenced at baseline for all of the seven patients and for six of the seven patients at the time of virologic failure (Table 4).

The patient who experienced virologic breakthrough had GT1a infection and treatment-selected NS5A RASs L31M and Y93H, in addition to pre-existing NS3 Q80K and NS5A Q30T at baseline.

Four of the six patients who relapsed had baseline RASs that were observed at the same or higher frequency of the viral population at the time of relapse.

In addition, the NS5A selected RAS Y93H was observed in one patient with GT4d infection who relapsed.

No NS3 or NS5B NI selected RASs were found in any of the remaining five patients who relapsed.

PARAGRAPH

In POLARIS-4, 1 of 182 patients (0.5%) relapsed in the SOF/VEL/VOX 12-week group.

No NS3, NS5A, or NS5B NI RASs were detected at baseline or at the time of relapse in the HCV of this patient.

PARAGRAPH

Thus, 7 out of 417 DAA-experienced patients (1.7%) experienced relapse, one of whom demonstrated treatment-selected resistance.

SECTION

Phenotypic analyses of VEL and VOX

PARAGRAPH

Table S6 presents SOF, VEL, and VOX susceptibility data for NS5B, NS5A, and NS3 variants that were observed, at baseline or virologic failure, in DAA-experienced patients who experienced virologic failure.

Selected NS5A variants included L31M and Y93H in GT1a; L31M showed 16-fold reduced susceptibility to VEL and Y93H demonstrated 609-fold resistance to VEL.

The NS5A variants persistent from baseline were Q30T and Y93N and conferred no change and >100-fold change from wild-type genotype 1a replicon, respectively.

In GT3a, A30K (one patient) or Y93H (two patients) were observed at baseline and the time of relapse; A30K showed moderate (50-fold) and Y93H showed high (724-fold) resistance to VEL.

In one patient with GT 4d, Y93H selected.

Y93H showed little change in susceptibility to VEL in the GT4a replicon assay (2.9-fold).

The NS5B RAS E237G, which was previously observed in patients who experienced virologic failure with SOF-containing regimens was identified at baseline in one patient who also had the NS5A RAS Y93H at baseline and relapse.

E237G NS5B sequence at relapse was not available for the patient and the impact of E237G on virologic failure is unclear.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

NS5A inhibitors are a common component of DAA regimens and more recently developed agents have demonstrated pan-genotypic activity.

However, it has been shown that the majority of NS5A RASs observed in virologic failures persist for >96 weeks post-treatment.14

In comparison, NS3 RASs selected by NS3/4A PIs are replaced by wild-type HCV in the peripheral blood within a few weeks to months post-treatment, indicating reduced fitness of the NS3 variants in the absence of ongoing PI treatment.41–45

Here we describe the prevalence of pre-existing NS5A, NS3 and NS5B NI, RASs in patients infected with HCV GT1-6 in the randomized, controlled phase III clinical trials of SOF/VEL/VOX, as well as the relationship between these RASs and treatment outcome.

PARAGRAPH

Overall, baseline RASs in POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4 were very common and the DAA-experienced patients had broad representation of baseline NS3 and NS5A RASs that confer resistance to earlier NS3/4A PIs and NS5A inhibitors including substitutions in NS3 at position 80, 155, 156, and 168 and in NS5A at positions 28, 30, 31, and 93.

In POLARIS-1, the mean time from the most recent prior NS5A inhibitor containing regimen was 1.3 years (range 0.2–5.7 years).

Consistent with the observed persistence of NS5A RASs in other studies, the prevalence of NS5A RASs among the NS5A inhibitor-experienced patients in POLARIS-1 were common and present in 79% of patients.

For the NS3/4A PI-experienced patients in POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4, the mean time from the most recent NS3/4A protease inhibitor was 2.2 years (range: 0.2–6.9), and the patients with NS3 resistance-associated variants at baseline tended to have slightly shorter intervals between prior failure and dosing compared with those who did not have baseline NS3 resistance-associated variants (data not shown).

PARAGRAPH

Further assessment of the effect of baseline RASs and treatment outcome showed that there was no impact on SVR rates of RASs conferring more than 100-fold reduced susceptibility to VEL and 95.5% of the patients in POLARIS-1 with RASs conferring more than 100-fold reduced susceptibility to VEL achieved SVR12.

PARAGRAPH

Among the small number of patients who failed treatment, selection of resistance was uncommon.

In POLARIS-1 only one of the six patients who relapsed had GT4d HCV infection and selected NS5A RAS Y93H.

For the one patient who relapsed in the SOF/VEL/VOX 12-week group in POLARIS-4, no NS3, NS5A, or NS5B NI RASs were detected at baseline or at the time of relapse.

Treatment emergent substitutions at other positions of the entire NS5A gene beyond the pre-defined ones were not observed in more than one patient.

Although all virologic failures had cirrhosis, the overall SVR rate among DAA treatment-experienced patients with cirrhosis in POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4 was 95%, and although four of the seven patients who relapsed had GT3a HCV infection, the overall SVR12 rate among patients in POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4 with GT3 infection and cirrhosis was 94%.46

As highlighted by the high prevalence of diverse and multiple RASs across different HCV proteins, the current dataset presents, for the first time, a comprehensive clinical and virologic assessment of the small, but complex and heterogeneous population of patients who have failed highly effective DAA therapy.

Because of the vulnerability of this patient population, understanding the efficacy of retreatment strategies, and the consequences of subsequent failure, is paramount.

To date, these are the only phase III clinical trial data available to address these questions.

PARAGRAPH

There have been a limited number of small, phase II studies evaluating retreatment of NS5A and NS5B inhibitor-experienced patients.

Lawitz et al., showed that the type and the number of NS5A RASs at baseline were associated with virologic failure in patients who failed LDV/SOF-containing regimens and were retreated with LDV/SOF for 24 weeks.16

Gane et al., showed that RASs in patients with GT1 and GT2 who failed SOF/VEL or SOF/VEL/VOX and were retreated with SOF/VEL+ribavirin for 24 weeks, had no impact on treatment outcome, however, a lower SVR rate (77%, 10/13) was observed for those with GT3 and NS5A RASs.47

In part 2 of the phase II MAGELLAN-1 study in DAA-experienced patients who were previously treated with NS5A inhibitors and/or NS3/4A inhibitors, 12 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir resulted in an overall SVR12 rate of 89% (39/44) which was lower in those with NS5A baseline RASs (83% 20/24).48

Extension of treatment to 16 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir resulted in an overall SVR12 rate of 91% (43/47), and 96% (22/23) in those with NS5A RASs, respectively.

Among the nine patients with virologic failure in the two treatment arms, seven had treatment-selected resistance and four of these developed new NS3 and NS5A RASs including one patient who had virologic failure while on treatment and developed NS3 RAS A156V and NS5A RAS Y93H.49

PARAGRAPH

In contrast to the prior studies of regimens targeting two distinct HCV proteins, the presence of NS3, NS5A and/or NS5B NI RASs did not affect treatment outcome in DAA-experienced patients including those who were previously treated with NS5A inhibitors upon treatment with SOF/VEL/VOX for 12 weeks in phase III trials.

SOF/VEL/VOX demonstrated a high barrier to resistance and treatment-selected RASs were rare in patients who experienced virologic failure after treatment with SOF/VEL/VOX for 12 weeks.

In conclusion, these results show that daily treatment with the single-tablet regimen of SOF/VEL/VOX for 12 weeks is highly effective for a broad range of DAA-experienced patients infected with HCV of any genotype regardless the presence of RASs.
