TITLE

SNX10 mediates alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis by regulating the activation of chaperone-mediated autophagy

PARAGRAPH

Alcoholic liver disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Recent studies highlight the involvement of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism.

Our study reveals that deficiency of sorting nexin (SNX) 10 increases the stability of LAMP-2A by inhibiting cathepsin A maturation, resulting in the increase of CMA activity and, thus, alleviates alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis.
