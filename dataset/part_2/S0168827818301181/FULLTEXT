TITLE

SNX10 mediates alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis by regulating the activation of chaperone-mediated autophagy

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a spectrum of disorders ranging from reversible steatosis to life-threatening and irreversible cirrhosis, and, in some patients, hepatocellular cancer.1

Alcohol exposure induces oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which lead to hepatocyte apoptosis, necrosis, and necroptosis, as well as hepatic inflammation.

In addition, ethanol consumption disrupts lipid metabolism and subsequently results in the accumulation of excessive triglycerides in the liver, further aggravating liver injury.2

Even though much research has focussed on understanding the pathological features of ALD, the cellular mechanisms that defend against the detrimental effects of alcohol remain unclear.

Although therapeutic strategies, including alcohol abstinence, corticosteroids, biologics such as anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and liver transplantation have been used, these might not be always either practical or sufficient.3,4

Thus, there is an urgent need to develop specific therapies for ALD.

PARAGRAPH

Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a type of autophagy involved in the degradation of cytosolic proteins with a specific pentapeptide motif.

After being recognised and bound by HSC70, a constitutive cytosolic chaperone, these proteins are translocated to lysosomes for uptake by lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A) and depredation in lysosomes.5

CMA can be maximally activated under stress situations to ensure the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.

Dysfunction of CMA has been implicated in several human disorders resulting from failure to remove damaged proteins caused by insults such as oxidative stress, hypoxia, or proteotoxicity.6–9

Growing evidence highlights the involvement of CMA in regulating hepatic lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and suggests that dysfunction of CMA has a major role in hepatic metabolic dysregulation.10,11

Thus, there is a need to determine whether CMA activation can contribute to relieving ethanol-induced liver injury and abnormal hepatic lipid metabolism.

PARAGRAPH

Sorting nexins (SNXs) are evolutionarily conserved phosphoinositide-binding proteins with a phox homology (PX) domain that targets SNXs to endosomal membranes and regulates endosome sorting and trafficking.12,13

As one of the simplest structural members of the SNX family, SNX10 has been reported to have a regulatory function in the endosomal/lysosomal pathway14 that is required for CMA to execute its function.

Therefore, we hypothesised that SNX10 might have a role in the pathogenesis of ALD by regulating CMA activity.

In the present study, the Lieber–DeCarli liquid alcohol diet in a mouse model and primary cultured hepatocytes stimulated with ethanol was used to investigate the role of SNX10 in mediating CMA activity.

Animal experiments

PARAGRAPH

Snx10−/− homozygous and heterozygous littermate PB mice with a FVB background were transferred from the Institute of Development Biology and Molecular Medicine, Fudan University, Shanghai, China to our laboratory.

Male wild-type (WT) and Snx10−/− mice (8 weeks old, 10 mice in each group) were used for the study.

For the liver conditional Snx10 KO study, B6.Vil-Cre and B6.Snx10fl/fl mice, with a background in C57BL/6J, were purchased from Shanghai Biomodel Organism Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd, and bred and maintained in the Animal Experiment Center of the School of Pharmacy, Fudan University.

Vil-Cre mice were crossed with Snx10fl/fl mice to generate Vil-Cre-Snx10fl/fl (WT control mice) and Vil-Cre+ Snx10fl/fl (Snx10 CKO) mice.

Male Vil-Cre-Snx10fl/fl and Vil-Cre+ Snx10fl/fl mice (8 weeks old, three mice in each group) were used for the study.

The mice were housed in a controlled temperature (25 ± 1 °C) and humidity (50 ± 5%) environment with a 12-h light/dark cycle and allowed free access to sterilised food and water.

All animal procedures were performed following the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Experimental Research, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University.

All efforts were made to reduce the number of animals used and to minimise animals’ suffering.

PARAGRAPH

Mice were fed the Lieber–DeCarli ethanol diet containing increasing (1–5% vol/vol) ethanol for the 1st week and 5% ethanol for 4 weeks.

The pair-fed group was treated with an isocaloric control liquid diet throughout the feeding period.

Liver injury was assessed by the determination of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity and haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of liver sections, as described elsewhere.15

SECTION

Primary culture of hepatocytes

PARAGRAPH

Mouse hepatocytes were isolated from the livers of male WT and Snx10−/− mice by the retrograde, non-recirculating perfusion of livers with 0.05% Collagenase Type IV (Sigma) based on a previously published method.16

After initial culture in William’s medium E (Sigma) with 10% foetal calf serum for attachment, cells were treated with ethanol (80 mM) in serum-free William’s medium E for 6 h. All cells were maintained in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.

SECTION

Lysosome isolation

PARAGRAPH

Lysosomes were isolated from the livers of male WT and Snx10−/− mice by centrifugation of a light mitochondrial-lysosomal fraction in a discontinuous metrizamide density gradient; a fraction enriched in the subpopulation of lysosomes active for CMA was further separated by differential centrifugation, as previously described.17

Lysosome integrity was verified by measuring β-hexosaminidase activity latency and only preparations with <10% broken lysosomes were used.18

SECTION

Binding and uptake of CMA substrate proteins by isolated lysosomes

PARAGRAPH

Direct binding and uptake of CMA substrates by lysosomes were measured according to previously described methods.19

Briefly, freshly isolated lysosomes (75 μg) treated with or without a cocktail of protease inhibitors, were incubated in MOPS buffer with GAPDH (25 mg; Sigma–Aldrich, G2267) for 20 min at 37 °C, and were then collected by centrifugation followed by SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting with anti-GAPDH antibodies.

Binding of GAPDH was calculated from densitometric analysis as the amount of GAPDH bound to the lysosomal membrane in the absence of protease inhibitors.

Uptake of GAPDH was determined by the difference between the amount of GAPDH associated with lysosomes in the presence (protein bound to the lysosomal membrane and taken up by lysosomes) and absence (protein bound to the lysosomal membrane) of protease inhibitors.

SECTION

PARAGRAPH

Western blot was performed using the standard protocol.

For RT-qPCR analysis, total RNA from cells and liver tissues were isolated.

RT-qPCR was performed as described previously.20

Reactions were performed in triplicate.

All primers used for RT-qPCR analysis were synthesised by Invitrogen.

Primer sequences are listed in Table S1.

Results

SECTION

SNX10 deficiency ameliorates ethanol-induced lipid metabolism disorder and hepatic steatosis in mice

PARAGRAPH

To explore the possible role of SNX10 in ALD, we first detected whether the expression of SNX10 in liver was affected by ethanol consumption.

Interestingly, the level of SNX10 increased significantly in WT mice fed the Lieber–DeCarli ethanol diet compared with WT mice pair-fed a control liquid diet (Fig. 1A).

We then compared the ethanol-induced weight loss between Snx10 KO and WT mice.

As shown in Fig. 1A, the ethanol diet induced a significant reduction in the body weight of WT mice from 2 to 4 weeks, but had no effect on the body weight of Snx10 KO mice.

The increase in the liver:body weight ratio was more conspicuous in ethanol-fed WT mice than in their Snx10 KO littermates (Fig. 1B).

Similarly, levels of triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol (TC) in both serum and liver were significantly reduced in ethanol-fed Snx10 KO mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 1C,D).

PARAGRAPH

Ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis was evaluated by H&E and Oil Red O staining of liver tissue sections.

Livers from ethanol-fed Snx10 KO mice showed a decreased number and size of vacuoles compared with those from WT mice, indicating diminished lipid accumulation (Fig. 1E,F).

These results provide compelling evidence that a lack of SNX10 reduces the effects of ethanol-induced lipid metabolism disorder and hepatic steatosis.

SECTION

SNX10 deficiency alleviates ethanol-induced liver injury, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response

PARAGRAPH

The bodyweight and hepatic histology results suggest that SNX10 deficiency alleviates ethanol-induced hepatic injury.

Accordingly, an ethanol diet resulted in a significant increase in serum ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increases that were then reduced by SNX10 deficiency (Fig. 2A).

Given that induction of oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokine production are key features of ALD,21 it was unsurprising that levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines were also detected.

An ethanol diet resulted in an increased serum malondialdehyde (MDA) level, which was significantly alleviated by Snx10 KO (Fig. 2B,C).

In addition, a higher serum level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was found in ethanol-fed Snx10 KO mice (Fig. 2B).

Importantly, SNX10 deficiency reduced the ethanol-induced increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein carbonyls and MDA, and upregulated the level of SOD in liver tissues (Fig. 2C).

Consistently, ethanol-fed Snx10 KO mice displayed higher mRNA levels of antioxidants, such as Sod1, Gsr, and Gpx2, than did WT mice (Fig. S2).

Furthermore, mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including Il6, Tnf, Il1b, and Il23, were increased in ethanol-treated WT mice, but were reduced by Snx10 KO.

These results suggest that SNX10 deficiency prevents ethanol-induced injury by suppressing oxidative stress and the inflammatory response.

SECTION

SNX10 deficiency increases CMA activity by preventing the degradation of LAMP-2A

PARAGRAPH

Given that CMA is involved in regulating liver metabolic homeostasis,11 we next focused on whether SNX10 has a role in CMA.

Intracellular levels of LAMP-2A, but not of other lysosomal proteins (e.g. LAMP-1; Fig. 3A) were higher in Snx10 KO hepatocytes than in WT hepatocytes under both basal and ethanol-treated conditions (Fig. 3A).

In addition, there was a consistent increase in HSC70, a key component of CMA that is responsible for the selective uptake of proteins degraded by this lysosomal pathway.22

Consistently, a decrease in the CMA substrate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in Snx10 KO hepatocytes was observed, indicating increased CMA activity (Fig. 3A,B).

Immunofluorescent staining showed that ethanol treatment significantly increased the number and intensity of LAMP-2A-positive vesicles, which were more intensively expressed in cells lacking SNX10 than in those with SNX10 (Fig. 3C,D).

Similarly, there were higher levels of LAMP-2A and HSC70 and a lower level of GAPDH in livers from ethanol-fed Snx10 KO mice.

However, the levels of other lysosomal membrane proteins (e.g. LAMP-1) remained unchanged (Fig. 3E,F).

PARAGRAPH

To further verify the function of SNX10 in CMA, a rescue experiment was conducted.

GFP-tagged hSNX10 plasmids and empty vectors were transfected into Snx10 KO hepatocytes and then examined for the presence of CMA-related proteins.

SNX10 transfection reversed the upregulation of HSC70 and LAMP-2A and the downregulation of GAPDH induced by Snx10 KO (Fig. 3G,H), suggesting an essential function of SNX10 in regulating CMA activity.

PARAGRAPH

Higher levels of CMA activity are often mediated by an increase in levels of LAMP-2A and its chaperone HSC70.22

As confirmation of this observation, CMA activation was detected as a change in the fluorescence pattern of GAPDH from diffuse to punctate on delivery of the CMA substrate to lysosomes.

The number of fluorescent puncta per cell is a reliable measurement of CMA activity.23

Under ETOH-free culture conditions (basal CMA activity), Snx10 KO hepatocytes displayed a significant increase in GAPDH puncta (Fig. 4A,B), which was reinforced by ETOH treatment, confirming upregulated CMA activity.

Furthermore, we used a well-established assay to analyze the proteolytic breakdown of radiolabelled CMA substrates by intact lysosomes, recapitulating their binding and uptake in the lysosomal lumen.19

Interestingly, the proteolytic activity of lysosomes from WT and Snx10 KO liver was comparable when the lysosomal membranes were disrupted (Fig. S3).

This suggested that changes mainly occurred at the level of binding and uptake rather than at proteolysis.

Therefore, immunoblots were used to assess the amounts of GAPDH bound to (without protease inhibitor treatment) or associated with lysosomes (with protease inhibitor treatment).

These showed higher levels of binding and uptake of GAPDH in lysosomes isolated from Snx10 KO mice (Fig. 4C).

PARAGRAPH

To determine the mechanism of increased levels of LAMP-2A and the resulting upregulated CMA induced by Snx10 KO, LAMP-2A mRNA in WT, and SNX10 KO hepatocytes was measured.

There was no significant difference in the levels of Lamp2 and Gapdh mRNA between WT and Snx10 KO hepatocytes (Fig. 4D), suggesting that post-transcriptional mechanisms other than transcriptional upregulation contribute to the increased level of LAMP-2A induced by Snx10 KO.

Changes in the stability of LAMP-2A have been described to modulate the level of this protein at the lysosomal membranes.22

By comparing the kinetics of LAMP-2A degradation in the membranes of lysosomes, we found a slower degradation rate and higher stability of LAMP-2A in the membranes of lysosomes isolated from livers of Snx10 KO mice (Fig. 4E), indicating that SNX10 deficiency increases CMA activity by preventing the degradation of LAMP-2A.

SECTION

Upregulation of Nrf2-HO1 signalling pathway induced by SNX10 deficiency relies on CMA activation

PARAGRAPH

Alcohol consumption causes a significant increase in oxidative stress and, thus, results in liver injury.

Activated CMA has an essential role in removing damaged proteins by oxidative stress, hypoxia, or proteotoxicity.6–9

Therefore, we hypothesized that the protective effect of Snx10 KO against ethanol-induced liver injury could result from the increase in the antioxidant response following CMA activation.

As expected, the levels of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), a key factor in the activation of antioxidative defences,24 and its downstream signal proteins were significantly increased in Snx10 KO mice fed a liquid alcohol diet (Fig. 5A,B).

PARAGRAPH

To further confirm that the protective effect of Snx10 KO against ethanol-induced liver injury results from the increase in the antioxidant response following CMA activation, small interference RNAs (siRNAs) were used to downregulate LAMP-2A.

Immunoblots for intracellular antioxidative proteins demonstrated that nuclear Nrf2 protein levels were significantly increased in Snx10 KO hepatocytes compared with WT hepatocytes, whereas this difference was abolished by si-LAMP-2A (Fig. 5C,D).

Similarly, the increased protein levels of HO1 and SOD1 in Snx10 KO hepatocytes were also blunted by si-Lamp2 (Fig. 5C,D).

Higher levels of SOD and GSH and lower levels of MDA in ethanol-stimulated Snx10 KO hepatocytes were consistently reversed by si-Lamp2 treatment (Fig. 5E).

These results suggest that SNX10 deficiency-induced CMA activation is critical for the antioxidant stress response mediated by the Nrf2-HO1 signalling pathway, which could contribute to the reduction in ethanol-induced liver injuries.

SECTION

Increase in CMA activity induced by SNX10 KO is responsible for the activation of the AMPK signalling pathway

PARAGRAPH

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the reduction of hepatic steatosis in ethanol-fed Snx10 KO mice, the activation of the AMPK signalling pathway, a key pathway in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism, was determined by immunoblot.

Hepatic phosphorylated AMPKα and ACC as well as PGC1α were increased in Snx10 KO mice compared with WT mice, and ethanol treatment further enhanced these differences (Fig. 6A,B).

However, no significant difference was observed in total protein levels of AMPKα and ACC in the livers of WT and Snx10 KO mice regardless of whether they were fed an ethanol-based diet.

Correspondingly, patterns in the levels of key enzymes in total lysates extracted from WT or Snx10 KO hepatocytes transfected with negative control siRNA were similar to those from the liver of WT and Snx10 KO mice.

However, after blockage of the CMA pathway by si-Lamp2, the increases in phosphorylated AMPKα and ACC as well as PGC1α induced by Snx10 KO were abolished (Fig. 6C,D).

We then measured the hepatic mRNA levels of AMPK-mediated lipid metabolism genes, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (Srebp1), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (Scd1), fatty acid synthase (Fas), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (Cpt1) by RT-qPCR.

The levels of Srebp1, Scd1, and Fas mRNA were significantly reduced in Snx10 KO mice fed an ethanol diet, decreased in pair-fed Snx10 KO mice, whereas the levels of Cpt1 mRNA were significantly increased in ethanol-fed Snx10 KO mice (Fig. 6E).

These results indicate that the increased CMA activity induced by Snx10 KO is responsible for the activation of the AMPK signalling pathway, which could contribute to the amelioration of alcohol-induced lipid accumulation.

SECTION

Confirmation of the effects of SNX10 deficiency on alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis in liver-conditional SNX10-KO mice

PARAGRAPH

To further confirm the effects of Snx10 KO on alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis, liver-conditional Snx10 KO (Snx10 CKO) mice were generated (Fig. 7A,B) and fed the Lieber–DeCarli ethanol diet for 5 weeks.

Snx10 CKO mice showed a decrease in the levels of ALT and AST induced by ethanol (Fig. 7C).

Oil Red O staining on liver tissue sections revealed that hepatic Snx10 KO significantly decreased the number and size of positive vacuoles induced by an ethanol diet, indicating diminished lipid accumulation (Fig. 7D).

Western blot also confirmed upregulated LAMP-2A and activated Nrf2-HO1 and AMPK signalling pathways (Fig. 7E).

To explore the relationship between CMA and the increased activation of Nrf2 and AMPK induced by SNX10 deficiency, we then analyzed proteasome activation, given that the 20S proteasome is a substrate of CMA,25 and both Nrf2 and AMPK activation can be regulated by the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome system.24,26,27

SNX10 deficiency resulted in decreased PSMB5 (Fig. 7F), a component of the 20S proteasome, an effect that was abolished by chloroquine treatment.

This result was confirmed by results from liver-conditional Snx10 KO mice (Fig. 7G).

Furthermore, Ub–protein conjugate analysis also indicated that proteasome activation was inhibited in the livers of Snx10 CKO mice (Fig. 7H).

These results provide a connection between the enhanced CMA activation induced by SNX10 deficiency and the increased activation of the Nrf2 and AMPK signalling pathways.

SECTION

SNX10 deficiency increases the stability of LAMP-2A by inhibiting CTSA maturation

PARAGRAPH

CTSA is a lysosomal serine carboxypeptidase that is synthesised as a 54-kDa precursor/zymogen that is internalised into lysosomes and processed into its mature 32/20-kDa two-chain form.28–30

Previous studies showed that CTSA regulates CMA activity through the degradation of LAMP-2A.31

Our results showed that SNX10 could immunoprecipitate with CTSA (Fig. 8A).

We then analysed the expression and activation of CTSA.

Cleaved CTSA (the active form) was decreased in both Snx10 KO hepatocytes and mouse livers (Fig. 8B,C), and was further decreased by ethanol treatment.

By contrast, there was no difference in CTSA expression.

We then transfected GFP-tagged hSNX10 plasmids and empty vectors into WT hepatocytes, and found that cleaved CTSA, but not CTSA, was increased in SNX10-overexpressing hepatocytes (Fig. 8D).

We then conducted a rescue experiment to confirm the role of SNX10 in regulating CTSA maturation.

SNX10 transference eliminated the decrease in cleaved CTSA induced by SNX10 deficiency in hepatocytes regardless of ethanol treatment (Fig. 8E).

These results suggest that SNX10 deficiency interferes with the trafficking of CTSA into lysosomes, reducing its maturation and stabilising LAMP-2A, resulting in the upregulation of CMA activity.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

CMA is a selective form of autophagy, characterised by the direct translocation of substrate proteins from the cytosol across the lysosomal membrane for degradation inside lysosomes.5

Defective CMA activity has been described in different neurodegenerative diseases, lysosomal storage disorders, diabetes, and oxidative injury.8,32–34

A previous study reported that both macroautophagy and CMA are required for hepatocyte resistance to liver injury resulted from menadione-induced oxidative stress.35

Growing evidence indicates that CMA also has a critical role in controlling liver lipid metabolic homeostasis.

Hepatic Lamp2 KO blocks CMA activity, leading to prominent alterations in hepatic lipid metabolism and severe hepatosteatosis.11,36

ALD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

However, the pathogenesis of ALD in humans is largely unknown.

As a consequence, no new drugs for ALD have been successfully developed in recent years.

Given the role of CMA in oxidative stress and hepatic lipid metabolism, it is reasonable to hypothesise that the upregulation of CMA activity could be a strategy for ALD treatment.

In the present study, we showed that SNX10 has an essential role in regulating CMA activity by controlling CTSA maturation and, thus, prevents ethanol-induced liver injury and lipid metabolism disorder, providing a novel potential target for ALD intervention.

PARAGRAPH

Pathological features of ALD range from fatty liver to hepatic inflammation, necrosis, progressive fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Oxidative stress is a common underlying mechanism of hepatocellular damage.

In animal models, alcohol consumption induces lipid peroxidation because of increased free radical formation and decreased hepatic antioxidants, such as GSH.37,38

Moreover, treatment with an inhibitor of alcohol oxidation or an antioxidant effectively prevents or reduces alcohol-induced injury, highlighting the importance of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of ALD.39

CMA is upregulated in response to nutrient deprivation,40 oxidative stress,8 acute lipid overload,39 and proteotoxicity,9 and contributes to cellular quality control by removing damaged proteins.41

Consistent with the role of CMA in protein quality control, blockage of CMA in cultured cells renders them more susceptible to oxidative stress.42

In the present study, we found that CMA was activated upon ethanol exposure; SNX10 deficiency upregulated CMA activity and the levels of antioxidants SOD1, GSH, and GPX2, but downregulated the levels of pro-oxidant ROS and MDA.

These changes were abolished by Lamp2 knockdown in vitro, suggesting that SNX10-mediated CMA activation contributes to the amelioration of ethanol-induced hepatic oxidative damage.

PARAGRAPH

Nrf2 has an important role in protecting cells against oxidative and xenobiotic stress,43 can be induced in the liver of rodents by chronic ethanol feeding.24,44

Nrf2 KO caused dramatic mortality in ethanol-fed mice.45

The metabolism of ethanol increased the production of ROS, resulting in persistent oxidative stress.

Increased ROS also activates Nrf2, thereby regulating gene expression of antioxidants and phase II detoxification enzymes through binding to the antioxidant response element,46–48 thus protecting hepatocytes from ethanol toxicity.

In the present study, we found that SNX10 deficiency significantly increased nuclear Nrf2 and HO1 expression, which was then abolished by Lamp2 siRNA.

This suggests that the activation of Nrf2-HO1 signalling pathway induced by SNX10 deficiency results from the upregulation of CMA activity.

PARAGRAPH

Steatosis, as the earliest and most common response of the liver to chronic alcohol consumption, has been considered as a benign and reversible pathological change.

Current evidence indicates that chronic hepatic steatosis renders the liver more susceptible to the development of advanced ALD, such as steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, and cirrhosis.

Numerous studies have supported the connection between AMPK and ethanol-induced liver injury.49,50

As a key metabolic ‘master switch’, AMPK regulates lipid metabolism by phosphorylating target enzymes.

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid synthesis, is inactivated by AMPK-mediated phosphorylation, decreasing fatty acid synthesis.51

Consistent with previous reports, the phosphorylation of AMPK was increased in mice fed ethanol, both in whole liver and in hepatocytes.50

However, a more robust increase in phosphorylated AMPK and ACC was observed in the liver of ethanol-treated SNX10 mice.

The inactivation of ACC reduces malonyl-CoA, the product of the reaction of ACC-inhibited CPT1, leading to increases in fatty acid oxidation in liver.51

AMPK activation also shuts down anabolic processes, and switches on fatty acid oxidation by phosphorylating PGC-1α.52

AMPK also suppresses hepatic Srebp1c mRNA expression by inhibiting endogenous LXR ligand production,53 thereby mediating the enzymes involved in the cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthetic pathways, including FAS and SCD.54

In the present study, Snx10 KO increased the activation of AMPK and the phosphorylation of ACC and PGC-1α and alleviated ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis, indicating an important role of SNX10 in regulating the AMPK–ACC pathway.

PARAGRAPH

The role of the CMA pathway in regulating liver lipid and carbohydrate metabolism has been described elsewhere.11

CMA acts as a major protective pathway against steatosis by inhibiting lipogenesis and facilitating β-oxidation and fat export.

It can also modulate intracellular lipolysis by selectively removing PLINs from discrete regions on the surface of lipid drops,36 which requires an AMPK-mediated phosphorylation event.55

The activity of CMA is often mediated by the level of the CMA receptor LAMP-2A and its chaperone HSC70.22,56

Notably, Lamp2−/− cells displayed reduced levels of phosphorylated AMPK and ACC, suggesting a reciprocal interplay between CMA and AMPK.

In addition to being regulated by the cellular AMP:ATP ratio, the activation of AMPK can be regulated by post-translational modifications of Ub.27

Inhibition of the 26S proteasome leads to rapid activation of AMPK, which is related to increased levels of nondegraded Ub–protein conjugates.26

Proteasomes and lysosomes are the major cellular systems that degrade proteins and recycle free amino acids for energy and new protein synthesis, and different protein degradation systems are able to reciprocally regulate one another.

Previous studies have shown that subunits of the 20S proteasome are the substrates of CMA,25 and increased rates of substrate degradation by proteasomes can compensate for hepatic CMA blockage in young mice.57

In our present study, hepatic SNX10 deficiency increased CMA activation, therefore increasing the degradation of 20S proteasomes and suppressing proteasome activity, leading to the diminished degradation of endogenous polyubiquitinated proteins and contributing to the enhanced activation of the AMPK signalling pathway and Nrf2.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, in the current study, SNX10 was upregulated by ethanol stimulation in hepatocytes.

Deficiency in SNX10 increased CMA activity by enhancing LAMP-2A stability, inhibiting proteasome activity and resulting in the activation of the Nrf2–HO1 and AMPK signalling pathways.

This in turn prevented hepatic oxidative stress and steatosis induced by ethanol consumption, and subsequently protected the mice against ethanol-induced liver injury (Fig. 9).

Our study reveals a crucial role for SNX10 in regulating CMA activity, and provides evidence for SNX10 as a potential promising therapeutic target for halting injury in ALD.

We propose SNX10 as an attractive target for future therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing CMA activity in ALD.
