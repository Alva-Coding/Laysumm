TITLE

HBsAg seroclearance further reduces hepatocellular carcinoma risk after complete viral suppression with nucleos(t)ide analogues

PARAGRAPH

We investigated 20,263 nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA)-treated patients with chronic hepatitis B. Patients with NA-induced hepatitis B surface antigen seroclearance on top of complete viral suppression have a lower risk of hepatocellular carcinoma but not hepatic events than those only achieving complete viral suppression under prolonged NA treatment.
