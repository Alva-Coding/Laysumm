Hepatitis C reinfection after successful antiviral treatment among people who inject drugs: A meta-analysis

PARAGRAPH

Our findings demonstrate that although reinfection by hepatitis C virus occurs following successful treatment in people with recent drug use, the rate of hepatitis C reinfection is lower than the rates of primary infection reported in the literature for this population â€“ reinfection should not be used as a reason to withhold therapy from people with ongoing injecting drug use.

The rate of hepatitis C reinfection was lowest among people receiving opioid agonist therapy with no recent drug use.

These data illustrate that harm reduction services are required to reduce the reinfection risk, while regular post-treatment hepatitis C assessment is required for early detection and retreatment.
