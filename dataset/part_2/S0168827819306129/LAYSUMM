TITLE

Simplified monitoring for hepatitis C virus treatment with glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir, a randomised non-inferiority trial

PARAGRAPH

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for hepatitis C is highly effective and well tolerated.

The SMART-C randomised trial evaluated an 8-week regimen of glecaprevir-pibrentasvir for hepatitis C treatment, using a simplified monitoring schedule that included no pathology tests or clinic visits during treatment.

This simplified strategy produced a high cure rate (92%), but this was not equivalent to the standard monitoring schedule cure rate (95%).
