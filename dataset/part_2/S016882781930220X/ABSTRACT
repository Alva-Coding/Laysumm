ABSTRACT

TITLE

Inherited non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and dyslipidemia due to monoallelic ABHD5 mutations

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a multifactorial condition and the most common liver disease worldwide, affecting more than one-third of the population.

So far there have been no reports on mendelian inheritance in families with NAFLD.

PARAGRAPH

We performed whole-exome or targeted next-generation sequencing on patients with autosomal dominant NAFLD.

PARAGRAPH

We report a heritable form of NAFLD and/or dyslipidemia due to monoallelic ABHD5 mutations, with complete clinical expression after the fourth decade of life, in 7 unrelated multiplex families encompassing 39 affected individuals.

The prevalence of ABHD5-associated NAFLD was estimated to be 1 in 1,137 individuals in a normal population.

PARAGRAPH

We associate a Mendelian form of NAFLD and/or dyslipidemia with monoallelic ABHD5 mutations.
