TITLE

Radiofrequency ablation vs. surgery for perivascular hepatocellular carcinoma: Propensity score analyses of long-term outcomes

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Recent clinical guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have indicated that liver transplantation, surgical resection (SR), and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are curative treatment modalities for very early or early stage HCC.1,2

Although the best therapy is liver transplantation, owing to the scarcity of donor organs, high cost, and longer waiting period of transplantation, SR and RFA have been mainstays for the curative treatment of HCC in clinical practice.3

Many studies compared the therapeutic efficacy of these two therapies, and most of these studies demonstrated that the efficacy of RFA and SR in terms of survival outcomes was similar for a single small HCC of ≤3 cm.4–7

PARAGRAPH

In contrast to SR using a laparoscopic or open approach, tumor location is an important factor in the outcomes of RFA, because it is mainly performed using a percutaneous approach for minimal invasiveness.8

Therefore, the high-risk locations of HCC adjacent to extrahepatic vital organs or large intrahepatic vessels can affect the treatment outcomes after RFA.9,10

In particular, there are controversies on the local tumor control by RFA because of the heat-sink effect, which can modify the size of the ablation zone considerably in patients with perivascular HCCs.11–13

In addition, recent studies suggested that the iatrogenic transportal tumor spread may occur in periportal tumors during RFA because RFA cannot remove a hepatic segment confined to tumor-bearing portal tributaries.14,15

PARAGRAPH

However, comparative studies of therapeutic outcomes for perivascular HCC between SR and RFA have not been performed.

In addition, previous retrospective studies16,17 have indicated that, compared with surgical candidates, patients who underwent RFA were likely to be older and present poor liver function, which could affect the long-term outcomes of each treatment.

PARAGRAPH

Thus, the aim of this study was to retrospectively compare the long-term therapeutic outcomes of SR and RFA as a first-line treatment for a small (≤3 cm) single perivascular HCC by propensity score matching analysis.

Patients

PARAGRAPH

This comparative study was conducted as a retrospective analysis at a single tertiary academic center.

The study was approved by the institutional review board, and the requirements for informed consent were waived (SMC 2017-07-062).

Between January 2006 and December 2010, 6,172 consecutive patients were diagnosed with treatment-naïve HCCs at the Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea.

Of these, 836 patients underwent SR and 711 patients received RFA as a first-line treatment.

The criteria for HCC treatment were identical to those described in our previous studies.18,19

The inclusion criteria for this study were i) a small solitary HCC (≤3 cm); ii) Child-Pugh class A or B cirrhosis; iii) use of multiphase dynamic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for pre-treatment assessment; iv) absence of macrovascular invasion and extrahepatic metastasis on pre-treatment imaging evaluation; and v) more than six months follow-up after treatment.

Patients were classified into perivascular and non-perivascular groups based on the presence of a peritumoral vessel.

Finally, patients who underwent SR (n = 182) or RFA (n = 101) for a perivascular HCC were included.

HCC was histologically confirmed in six patients (5.9%) from the RFA group by percutaneous biopsy, whereas the remaining 95 patients were diagnosed with HCC based on clinical criteria.

In the SR group, histologic diagnoses were made in all patients after treatment.

The diagnostic criteria for HCC were based on the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines that were current at the time of treatment.20

The workflow of patient selection for this study is detailed (Fig. 1).

SECTION

Definition of perivascular HCC

PARAGRAPH

On the basis of previous experimental and clinical studies, perivascular HCC was defined as a tumor abutting the first- or second-degree branches of a portal or hepatic vein, with an axial diameter greater than or equal to 3 mm.11–13

All tumors were retrospectively classified by two radiologists (S.L. and T.W.K.) who reviewed all pre-treatment CT or MRI examinations and were blinded to clinical outcomes by consensus.

Axial images were evaluated using a picture archiving and communication system (Centricity 3.0, GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA) under magnification.

If the index tumor was in contact with more than two vessels, the largest vessel was selected as the reference vessel.

Discrepancies between the two radiologists on these classifications were used for inter-observer agreement analysis.

SECTION

Surgical procedure

PARAGRAPH

Hepatic resection was performed by one of three experienced surgeons (J.M.K., C.H.D.K., and J.W.J., all with more than 10 years of experience in hepatobiliary surgery).

Liver resection in our center was briefly summarized in the previous study.18

Anatomical resection was routinely performed in patients with a perivascular HCC, however, non-anatomical resection was performed in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis or a peripherally located tumor.

SECTION

RFA procedure

PARAGRAPH

RFA procedures were performed with real-time ultrasonography guidance by one of four radiologists (M.W.L., H.R., H.K.L., and Y.S.K., all with more than six years of experience in RFA) on an inpatient basis.

We used commercially available electrode systems with generators (Cool-tip RF System [Covidien, Mansfield, Mass, USA] and the VIVA RF system [STARmed, Ilsan, Korea]).

Treatments were performed under local anesthesia and conscious sedation or monitored anesthesia care.

The detailed methodology used to execute the RFA was identical to that used in previous studies.19,21

Our therapeutic strategy for RFA was to create an ablative margin of at least 0.5 cm in the normal hepatic parenchyma surrounding the tumor except the perivascular portion on ultrasonography.11

In cases in which a residual unablated tumor was detected on CT examination performed immediately after RFA, an additional RFA session was attempted on the same or the following day.

Incomplete ablation after an additional treatment session was considered a technical failure, and these patients (2.4%, 13/544) underwent transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or SR for tumor control and were excluded from outcome analysis.

SECTION

Follow-up

PARAGRAPH

All patients in the RFA group underwent CT examination immediately after RFA to determine the technical success of the procedure and to assess immediate complications, while patients in the SR group underwent CT imaging if complications were clinically suspected during postoperative hospital stay.

After discharge, patients in both groups underwent an abdomen-pelvis CT scan with liver protocol, chest radiography, and laboratory tests, including serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), one month after initial treatment, every three months during the first two years, and every four to six months after that.

In cases in which extrahepatic recurrence (ER) was suspected on the basis of clinical symptoms or unexplained elevation of tumor marker levels, chest CT, brain MRI, whole-body bone scintigraphy, and positron emission tomography were performed.5

In addition, liver MRI was performed for further characterization when a new indeterminate hepatic lesion was detected on CT exam during follow-up.

In cases in which recurrent tumor was identified during follow-up, optimal second-line treatment such as RFA, surgery, TACE, liver transplantation, or radiation therapy was performed using the recommendations of a multidisciplinary team for HCC treatment, based on the characteristics of the recurrent tumor, hepatic function, and general condition of the patient.21

SECTION

Study outcomes

PARAGRAPH

The therapeutic outcomes were compared between the two groups by assessing the tumor progression and overall survival (OS) before and after propensity score matching.

Tumor progression was defined as HCC recurrence after initial treatment identified on imaging studies.

Tumor progression was classified as either intrahepatic or ER.

Intrahepatic recurrence (IR) was defined as the development of new tumors within the liver with or without contact with the ablation zone or resection margin.

ER included all HCC lesions diagnosed outside the liver.

The progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from initial treatment to tumor progression or death.22

OS was defined as the interval between treatment and death or the date of the last follow-up visit before December 31, 2016.

Liver transplantation was considered as censored at the date of transplantation.

Subgroup analysis of these outcomes was conducted according to the type of hepatic vessels.

In addition, interaction effects between the treatment group and type of peritumoral vessel were examined for these outcomes.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

For all data, continuous variables were analyzed using the two-sample t test if the assumption of normality was satisfied; otherwise, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used.

Categorical variables were analyzed using the χ2 test.

Inter-observer agreement for the classification of perivascular tumor was analyzed using Cohen’s kappa statistics.

The effect of selection bias and confounding factors was reduced by calculating the propensity score using logistic regression and performing 1:1 patient matching.23

The standardized mean difference was computed to assess the balance of variables used for matching and confirm whether the values were lower than 0.1.

The matched data in the groups were compared using the paired t test or Wilcoxon signed rank test for continuous variables and the McNemar test for categorical variables.

The variables included in the propensity score model were age, underlying chronic liver disease, presence of liver cirrhosis, presence of portal hypertension, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, serum AFP, platelet count, albumin, and prothrombin time.

The clinical variables used for outcome analysis included cirrhosis confirmed at histologic or clinical examination (including laboratory and imaging findings) and portal hypertension diagnosed by the presence of one or more of the following parameters: formation of gastroesophageal varices, ascites, and splenomegaly with decreased platelet count (<100,000/mm3).7

The PFS and OS rate were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test, and the cumulative incidence curve for IR and ER was estimated using the Fine and Gray regression model for competing risk.

Univariate and multivariate analysis of all data was performed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model for PFS and OS.

The variables with p <0.2 on univariate analysis were included in the final multivariate model.

Furthermore, we estimated the hazard rate of IR over time using a life table method to investigate whether recurrence patterns differ between two groups.

Statistical analyses were performed using software SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and R version 3.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Differences of p <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

SECTION

Baseline characteristics

PARAGRAPH

The baseline characteristics of all patients (n = 283) are presented (Table 1).

The median follow-up period was 92.4 months (range, 6.1–131.9 months) in the SR group and 93.6 months (range, 16.8–139.2 months) in the RFA group (p = 0.947).

Patients in the RFA group were significantly older and more likely to be classified as having poor liver function compared to those in the SR group, except total bilirubin level.

Although the serum AFP levels in the SR group were higher than in the RFA group, there was no significant difference in other tumor characteristics between the two groups.

The kappa value for the classification of perivascular HCCs by two radiologists was 0.88 (95% CI = 0.76–0.99).

The types of SR were as follows: wedge resection or tumorectomy as a non-anatomical resection (n = 29), segmentectomy (n = 44), sectionectomy (n = 61), central hepatectomy (n = 1), and hemihepatectomy (n = 47).

During follow-up, IR occurred in 66 of 182 patients (36.3%) in the SR group and in 80 of 101 patients (79.2%) in the RFA group.

The cumulative IR rates at 3-, 5-, 7-, and 10-years were 24.9%, 31.0%, 36.5%, and 54.7%, respectively, for the SR group, and 60.1%, 69.6%, 76.6%, and 92.1%, respectively, for the RFA group (p <0.001) (Fig. 2A).

ER was identified in 20 patients (11.0%) in the SR group and 19 patients (18.8%) in the RFA group.

The 3-, 5-, 7- and 10-year cumulative ER rates were 5.5%, 8.7%, 10.8%, and 15.3% in the SR group, and 9.1%, 14.2%, 17.5%, and 24.2% in the RFA group, respectively (p = 0.102) (Fig. 2B).

PFS and OS

PARAGRAPH

As of December 31, 2016, 21 of 182 (11.5%) patients in the SR group and 33 of 101 (32.7%) patients in the RFA group died.

The 3-, 5-, 7-, and 10-year PFS rates were 68.3%, 61.6%, 58.7%, and 32.7% in the SR group and 37.8%, 24.5%, 14.5%, and 12.4% in the RFA group, respectively (p <0.001) (Fig. 2C).

SECTION

Hazard rate of intrahepatic recurrence over time

PARAGRAPH

The risk of IR in the SR group steadily decreased over time until three years after initial treatment, with the risk remaining steady during the rest of follow-up.

However, the RFA group showed a different pattern of IR.

A peak indicating an elevated risk of IR appeared at approximately 1.5 years with no further peak afterward (Fig. 3).

SECTION

Comparison of therapeutic outcomes after propensity score matching

PARAGRAPH

Sixty-two patients were matched in each group and the baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the two groups (Table 2).

Although tumor size, type and diameter of peritumoral vessel were not matching variables, they showed no significant intergroup difference after group matching (Table S1).

Using the matched data, the cumulative IR rates at 3-, 5-, 7-, and 10-years were estimated to be 26.3%, 36.1%, 42.6%, and 70.2% in the SR group and 57.9%, 71.9%, 79.3%, and 96.7% in the RFA group, respectively (p <0.001) (Fig. 4A).

The cumulative ER rates at 3-, 5-, 7- and 10-years were 3.0%, 7.4%, 8.8%, and 12.5% for the SR group and 6.9%, 16.6%, 19.5%, and 26.9% for the RFA group, respectively (p = 0.062) (Fig. 4B).

The PFS rates at 3-, 5-, 7-, and 10-years were 68.7%, 58.0%, 56.0%, and 17.8% in the SR group and 41.2%, 25.4%, 14.1%, and 14.1% in the RFA group, respectively (p <0.001) (Fig. 4C).

The estimated OS rates at 3-, 5-, 7- and 10-years were 98.4%, 93.5%, 91.9%, and 91.9% in the SR group and 91.9%, 82.3%, 74.1%, and 74.1% in the RFA group, respectively (p <0.001) (Fig. 4D).

SECTION

Analysis of risk factors for therapeutic outcomes

PARAGRAPH

On multivariate analysis of all study patients (n = 283), RFA (hazard ratio [HR] 2.26; 95% CI 1.52–3.35; p <0.001), old age (HR 1.03; 95% CI 1.01–1.05; p = 0.002) and, tumor size (HR 1.31; 95% CI 1.01–1.71; p = 0.044) were significant factors for poor PFS.

With respect to OS, RFA (HR 2.25; 95% CI 1.14–4.46; p = 0.020) and the presence of liver cirrhosis (HR 2.56; 95% CI 1.12–5.82; p = 0.026) were independent poor prognostic factors for OS in patients with a small perivascular HCC (Table 3).

SECTION

Subgroup analysis by the type of peritumoral vessel

PARAGRAPH

Although IR, ER, PFS, and OS were significantly better in the SR group than in the RFA group in cases of periportal HCCs (n = 194, all p values <0.05), ER and OS were not significantly different in patients with perivenous HCCs according to the treatment modality (n = 89, p = 0.209 and p = 0.978, respectively) (Fig. S1).

Significant interaction effects between the treatment group and type of peritumoral vessel were observed for ER and OS (p = 0.007 and p = 0.015, respectively) (Table 4).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

We found that SR yielded better long-term tumor control and OS than RFA as a first-line treatment in patients with a small perivascular HCCs.

In addition, multivariate analysis indicated that SR was an independent favorable prognostic factor for PFS and OS in patients with perivascular HCC.

PARAGRAPH

In our study, the PFS rates were significantly different between the two groups regardless of the propensity score analysis.

Among the factors of PFS, IR was a significant difference between the two groups whereas ER demonstrated no significant intergroup difference.

IR includes local recurrence around the treatment area and intrahepatic distant recurrence, and each type of recurrence has a distinct mechanism of pathogenesis.24

Regarding perivascular tumor location, the heat-sink effect mediating convective heat loss into hepatic vessels adjacent to the tumor would theoretically make the ablation of perivascular tumor tissue insufficient and might lead to the decrease in local tumor control in the RFA group.12,13

However, our study population was limited to a small tumor size (≤3 cm) to avoid this disadvantage of RFA based on the findings of a previous study, wherein the therapeutic outcomes of RFA for small perivascular HCC (≤3 cm) were similar to those for non-perivascular HCC.11

In addition, the poor liver condition in the RFA group was adjusted for by matched analysis, because this condition might have increased the intrahepatic distant recurrence rates by hepatic carcinogenesis from pre-neoplastic cirrhotic liver.25,26

Despite all these efforts, IR was more common in the RFA group than in the SR group.

PARAGRAPH

In particular, our results indicated that the HR of IR was higher within two years after initial treatment in the RFA group than in the SR group.

This early IR in the RFA group seems to be similar with a previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the therapeutic efficacy of these two modalities in patients with HCC.27

In general, early recurrence (<2 years) is regarded as metastasis by tumor aggressiveness or incomplete treatment, and late recurrences (≥2 years) are primarily attributable to multistep or de novo carcinogenesis in a cirrhotic liver.28

Based on these assumptions, high early IR rate in the RFA group after initial treatment may be partly explained as follows: Firstly, some microsatellite nodules derived from perivascular HCC via peritumoral portal system may not be detected in pre-treatment imaging and thus would not be effectively eliminated by RFA because only the tumor and some of the surrounding liver are ablated, while most of the tumor-bearing hepatic segment is left unablated.

However, SR can remove the hepatic segment fed by tumor-bearing portal tributaries.29,30

Therefore, frequent early IR after RFA may be caused by the growth of untreated microsatellite lesions within the corresponding remaining segment.

Secondly, incomplete treatment because of the heat-sink effect in the RFA group, not detected on immediate follow-up CT, may have occurred and regrowth of untreated tumor could have manifested as an early IR during follow-up.

PARAGRAPH

Perivascular HCCs could be categorized into two groups; periportal HCCs and perivenous HCCs.

In subgroup analysis, according to the type of peritumoral vessels, ER and OS were significantly better in the SR group than in the RFA group in patients with periportal HCCs.

However, no significant differences were observed for ER and OS in patients with perivenous HCCs.

These results support there being an increased risk of ER when performing RFA for periportal HCCs compared to RFA for perivenous HCCs, with this increased risk potentially affecting the survival outcome.

In clinical practice, although IR can be controlled with subsequent treatments,31 effective therapy for tumor control would be limited if ER occurs.1,2

In line with these results, IR was not an independent factor for OS while ER was a significant factor among 1,305 patients initially treated with RFA for HCC in a previous study from our group.19

Although the current study did not provide the cause of difference in outcomes according to the type of peritumoral vessel, our results suggest that both RFA and SR can be considered as a first-line option for perivenous HCCs, while SR should be preferred over RFA for periportal HCCs.

PARAGRAPH

The ultimate goal of treatment for HCC is to improve patient survival.

Therapies should be selected on the basis of strong evidence such as meta-analyses including RCTs.32

However, RCTs that can suggest an optimal treatment option for small perivascular HCC are currently limited.

In this respect, our findings can provide useful information to physicians who are considering optimal treatment options for small perivascular HCCs.

Our results indicated that the location of the tumor and the type of peritumoral hepatic vessels need to be considered in the selection of SR or RFA for small HCC.

Although our RFA strategy for HCC followed current guidelines,33 the combined treatment with TACE34 and microwave ablation35 might be reasonable alternatives for those who are not eligible for resection in periportal HCCs.

However, more studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of these treatments.

PARAGRAPH

Our study had several limitations.

Firstly, we used a retrospective approach.

Thus, our study was inherently flawed by selection and indication bias.

Secondly, although we performed propensity score matching and multivariate analysis to enhance intergroup comparison, unidentified biases may have acted in favor of the SR group.

Thirdly, the analysis of the types of surgical techniques (anatomical resection or non-anatomical resection, open or laparoscopic resection) is critical when choosing the treatment modality, and these parameters were not considered in this study because of the small number of patients for additional matching.

Fourthly, the inter-observer validity in defining perivascular HCC needs external validation.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, SR provided better long-term tumor control and OS than RFA for patients with a small perivascular HCC (≤3 cm) as a first-line treatment, particularly for periportal tumors.

Moreover, clinicians should evaluate tumor location and the type of peritumoral vessels when balancing the risk–benefit of first-line treatment for small HCCs.
