TITLE

Molecular profiling of subclinical inflammatory lesions in long-term surviving adult liver transplant recipients

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Routine serum markers of liver injury such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferases (ALT), gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT) or alkaline phosphatase (AP) are known to be insensitive and nonspecific indicators of allograft rejection in liver transplantation (LT).1,2

Despite this, the long-term management of LT recipients continues to rely on a combination of serum liver biochemistry tests and calcineurin inhibitor pharmacokinetic markers.

The performance of protocol, or surveillance, liver biopsies has been proposed as a more accurate strategy to assess graft function and potentially to personalize the use of immunosuppression.3–5

This is based on a multiplicity of studies showing that a very large proportion of patients with normal liver biochemistry tests exhibit clinically significant histological lesions, with chronic hepatitis not attributable to recognizable causes, such as viral infection or autoimmune hepatitis, being the most frequently described abnormality.1,6–8

However, the clinical utility of protocol liver biopsies remains contentious,5 and as a result they are not performed in the vast majority of adult liver transplant programs.

The controversy stems from an incomplete understanding of the natural history and pathogenesis of the so-called idiopathic inflammatory lesions.2,9

This is due to the paucity of prospective clinical studies and the lack of in-depth studies comparing the molecular signatures of these lesions with those of well-characterized histological phenotypes.

PARAGRAPH

Employing microarray and real-time PCR analyses, we previously reported that it is possible to identify transcriptional signatures of acute cellular rejection in blood and liver tissue specimens of LT recipients.10,11

Importantly, these signatures can be detected even in the midst of the noise caused by other forms of chronic inflammation, such as that induced by hepatitis C virus (HCV).

We anticipated that a similar strategy could provide a clue as to the pathogenesis of idiopathic fibro-inflammatory lesions in adult liver transplant recipients who survive long-term.

To confirm this premise, we conducted a prospective clinical study in which we approached all surviving LT recipients transplanted at Hospital Clinic Barcelona between 1988 and 1999 without previously diagnosed allograft lesions, and performed liver biopsy, transient elastography, and next generation sequencing transcriptional studies.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Patient population

PARAGRAPH

Between December 2007 and December 2009 we screened all patients who had undergone LT at Hospital Clínic Barcelona between 1988 and 1999 and who remained alive and had been followed-up for more than 10 years after transplantation.

Exclusion criteria were: i) diagnosis of de novo or recurrent liver disease after transplantation, including HCV-related hepatitis; ii) elevation in AST, ALT or AP ≥2-fold above the upper limit of normal (isolated GGT increases were not considered an exclusion criteria [n = 18]); iii) T cell-mediated rejection within one year of the inclusion in the study; iv) contraindications for a liver biopsy; v) severe extrahepatic co-morbidities (Fig. 1).

All consented patients underwent a protocol liver biopsy and collection of a blood specimen.

Patients included in the study were followed-up until death, re-transplantation, loss to follow-up or December 2017.

PARAGRAPH

All patients signed an informed consent.

The study was approved by the ethical committee at Hospital Clínic Barcelona.

SECTION

Laboratory tests and fibrosis evaluation

PARAGRAPH

The following tests were performed at the time of inclusion: liver tests (serum AST, ALT, GGT, AP, total bilirubin, international normalized ratio [INR]); platelet count; serologies for hepatitis B (surface antigen, anti-core antibodies), hepatitis C, and hepatitis E (IgG anti-hepatitis E antibodies and RNA) viruses; and serum auto-antibodies (antinuclear antibodies, anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-liver-kidney microsomal antibodies).

Liver tests and platelet counts were also analyzed at the last follow-up visit.

Indirect fibrosis scores (AST to platelet ratio index [APRI] and Fibrosis 4 [FIB-4]) were calculated using the standard formulas at the time of inclusion and at the last follow-up.12,13

In addition, 30 patients underwent a liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with Fibroscan® transient elastography (Echosens, France) at the time of liver biopsy.

SECTION

Liver histopathology

PARAGRAPH

Hematoxylin-eosin and Masson’s trichrome stained sections were blindly assessed by two liver histopathologists (RM and LNS).

A semi-quantitative score was used to evaluate and grade different parameters as follows: i) Architectural abnormalities: 0 = absent; 1 = minimal abnormalities consistent with irregular regenerative foci; and 2 = moderate-marked with parenchymal atrophy and centrilobular collapse (with or without inflammation) or nodular regenerative hyperplasia; ii) Lobular inflammation: 0 = no inflammation; 1 = mild (sinusoidal inflammatory cells and/or mild focal necrosis); 2 = moderate (multiple necro-inflammatory foci); and 3 = marked (confluent or bridging necrosis); iii) Central perivenulitis (with or without endotheliitis): 0 = no inflammation; 1 = mild (patchy, focal perivenulitis); 2 = moderate (perivenulitis in most central veins); and 3 = marked (confluent or bridging hepatocellular necrosis); iv) Portal inflammation: 0 = no inflammation; 1 = mild (small groups of inflammatory cells); 2 = moderate (expansive inflammatory infiltrate in >50% of portal tracts); and 3 = marked (severe inflammatory infiltrate in most portal tracts), v) Interface hepatitis: 0 = no interface activity; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; and 3 = severe; vi) Bile duct lesion: 0 = no; 1 = minimal (intraepithelial inflammatory cells or abnormal cholangiocytes); 2 = moderate (epithelial lesions in most portal tracts, no destruction); and 3 = marked (destructive epithelial lesions in most portal tracts); vii) Bile duct loss: 0 = no loss; 1 = loss of bile ducts in <50% of the portal tracts; and 2 = loss in ≥50% of the portal tracts; viii) Portal vein branches: 0 = present in all portal tracts; 1 = absent in a minority of portal tracts; and 2 = absent in most portal tracts; ix) Portal vein endotheliitis: 0 = absent; 1 = mild (present in a minority of portal veins); 2 = moderate (present in most portal veins); and 3 = marked; x) Portal fibrosis: 0 = absent; 1 = minimal fibrosis (minority of portal tracts); 2 = moderate (periportal expansion in most portal tracts); 3 = bridging fibrosis; 4 = cirrhosis; xi) Perisinusoidal fibrosis: 0 = absent; 1 = focal; 2 = marked; xii) Steatosis: 0 = mild (<30% of hepatocytes); 1 = moderate (30–60%); and 2 = severe (>60% of hepatocytes).

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Categorical data were compared by Chi-squared or Fischer’s test as appropriate.

Continuous variables were compared by non-parametric testing (Mann-Whitney).

A cumulative odds ordinal logistic regression with proportional odds was run to determine the effect of severity of portal inflammation on the risk of having portal fibrosis.

We employed non-parametric analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for a smooth nonlinear effect of baseline using a spline function to rigorously explore the effects of module gene expression assignment on the following continuous variables: bilirubin, AST, ALT, INR, platelet count, APRI and FIB4.

Data are reported as adjusted mean difference and 95% CI.

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistical package version 23 and R.

SECTION

RNA extraction

PARAGRAPH

RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver biopsy specimens.

First, excessive paraffin surrounding the tissue was manually removed from the blocks and eight sections of 5 µm each were obtained and placed in Eppendorf tubes.

Tissue RNA was then isolated following deparaffinization, incubation with lysis buffer and DNase treatment according to the RNeasy® FFPE kit’s instructions (Qiagen, UK).

RNA was eluted using a RNeasy MinElute® spin column following ethanol addition.

The concentration and purity of the RNA was measured using Nanodrop (ThermoScientific) and Qubit RNA BR Assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and the RNA stored at −80 °C.

SECTION

RNA sequencing experiments

PARAGRAPH

Out of the 67 protocol liver biopsies performed as part of the study, 49 were employed to conduct RNA sequencing (RNASeq) experiments, while in the remaining cases this could not be completed because of insufficient liver tissue material, poor quality RNA or sub-optimal sequenced reads.

RNASeq was done in collaboration with Genetracer Biotech using the Ion Torrent Proton II (Thermo Fisher), which employs custom designed primers targeting multiple exons for all known protein coding genes, as a primary transcript detection strategy.

Briefly, 50 ng of RNA was used to generate sequencing libraries using the Ion AmpliSeq™ Transcriptome Human Gene Expression Kit (Thermo Fisher), and barcoded using Ion Express barcodes.

cDNA library quality was assessed using the Agilent® 2200 TapeStation System and the High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).

Templates were run on the Ion PI™ v3 chips using the Ion Chef system and Hi-Q™ Chef kits.

Sequencing depth per sample was 12 million genome-aligned reads.

Sequenced reads were mapped against the reference sequences including 20,800 different genes present in the AmpliSeq Human Gene Expression panel using Novoalign software V3.02.08 (http://www.novocraft.com).

Novoalign finds global optimum alignments using full Needleman-Wunsch algorithm showing better sensitivity than other aligners.14

After mapping, unique mapped reads were summarized as counts representing the gene expression levels for over 20,800 different genes present in the AmpliSeq Human Gene Expression panel.

Low expressed genes were excluded from downstream analysis if the sum of counts was lower than 100.

Transformation of count data to log2-counts per million (logCPM) was accomplished by estimating the mean-variance relationship and using this parameter to compute appropriate observational-level weights.

The resulting data was then used for linear modeling and differential expression by means of the Limma R-package.15

Fold-changes, moderated p values, and false discovery rates (FDR) obtained by adjusting p values for multiple testing using Benjamini-Hochberg, were calculated.

Additional RNASeq experiments were performed on RNA samples extracted from 18 archived diagnostic liver biopsies conducted at Hospital Clinic Barcelona during 2009.

These for-cause biopsies were performed in patients with allograft dysfunction and corresponded to eight samples of early T cell mediated rejection (within three months post-transplant); six samples of late (>1 year post-transplant) T cell mediated rejection; and four samples of post-transplant recurrent HCV infection.

Transcriptional data derived from the 18 for-cause biopsies were employed exclusively for functional pathway analysis and were not included in the remaining analyses.

PARAGRAPH

The raw data from Ion Torrent ampliseq transcriptome were deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; Bethesda, MD, USA) Short Read Archive database (Bioproject accession no. PRJNA437250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).

SECTION

Analysis of gene expression data

PARAGRAPH

To explore the correlation patterns among genes across the RNASeq data derived from the 49 protocol biopsies we employed the Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) software package available from R.16 To perform WGCNA, correlations between all pairs of genes in the expression dataset were quantified and transformed into measures of connection strength by emphasizing strong correlations and minimizing the noise in the pairwise measurements.

A hierarchical clustering algorithm was then used to identify modules of highly interconnected genes.

Next, to reduce multi-dimensionality, consensus eigengenes were defined for each module and used to relate the modules to external data (e.g. clinical traits).

PARAGRAPH

The statistical significance of a priori defined sets of genes representing biological pathways on the whole transcriptional dataset, which included the 49 protocol biopsies plus the 18 for-cause biopsies, was computed employing quantitative set analysis for gene expression (QuSAGE),17 using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database and the transplantation-related pathogenesis-based transcript (PBT) gene sets from the Alberta Transplant Applied Genomics Centre (ATAGC; http://atagc.med.ualberta.ca/Research/GeneLists).

For QuSAGE analysis, the threshold of statistical significance was set at FDR <0.10.

To identify pathways enriched in modules of co-expressed genes we employed the enricher function from ClusterProfiler R-package for hypergeometric tests.

PARAGRAPH

To interrogate whether biopsies exhibiting idiopathic inflammatory lesions were likely to correspond to unrecognized forms of rejection, we re-analyzed a liver tissue microarray dataset derived from two immunosuppression withdrawal trials previously reported by our group, which contained expression data from 20 pairs of liver biopsies obtained before drug weaning was initiated and at the time of rejection.11

A gene classifier of T cell mediated rejection was identified using predictive analysis of microarrays (PAM).

Of note, 7 of the 20 biopsy pairs were obtained from patients who had chronic hepatitis caused by HCV at the time of initiating drug withdrawal.11

All samples were analyzed together to be able to develop classifiers that would identify rejection on top of underlying inflammatory lesions.

The diagnostic accuracy of the resulting rejection-associated signature was evaluated by fourfold cross-validation, in which the original sample is randomly partitioned into four equal size subsamples.

Of the four subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining three subsamples are used as training data, and the procedure is repeated 40 times.

Results

SECTION

Patients’ characteristics

PARAGRAPH

Between January 1988 and December 1999, 654 LTs were performed in 589 patients at Hospital Clinic Barcelona.

At the time of initiating the study (December 2007), 312 patients were dead and 38 were lost to follow-up.

One hundred eighteen patients were excluded because of a previous diagnosis of recurrent liver disease or chronic rejection.

Among the 121 evaluable patients, 67 were finally included in the study and underwent a surveillance liver biopsy between December 2007 and December 2009.

The remaining 54 patients were excluded for the presence of severe co-morbidities, contraindications for a liver biopsy, or refused consent (Fig. 1).

The characteristics of the patients enrolled in the study are shown (Table 1).

Briefly, the majority of patients were male (n = 52, 77.6%), with a median age (at the time of liver biopsy) of 60.4 years (29.5–75.5).

The median time from LT to liver biopsy was 13 years (10–22).

The most common indication for LT was alcoholic cirrhosis (n = 23, 34%).

The most frequent maintenance immunosuppressive regimen at the time of biopsy was based on cyclosporine (53.8%; n = 36).

Independently of the immunosuppressive regimen, all patients had low immunosuppressive drug levels (below the limit of quantification in 12 [18%] patients) at the time of liver biopsy.

Following the performance of the surveillance liver biopsy, enrolled patients underwent routine follow-up clinical visits every six months for a median time of 6.8 [range 2–10] years.

During the follow-up, 11 patients died (five died of cardiovascular complications, three of neoplasms, two died of end-stage liver disease, and one patient died of respiratory tract infection) and four patients were lost to follow-up.

SECTION

Histological evaluation

PARAGRAPH

The results of the central histological analysis are shown (Table 2).

Histological abnormalities were detected in 51 (76%) liver biopsies.

Six patients (9%) had cirrhosis, five (8%) had chronic rejection and eight (12%) patients had moderate to severe hepatic steatosis.

The most frequently observed histological abnormality was portal inflammation, present in 45 biopsies (67%).

Sixteen (35%) out of the 45 patients exhibited moderate to severe portal inflammation with interface hepatitis in 11 patients.

Patients with portal inflammation were negative for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and hepatitis E serological markers.

While 11 of the 45 patients with moderate to severe portal inflammation displayed positive antinuclear antibodies and/or anti-smooth muscle antibodies in titers ranging between 1:40 to 1:640, none of them met criteria of the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group for the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis.

Furthermore, auto-antibodies were also positive in 27 patients with no evidence of significant portal inflammation.

Of note, 32 (71%) out of the 45 patients with portal inflammation had portal or perisinusoidal fibrosis (four of these patients had cirrhosis).

On the contrary, among the 22 patients without portal inflammation, only seven (32%) had portal or perisinusoidal fibrosis (p = 0.02).

By ordinal logistic regression analysis, we observed that the severity of inflammation was significantly associated with the severity of portal fibrosis.

The odds of portal fibrosis in patients with moderate or severe inflammation were 6.5 (95% CI 1.48–28.17; p = 0.013) and 15.2 (95% CI 1.34–172.18; p = 0.028), respectively, when compared to the absence of inflammation.

Centrilobular fibrosis was observed in five patients, all of whom exhibited moderate to marked portal inflammation, although concomitant portal fibrosis (F1) was only apparent in one patient.

PARAGRAPH

There were no significant differences among patients with or without portal inflammation regarding the type and trough levels of immunosuppressive drugs, liver tests, or LSMs neither at the time of the protocol liver biopsy nor at the last follow-up visit.

When specifically analyzing the group of patients with portal inflammation, there were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics between patients with or without portal/perisinusoidal fibrosis.

The only variable significantly associated with the presence of fibrosis was LSM, which was significantly higher in patients with fibrosis than in patients without fibrosis (11.8 vs. 4.8 kPa; p = 0.049).

SECTION

Identification of gene expression modules associated with histological abnormalities

PARAGRAPH

To explore the mechanisms potentially driving the histological abnormalities observed in the protocol biopsies, we employed WGCNA to identify modules of genes whose expression is coordinated in a similar manner across the whole group of samples.

We summarized the results in a correlation heatmap, in which the Y-axis corresponds to groups of genes (modules) with similar expression, and the x-axis includes the clinical, serological and histological variables of interest (Fig. 2).

We chose to focus on two specific modules, named Cyan and Pink, containing 102 and 425 genes respectively, because they showed the most significant positive correlation with portal inflammation, the most prevalent histological abnormality, as well as with interface activity and portal fibrosis, which are considered markers of progressive histological damage (Fig. 2 and Table S1).

The Pink module was most significantly enriched in KEGG canonical pathways involved in extracellular matrix remodeling (Table S2).

In contrast, among the genes contained in the Cyan module we identified an over-representation of KEGG canonical pathways known to be regulated by IFNγ, as well as ATAGC PBT gene sets previously reported to be associated with T cell mediated rejection (Table S3).

These results suggested a potential link between active portal inflammation, fibrosis and T cell mediated rejection.

SECTION

The gene expression module associated with portal inflammation overlaps with the transcriptional signature observed at the time of T cell mediated rejection

PARAGRAPH

To further explore whether the subclinical portal inflammatory lesions might correspond to unrecognized forms of rejection, we defined a transcriptional signature of T cell mediated rejection (TCMR) by re-analyzing the previously reported microarray gene expression data derived from 20 liver transplant recipients who developed rejection while undergoing protocolized immunosuppression withdrawal.11

Using PAM on the gene expression profiles derived from the 20 pairs of liver biopsies (i.e. collected before initiating drug weaning and at the time of rejection), we identified a parsimonious group of 13 genes that classified samples as either rejecting or non-rejecting with high accuracy (Fig. 3A and B and Table S4).

We interrogated the RNASeq expression dataset from the protocol biopsy set and noted a significant correlation between the eigengenes of the group of 13 genes and those of the Cyan and Pink gene expression modules (Fig. 3C).

PARAGRAPH

To better understand the biological implications of the changes in the expression of these two modules, we decided to concentrate on those samples exhibiting extreme transcriptional phenotypes.

To do so, we assigned biopsies into two groups, Cyan&Pink_High and Cyan&Pink_Low, according to whether their expression levels were above or below the median level of expression for both modules.

We then compared the enrichment in rejection-associated gene sets between the transcriptome of the Cyan&Pink_High group and the groups of post-transplant biopsies with chronic hepatitis C, early TCMR and late TCMR, employing the Cyan&Pink_Low group as the common comparator for all groups.

To conduct this analysis we used the QuSAGE method, which allows direct two-way comparisons between several groups of samples.

The Cyan&Pink_High group transcriptome was significantly enriched in a number of KEGG canonical pathways associated with allograft rejection and immunopathology (Table 3).

Furthermore, among the ATAGC PBT gene sets, the following gene sets known to be associated with TCMR were also upregulated in the Cyan&Pink_High group: QCAT (cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated transcripts), QCMAT (macrophage transcripts associated with rejection), GRIT1 (IFNg dependent rejection-associated transcripts), AMAT1 (alternative macrophage associated transcripts correlating with TCMR), ENDAT (endothelial cell associated transcripts), BAT (B cell associated transcripts), IRITD3 and IRITD5 (injury and rejection-associated transcripts).

A direct comparison between the transcriptional profile of the TCMR, late TCMR, and Cyan&Pink_High groups revealed that they were very similar at a functional pathway level, with analogous enrichment scores with regards to immunopathology pathways and rejection-associated gene sets.

In contrast, the transcriptomes of these three groups differed from the transcriptional profile observed in the chronic hepatitis C group, in which, with the exception of the GRIT1 and BAT gene sets, no significant enrichment in rejection-associated transcript sets was noted (Table 3).

The potential for progressive liver damage was investigated by quantifying the enrichment in a set of 122 genes preferentially expressed by liver stellate cells and known to be correlated with the extent of liver fibrosis and with the survival of patients with liver cirrhosis.18

Over-representation of this gene set was only noted on the Cyan&Pink_High expression module (Table 3).

SECTION

Clinical parameters associated with liver tissue gene expression changes

PARAGRAPH

We next investigated whether the transcriptional differences between the Cyan&Pink_High and Cyan&Pink_Low groups were translated into changes in clinically-relevant biochemical and hematological parameters, either at baseline (at the time of the index protocol biopsy) or at the last follow-up visit.

At baseline, Cyan&Pink_High patients had significantly higher INR and APRI fibrosis score values than the Cyan&Pink_Low patients (p = 0.032 and 0.014, respectively; Table S5).

Furthermore, they showed more advanced portal inflammation, interface hepatitis and portal fibrosis (Table S5).

At the last follow-up visit, compared to patients in the Cyan&Pink_Low group, patients from the Cyan&Pink_High group continued to have a significantly higher APRI score and in addition they exhibited higher FIB-4 fibrosis score, AST and bilirubin, and lower platelet count (Table S5).

To better understand the significance of the changes observed during patient follow-up, and to clarify whether Cyan&Pink group assignment exerted an effect that was independent from the changes seen at baseline, we re-analyzed the data employing a non-parametric ANCOVA adjusted by the length of the follow-up.

This confirmed the significant association between Cyan&Pink_High group assignment and the development of higher bilirubin level (p = 0.0475), lower platelet count (p = 0.0025), higher ALT (p = 0.0124), and higher APRI score (p = 0.0277), at the end of follow-up (Table 4).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

It is now well established that subclinical chronic allograft injury is very prevalent in LT recipients surviving long-term.

Previous studies have reported histological abnormalities in 5% to 90% of late protocol liver biopsies.

In children, the prevalence appears to be higher, ranging between 67% and 95%.6,7,21

The reasons for this variability are not entirely clear but they are probably related to differences in the indications for transplantation, follow-up duration, immunosuppression protocols, and thresholds for liver test levels.1,19,20

In most studies, portal inflammation with or without interface activity and/or fibrosis, often referred to as idiopathic post-transplant hepatitis, was the most frequent finding.6,7,20,19,21–24

PARAGRAPH

The objective of our study was to investigate the mechanisms associated with subclinical graft deterioration by conducting an unbiased analysis of clinical, histological, biochemical and high-throughput liver tissue transcriptional data.

In particular, we questioned whether biopsies displaying idiopathic post-transplant hepatitis corresponded to unrecognized forms of rejection.

To reduce the risk of bias, provide adequate clinical context and ensure the generalizability of the observations, we designed a prospective study in which we interrogated all patients transplanted at Hospital Clinic Barcelona over a 10-year period and we conducted protocol liver biopsies in those meeting pre-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria.

PARAGRAPH

We first employed an exploratory systems biology strategy to identify, in an unsupervised manner, the key mechanistic underpinnings of the histology lesions.

This was conducted using a modular analysis that explored the correlations between groups of co-expressed genes and semi-quantitative histological scores across the whole set of liver tissue samples.

Out of the 23 modules of genes identified, we selected two for further analyses, based on their significant correlation with portal inflammation and fibrosis.

By representing each of the two expression modules by an ‘eigengene’ we could show a significant correlation between the modules and a 13-gene set specific for TCMR in LT that we derived from a re-analysis of two previously published microarray studies conducted by our group.10,11

Furthermore, the two modules were enriched in gene sets previously identified as being associated with allograft rejection across a variety of experimental and clinical settings, which again closely resembled what is observed at the time of clinically apparent early and late TCMR.

PARAGRAPH

A non-rejection-related form of liver allograft inflammation (recurrent HCV-induced chronic hepatitis) also exhibited transcriptional similarities with rejection.

This reflects the sharing of specific pathways of tissue injury between rejection and other inflammatory insults, and is in keeping with what has been described in kidney transplantation.25

However, the degree of overlap observed between TCMR and HCV-induced chronic hepatitis was significantly smaller than between TCMR and the subset of protocol biopsies exhibiting high expression of the two selected modules.

PARAGRAPH

Although our study lacked paired longitudinal liver biopsies and thus was not designed to evaluate the histological progression of allograft damage, the analysis of the blood tests collected over time revealed that patients with high expression of the two selected gene modules exhibited a mild but significant worsening in non-invasive markers of fibrosis, liver function and portal hypertension.

This was consistent with the over-expression of a distinct set of genes known to be specific for stellate cells and whose expression in the liver tissue of non-transplant patients with chronic liver disease has been reported to be associated with liver failure and patient survival.18

Taken together, these data suggest that idiopathic post-transplant hepatitis is likely to constitute a form of unrecognized alloimmune injury that, at least in a subset of patients, results in progressive allograft damage.

PARAGRAPH

Previous studies have reported an association between circulating donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) and subclinical liver allograft inflammatory lesions.9,26–29

The influence of DSA on the liver tissue gene expression profile could not be explored in our study because of the lack of donor HLA information.

The fact that the gene modules correlated with portal inflammation and interface activity closely resembled the transcriptome of liver TCMR would argue against a significant role for antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) in this setting.

It should be acknowledged, however, that in kidney transplantation the transcriptional profile of TCMR and ABMR are known to significantly overlap,25 and that transcripts specific for ABMR in LT have not been defined yet.

Hence, our study cannot unambiguously elucidate the relative roles of cellular and humoral alloimmunity.

This will require the performance of transcriptional studies of large numbers of accurately classified TCMR and ABMR cases.

PARAGRAPH

The majority of patients enrolled in the current study were on very low dose immunosuppression.

This reflects the standard practice at Hospital Clinic Barcelona and was not the result of an intentional drug minimization protocol.

Our findings could be interpreted as indicating that long-term surviving liver transplant recipients are insufficiently immunosuppressed.

This interpretation needs to be balanced against the significant morbidity and mortality caused by immunosuppressive medications and the fact that evidences of progressive allograft damage were only noted in a minority of the patients enrolled in our study.

Hence, we would caution against the use of more aggressive immunosuppressive regimens in this patient population until randomized controlled trials investigating the risk/benefit of these regimens are conducted.

In the meantime, the main practical lesson to be drawn from our data is the need to recognize the possibility of subclinical rejection in LT recipients surviving long-term, with normal liver function tests, and to consider sequential surveillance liver biopsies as a tool that could potentially optimize graft and patient survival.
