TITLE

Hepatitis B virus genome recycling and de novo secondary infection events maintain stable cccDNA levels

PARAGRAPH

Using a unique hepatocellular model system designed to support viral growth, we demonstrate that hepatitis B virus (HBV) has remarkably slow infection kinetics.

Establishment of the episomal transcription template and the persistent form of the virus, so called covalently closed circular DNA, as well as viral transcription and protein expression all take a long time.

Once established, HBV maintains a stable pool of covalently closed circular DNA via intracellular recycling of HBV genomes and through infection of na√Øve cells by newly formed virions.
