TITLE

Targeting the crosstalk between cytokine-induced killer cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in hepatocellular carcinoma

PARAGRAPH

Cytokine-induced killer cells are a mixture of immune cells given to eliminate cancer cells.

However, not all patients respond to this treatment.

Herein, we show in 2 different liver cancer models that myeloid-derived suppressor cells are increased in response to cytokine-induced killer cell therapy.

Targeting these myeloid-derived suppressor cells may provide an additional therapeutic benefit alongside cytokine-induced killer cell therapy.
