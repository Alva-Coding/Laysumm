TITLE

Resistance analysis in patients with genotype 1–6 HCV infection treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in the phase III studies

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global health burden with an estimated 71–150 million individuals infected worldwide.1–3

Development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in recent years has dramatically enhanced sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in HCV genotype (GT)1 chronically infected patients.4

PARAGRAPH

HCV is classified into seven confirmed genotypes and 67 subtypes.5

GT1 is the most prevalent HCV genotype worldwide and accounts for approximately 46% of chronic HCV infection globally.

GT3 accounts for about 30% of chronic HCV infections, followed by GT2, 4, and 6 accounting for 23% of HCV cases; and GT5 accounting for <1%.6

GT7 has so far only been identified in a few patient isolates.13

While GT1 and 3 dominate in most countries irrespective of economic status, the largest proportions of GT4 and 5 are in lower-income countries.

The development of pan-genotypic treatments with high efficacy and tolerability across genotypes, irrespective of degree of fibrosis, will be necessary to make an impact on global disease prevalence, especially in regions with high genotype diversity where HCV genotyping and fibrosis staging are not part of routine medical care for HCV infection.

PARAGRAPH

The non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) of HCV is an essential viral protein that plays roles in both viral RNA replication and the assembly of HCV virions7 and may promote infection by interfering with host innate immunity.8

Velpatasvir is a novel second generation HCV NS5A inhibitor that has demonstrated potent antiviral activity in vitro against GT1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 replicons and in patients with GT1, 2, 3, or 4 HCV infection in a three-day monotherapy study.9

The fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) was highly efficacious in patients infected with HCV GT1–6 in the ASTRAL studies.10,11

When compared with first-generation NS5A inhibitors, velpatasvir not only demonstrates broad genotypic coverage of HCV isolates, but also improved potency against many known NS5A resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) that confer reduced susceptibility to first-generation NS5A inhibitors.9

Given the high levels of NS5A variation across genotypes and subtypes, particularly at known NS5A RAS positions, and the high prevalence of baseline NS5A RAS observed in many HCV genotypes, there is a need to understand the potential impact of NS5A RASs on treatment outcome in patients treated with regimens containing next generation NS5A inhibitors.

Here we describe the genotype diversity of HCV isolates from patients treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks in the ASTRAL 1, 2, 3, and 5 as well as POLARIS-2 and 3 studies.

We also evaluated the prevalence and impact of baseline RASs on treatment outcome and emergence of RASs at virologic relapse in patients from these studies.

All studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and local regulatory requirements.

All patients provided written informed consent.

SECTION

Study population

PARAGRAPH

Resistance analyses were conducted for six phase III clinical studies evaluating treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks in patients chronically infected HCV GT1 through GT6 (GS–US–342–1138 [ASTRAL–1]), GS–US–342–1139 [ASTRAL–2], GS–US–342–1140 [ASTRAL–3], GS-US-342–1202 [ASTRAL-5], GS-US-367–1172 [POLARIS-2] and GS-US-367–1173 [POLARIS-3]).

Patients that were enrolled in the placebo treatment arm in ASTRAL-1 study and subsequently treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks in study GS-US-342-1446 were also included in this analysis.

Integrated resistance analyses were performed.

Patients with chronic HCV GT1 through GT6 infection received a fixed-dose combination tablet containing 400 mg of sofosbuvir and 100 mg of velpatasvir, administered orally once daily for 12 weeks without the addition of ribavirin.

PARAGRAPH

Detailed descriptions of ASTRAL-1–3, ASTRAL-5 and POLARIS-2–3 have been published previously10–13 and are described briefly below.

The ASTRAL studies were conducted in 10 countries including the USA, Canada, Germany, UK, Italy, France, Belgium, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and Australia.

ASTRAL-5 was conducted in the USA and evaluated sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment in patients with HCV/HIV co-infection.

In ASTRAL-1, patients with GT1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 were enrolled.

Nineteen percent of patients had compensated cirrhosis and 32% had received previous unsuccessful treatment for HCV (28% had received a regimen of peginterferon, ribavirin, and a protease inhibitor, and 61% had received peginterferon and ribavirin).

In ASTRAL-2 and ASTRAL-3, patients with GT2 and GT3 were enrolled, respectively.

In ASTRAL-1, fourteen percent of patients in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir group had compensated cirrhosis and 14% had received previous unsuccessful treatment of HCV.

In ASTRAL-3, thirty percent of patients in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir group had compensated cirrhosis and 26% had received previous unsuccessful treatment of HCV.

In ASTRAL-5, patients with GT1–4 were enrolled.

Eighteen percent of patients in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir group had compensated cirrhosis and 29% had received previous unsuccessful treatment of HCV.

The POLARIS studies were conducted in USA, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand, UK and Australia.

POLARIS-2 evaluated sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment in patients with any HCV GT except patients with GT3 infections and compensated cirrhosis.

Nineteen percent of patients in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir group had compensated cirrhosis and 23% had received previous unsuccessful treatment of HCV (81% had received pegylated interferon plus ribavirin).

POLARIS-3 evaluated sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/ voxilaprevir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment in patients with GT3 and compensated cirrhosis.

Twenty-nine percent of patients in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir group had received previous unsuccessful treatment of HCV (94% had received pegylated interferon plus ribavirin).

PARAGRAPH

For the purpose of the subtype and resistance analyses described here, only patients who completed sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment for 12 weeks and had virologic outcome were included (n = 1,778).

A total of 19 patients with virologic outcome of “other” were excluded from this analysis: 16 patients in ASTRAL-1–3 studies and three patients in ASTRAL-5.10,11

In addition, three patients who had reinfection post-treatment were also excluded from the data set.

SECTION

Laboratory assessments

PARAGRAPH

HCV RNA was determined at a central laboratory using COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV Quantitative Test, version 2.0 (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Pleasanton, CA) with a lower limit of quantitation of 15 IU/ml.

HCV genotype was determined using VERSANT® HCV Genotype 2.0 assay (LiPA) or by TRUGENE® (both Siemens, Munich, Germany) or by Abbott RealTime HCV Genotype II assay (Abbott, Illinois, USA).

This information was used to select primers for amplification of non-structural protein 3 (NS3), NS5A and NS5B genes for baseline samples.

A final subtype for virology analyses at baseline and post-treatment were assigned by measuring the quality of an amino acid alignment of consensus sequences obtained from deep sequencing for each sample sequence against a curated set of reference sequences encompassing all known HCV subtypes.

This set of reference sequences consists of 67 subtypes and 7 genotypes (hcvsubtypereferenceset.fasta).

Based on BLAST (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) analyses against this HCV subtype reference set, the subtypes were determined as follows.

The subtype of the reference sequence with the highest homology is assigned to the sample if the amino acid alignment of a protein results in a greater than 85% amino acid identity.

If multiple targets were sequenced, and the subtype analysis results in multiple subtypes having highest homology over 85% identity, all subtypes are assigned to the sample.

Phylogenetic analyses were performed to confirm results of BLAST analyses.

SECTION

Sequencing analyses and RAS detection

PARAGRAPH

Deep sequencing of full-length NS5A and NS5B was performed on available plasma samples with HCV RNA ≥1,000 IU/ml for all patients at baseline and for post-treatment time points for patients experiencing virologic failure.

Deep sequencing was performed by DDL Diagnostic Laboratory (Rijswijk, The Netherlands) using the Illumina MiSeq deep sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA).

Each gene was amplified using genotype-specific proprietary amplification primers and standard reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology.

Library preparation, multiplexing and deep sequencing were then performed.

Illumina-based deep sequencing chemistry with paired ends was used with read lengths of 150 bases.

Deep sequencing data was split into one file per sample using only 100% matched barcodes to bin the reads.

Sequence analysis was performed using internally developed software in a stepwise fashion.

Briefly, raw reads from the FASTQ files were trimmed and filtered based on quality scores and read length.

Trimming was carried out on reads when the quality score decreased below 15, and reads shorter than 50 nucleotides were removed.

Deep sequencing data was aligned using MOSAIK v1.1.0017.

All aligned reads were then translated in-frame and changes from a reference sequence were determined.

Assay sensitivity and assay background cut-offs were evaluated based on plasmid and RNA controls.

Prevalence of NS5A class and velpatasvir-specific RASs and effects on SVR12 were evaluated at 15% sequencing assay cut-offs as it was shown previously that a 15% assay cut-off is the most representative in the evaluation of NS5A RASs effect on treatment outcome.14

Substitutions were reported as differences compared with a genotype-specific reference strain (HCV1a_H77_NC_004102, HCV1b_Con1_AJ238799, HCV2a_JFH1_AB047639, HCV2b_MD2b10_AY232748, HCV3_S52_GU814263, HCV4_ED43_GU814265, HCV5a_SA13_AF064490, and HCV6a_EUHK2_Y12083).

RASs are defined as substitutions that confer reduced susceptibility to any approved NS5A inhibitor with >2.5-fold change compared with an HCV GT-specific reference (HCV1a H77 NC AF009606, HCV1b Con1 AJ238799, HCV2a JFH1 AB047639, HCV2b MD2b10 AY232748, HCV3 S52 GU814263, HCV4E D43 GU814265, HCV5a SA13 AF064490, HCV6a EUHK2 Y12083, respectively).

Here we divided the NS5A RASs into NS5A class RAS and velpatasvir-specific RASs, as summarized (Table 1).

Mutant viral load was determined by multiplication of total HCV viral load by the fraction of the mutant viral population.

PARAGRAPH

The NS5B NI class RAS that are reported here included the following substitutions in NS5B: S96T, N142T, L159F, E237G, S282any, C289I/L, L320F/I/V, and V321A/I.

SECTION

Analyzing the susceptibility of NS5A RASs to velpatasvir

PARAGRAPH

Susceptibility of NS5A site-directed mutants or NS5A patient isolates to velpatasvir was tested in transient transfections as previously described,15 performed in GT1–6 replicons.

Briefly, NS5A mutations were introduced into a plasmid encoding the PI-hRluc replicon by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange II XL mutagenesis kit, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

For patient isolates, NS5A was amplified using High Fidelity PCR master kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) as directed by the manufacturer.

PCR products were purified and digested with 3U/µg of AseI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), according to supplier’s recommendation.

The PCR digest was ligated with a shuttle vector.

The ligated product was transformed by electroporation into ElectroTen-Blue cells (Strategene, La Jolla, CA) according to supplier’s recommendations.

The plasmid DNA was extracted and linearized by digestion with ScaI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA).

Replicon RNAs were transcribed in vitro from replicon-encoding plasmids using a MEGAscript kit (Ambion, Austin, TX).

RNA was transfected into Huh-lunet cells using the method of Lohmann et al.16 Briefly, cells were trypsinized and washed twice with PBS.

A suspension of cells was mixed with RNA and subjected to electroporation.

Cells were transferred into 40 ml of pre-warmed culture medium and then seeded into 96-well plates (100 μl/well).

Compounds were diluted in 100% DMSO and added to cells.

Cells were treated for three days, after which culture media were removed, cells were lysed, and Renilla luciferase activity was quantified using a commercially available assay (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Top Count instrument (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA).

EC50 values were calculated as the compound concentration at which a 50% reduction in the level of Renilla reporter activity was observed when compared with control samples with DMSO.

Dose-response curves and EC50 values were generated using GraphPad Prism software package (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) by nonlinear regression analysis.

The replication level of either reference strains (1b-Con1 or 1a-H77) or chimeric replicons derived transiently from isolates was determined as the ratio of the Renilla luciferase signal at Day 4 to that at 4 h post-electroporation, to normalize for transfection efficiency.

The replication capacity of each replicon was expressed as their normalized replication efficiency compared with that of the reference strain within the same experiment.

HCV subtypes in patients treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir

PARAGRAPH

In ASTRAL-1, -2, -3, -5 and POLARIS-2 and -3, 1,778 patients with chronic HCV infection were treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks and had virologic outcome.

The viral genotype and subtype were determined at screening by the LiPA/TRUGENE/Abbott assay.

Subsequent availability of direct sequencing results from the viral NS5A and NS5B regions permitted confirmation or refinement of the LiPA/TRUGENE/Abbott screening genotype/subtype assignments.

The results showed that the LiPA/TRUGENE/Abbott genotyping method accurately determined HCV genotypes across GT1–6 with concordant genotyping results observed in 99% of patients by direct sequencing (Table 2).

However, the LiPA /TRUGENE/Abbott have limitations in their ability to determining HCV subtypes within a genotype (Table 2).

Based on sequencing results, 37 of 67 known HCV subtypes were treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (1a, 1b, 1e, 1h, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, 2i, 2j, 2k, 3a, 3b, 3g, 3k, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4f, 4g, 4k, 4n, 4o, 4r, 4t, 5a, 6a, 6e, 6h, 6k, 6l, 6m, 6n, 6q, 6v) as well as 18 novel or mixed HCV subtypes.

One patient was determined to have GT7 HCV as previously described.17

SECTION

SVR rate by HCV genotype/subtype

PARAGRAPH

Overall, 98.9% (1758/1778) of patients who completed treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks and had post treatment week 12 HCV RNA measured achieved SVR12 (Table 3).

For GT1, 99.0% (693/700) of patients infected with HCV achieved SVR12.

Seven patients with GT1 who did not achieve SVR12 were subtypes 1a (n = 5), 1b, and 1c/1h.

For GT2 and 6, a diverse population of 17 known subtypes and seven novel subtypes were evaluated in these studies and all achieved SVR12, including 316 patients with genotype 2 and 58 patients with genotype 6.

For patients with GT3-infection, 97.5% (466/478) achieved SVR12.

All six patients with GT3 infections and a non-GT3a subtype achieved SVR12 (GT3b n = 3, GT3g n = 2, and GT3k n = 1).

For GT4, a diverse population of 11 known subtypes and 11 novel subtypes were evaluated in these studies.

Of the patients with GT4 infections, 99.5% (196/197) achieved SVR12.

All 34 patients with GT5a infections achieved SVR12.

One patient was infected with GT7 HCV of novel subtype.

This patient achieved SVR12 and detailed information about this patient has been published previously.17

SECTION

Impact of baseline NS5A class RASs on sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment outcome

PARAGRAPH

The prevalence of baseline NS5A class RASs with reduced susceptibility to any NS5A inhibitor (Table 4) and their effect on treatment response to sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was evaluated.

In this analysis, only GT1–6 patients (n = 1,773) with available NS5A sequencing data were evaluated: 484 patients with GT1a, 205 with GT1b, 4 patients with GT1 other than GT1a or GT1b, 316 with GT2, 476 with GT3, 196 with GT4, 34 with GT5 and 58 with GT6.

In patients with GT1–6 infection treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks, the overall prevalence of baseline NS5A class RASs was 28% (493/1,773); with the lowest prevalence in GT5 (9%) and the highest in GT2 (61%), using a 15% sequencing assay cut-off (Table 4).

The presence of NS5A class RASs at baseline did not impact SVR12 rate in patients with GT1a, 1b, 2, 4, 5 or 6 infections; the SVR rate was 97% to 100% independent of the presence of NS5A class RASs, using a 15% sequencing assay cut-off.

There were four patients with GT1 infections that were not GT1a or GT1b, with a single patient not achieving SVR12.

PARAGRAPH

For the 476 patients with GT3 infections, 12% had NS5A class RASs at baseline, using a 15% sequencing assay cut-off.

A lower SVR rate was observed for patients with NS5A class RASs and GT3 infection; the SVR rate was 93% (53/57) and 98% (411/420) in patients with and without baseline NS5A class RASs.

The SVR rates in the presence of Y93H in patients with GT3 infections and cirrhosis was evaluated.

However, only 1.2% (6/476) of patients with GT3 were cirrhotic and harbored Y93H at baseline.

Four out of six of these patients achieved SVR after sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment.

In addition, the effect of each individual or combinations of class RASs on SVR12 rate was assessed for each genotype.

All class RASs observed as single or mutant combinations above 15% assay cut-off in the studied patient population are listed (Table 5).

SVR12 rates in patients with individual RASs were >95% for any RASs that were present in at least five patients, with the exception of Y93H in GT3.

The SVR12 rate in patients infected with GT3 with Y93H was 86% (19/22).

The SVR12 rate in patients infected with GT3 without Y93H was 98% (445/454) and 97% (34/35) with NS5A RASs other than Y93H.

SECTION

Impact of baseline velpatasvir-specific RASs on treatment outcome in patients treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks

PARAGRAPH

The prevalence of velpatasvir-specific RASs at baseline with reduced susceptibility to velpatasvir and effect on treatment response to sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was evaluated (Table 6).

in GT1–6, the overall prevalence of baseline NS5A velpatasvir-specific RASs was 8% (138/1,773); with the lowest prevalence in GT5 (0%) and the highest in GT6 (52%), using a 15% sequencing assay cut-off (Table 6).

The lower prevalence of NS5A velpatasvir-specific RAS compared to NS5A class RASs is due to the improved resistance barrier of velpatasvir.

The SVR rates were 93% to 100% in GT1–6 patients with velpatasvir-specific RASs and 98% to 100% in patients without velpatasvir-specific RASs, using a 15% sequencing assay cut-off.

PARAGRAPH

Y93H was the most prevalent NS5A RAS at baseline in patients with GT3 infection (4.6%, 22/476), and this RAS confers >700-fold reduced susceptibility to velpatasvir.

Patients with GT3 infection and Y93H at baseline had an SVR rate of 86% (19/22) compared to 98.0% (445/454) in patients without Y93H.

Furthermore, the number of viruses with Y93H per ml of plasma sample also called “Y93H viral load” was calculated as total HCV viral load multiplied by percent of Y93H in each sample with detectable Y93H above 1% and the effect of the Y93H viral load on SVR12 was evaluated (Fig. 1).

No differences in average Y93H viral load between patients who achieved SVR12 and those who experienced virologic failure were observed.

SECTION

Patients with virologic failure after sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment

PARAGRAPH

A total of 20 of 1,778 patients (1.1%) treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks experienced virologic failure: seven infected with GT1, 12 infected with GT3, and one infected with GT4 HCV (Table 7).

Phenotypic analysis was attempted for all mutants observed in patients with virologic failure using patient isolates or site-directed mutant replicons (Table 7).

For the five patients with GT1a-infection and virologic failure, no NS5A class or velpatasvir-specific RASs were observed (15% sequencing assay cut-off) at baseline.

At virologic failure, Y93N was observed as prevalent in the viral population in two of four patients.

Y93N confers 805-fold reduced susceptibility to velpatasvir, as measured in the patient isolates.

For the patient with GT1b infection and virologic failure, NS5A RASs L31M and Y93H were observed at baseline and maintained at failure.

The L31M and Y93H double-mutant in the GT1b replicon lead to a 44-fold reduced susceptibility to velpatasvir compared to the wild-type replicon.

The other patient who experienced a GT1 virologic failure had a novel GT1c/1h subtype and harbored two NS5A class RASs at baseline, Q30R + L31M.

At virologic failure, Y93H was also observed and this patient harbored the triple RASs Q30R (>99%) + L31M (88%) + Y93H (72%) with a 763-fold reduced susceptibility to velpatasvir as measured in the patient isolate.

No data are available on the susceptibility of these site-directed substitutions for this novel GT1c/1h subtype.

Of the 12 patients with GT3a-infection and virologic failure, four harbored velpatasvir-specific RASs at baseline; one harbored A30K (50-EC50 fold change), and three harbored Y93H (724-EC50 fold change) (Table 7).

At virologic failure, all 12 patients with GT3a-infection harbored Y93H at high abundance and the patient with A30K at baseline harbored A30K + Y93H at virologic failure.

One patient with GT4a infection did not harbor NS5A RASs at baseline or failure.

Additionally, analyses of velpatasvir-specific RASs were performed using 1% assay cut-off at virologic failure.

There were only two additional variants identified.

One patient with GT1a infection harbored Y93H (7.6%) in addition to already reported Y93N (91.9%).

The second variant L31I (2.8%) was identified in a patient with GT1c/1h in addition to Q30R (>99%) + L31M(88%) + Y93H(72%).

PARAGRAPH

The overall prevalence of Y93H/N across all genotypes was 2.8% (49/1773) at baseline and 84% (16/20) at virologic failure, respectively.

Only one patient with a GT1b infection had V321I NS5B NI RAS at baseline and virologic failure.

No sofosbuvir NS5B RASs were observed at baseline or virologic failure in these 20 patients (Table 7).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

HCV is characterized by a high genetic diversity.

To improve treatment success across genotypes, pan-genotypic HCV therapy with equally high potency across genotypes is needed.

Velpatasvir is a novel pan-genotypic NS5A inhibitor with potency across GT1 to GT6.

Treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir-containing regimens resulted in high SVR12 rates (≥95%) in patients with HCV GT1–6 across highly diverse HCV subtypes.

This study describes the prevalence of pre-existing NS5A RASs in patients infected with HCV GT1-6 and treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks in ASTRAL-1, 2, 3, 5, and POLARIS-2 and -3 studies, as well as the impact of these RASs on treatment outcome.

Detection of NS5A RASs was evaluated using 15% sequencing assay cut-off, as this cut-off was previously shown to be the most clinically relevant.14

PARAGRAPH

Overall, each HCV genotype tested in the phase III studies was represented by patients from multiple countries, showing that the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir regimen was investigated in patients with HCV originating from different geographic locations.

Distribution and prevalence of individual subtypes varied with geographic region, reflecting the patterns of endemic HCV infection around the world.

Moreover, the patient population was diverse, including DAA-naïve patients with or without cirrhosis and those who had received unsuccessful treatment previously.

Overall, the 12-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir regimen demonstrated high SVR rates.

PARAGRAPH

The viral genotype and subtype were determined by direct sequencing results from the viral NS5A and NS5B regions, permitting confirmation or refinement of the LiPA/TRUGENE/Abbott screening genotype/subtype assignments.

To date, this is a first report that uses deep sequencing analyses from phase III studies to demonstrate the genotypic and subtype diversity.

Based on the sequencing results, high SVR12 rates with the 12-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir regimen were demonstrated in a wide representation of known HCV subtypes, as well as novel/mixed subtypes including one patient with GT7, suggesting a possible utility of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for the treatment of HCV even when the HCV genotype is not known.

PARAGRAPH

The prevalence of baseline NS5A class RASs that do not confer resistance to velpatasvir, but do confer resistance to other NS5A inhibitors differed among genotypes, with a higher prevalence in GT2 (61%) and GT4 (60%) compared to other genotypes.

Velpatasvir is active against many RASs that confer resistance to first-generation NS5A inhibitors.18

The improved resistance barrier of velpatasvir allowed high rates of SVR despite the presence of these NS5A class RASs at baseline.

The prevalence of velpatasvir-specific RASs was lower compared to NS5A class RASs, consistent with the improved in vitro resistance profile of velpatasvir.

For example, the prevalence of velpatasvir-specific RASs in patients with GT2 and GT4 infection was ≤2% compared with a prevalence of 60% for NS5A class RASs in these genotypes.

Despite the presence of NS5A class RASs or velpatasvir-specific RASs at baseline, virologic failure was rare among patients treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks; an effect of baseline NS5A RASs on treatment outcome was only apparent in patients with GT3a-infection.

Overall, the SVR rate for patients with GT3-infection was 93% and 98% in patients with or without baseline velpatasvir-specific RASs, respectively.

At baseline, Y93H was observed in 4.6% (22/476) of patients with GT3-infection conferring >700-fold reduced susceptibility to velpatasvir.

Patients with GT3-infection and Y93H at baseline had an SVR12 rate of 86% (19/22) after treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks; whereas patients with GT3-infection and baseline Y93H who were treated with sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir for 12 weeks in the ALLY-3 study had an SVR12 rate of 54% (7/13).19

The overall prevalence of Y93H/N at baseline across GT1–6 was low (2.6%) and only showed reduced treatment responses among those with GT3-infection.

However, in the few patients experiencing virologic failure, 17 of 20 patients harbored Y93H/N at virologic failure, either pre-existing at baseline or emergent.

Y93H/N in GT1a and GT3 confers cross-resistance to other NS5A inhibitors, conferring >100-fold resistance to daclatasvir, ombitasvir and elbasvir.20–22

PARAGRAPH

Importantly, no resistance to sofosbuvir was observed in patients with virologic failure after sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment, thus sofosbuvir-containing regimens, possibly including a novel pan-genotypic protease inhibitor such as voxilaprevir (GS-9857) or others, could be a possible retreatment option for patients who failed sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.

PARAGRAPH

Taken together, treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks was effective across highly diverse HCV subtypes.

Velpatasvir shows a higher barrier to resistance compared with first-generation NS5A inhibitors consistent with the improved in vitro resistance profile.

Pre-existing NS5A RASs had no impact on treatment outcome, except for patients with GT3a infection, where a slightly lower SVR rate was observed in patients with the NS5A RAS Y93H at baseline.

Most of the few patients who experienced virologic failure after treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks had single class resistance to NS5A inhibitor velpatasvir, but not to the NS5B inhibitor sofosbuvir, allowing for a possible retreatment with sofosbuvir-containing regimens.
