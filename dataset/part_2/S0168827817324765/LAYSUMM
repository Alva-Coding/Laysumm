TITLE

Resistance analysis in patients with genotype 1–6 HCV infection treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in the phase III studies

PARAGRAPH

Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir taken once daily for 12 weeks resulted in high sustained virologic response rates in patients infected with HCV, irrespective of the presence of NS5A resistance-associated variants prior to treatment.

Single class NS5A inhibitor resistance, but not sofosbuvir resistance, was detected in the few patients with virologic failure.

These data highlight the high barrier to resistance of this regimen for the treatment of chronic HCV across all genotypes in the vast majority of patients.
