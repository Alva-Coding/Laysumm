TITLE

Hepatocyte-specific suppression of microRNA-221-3p mitigates liver fibrosis

PARAGRAPH

Liver fibrosis majorly contributes to mortality resulting from various liver diseases.

We discovered a small RNA known as miRNA-221-3p, whose downregulation in hepatocytes results in reduced liver fibrosis.

Thus, inhibition of miRNA-221-3p may serve as one of the therapeutic approaches for treatment of liver fibrosis.
