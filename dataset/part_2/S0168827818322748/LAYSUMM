Modified PAGE-B score predicts the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in Asians with chronic hepatitis B on antiviral therapy

PARAGRAPH

PAGE-B scores and Toronto HCC risk index were developed to predict the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Caucasian patients with CHB under potent antiviral therapy.

This study validated these two scores in Asian patients with CHB and suggested that modified PAGE-B scores could improve the predictive performance.

A modified PAGE-B score, which is based only on a patient’s age, gender, baseline platelet counts, and serum albumin levels at treatment initiation, represents a reliable and easily available risk score to predict HCC development during the first five years of antiviral treatment in Asian patients with CHB.

With a scoring range from 0 to 21 points, a modified PAGE-B score differentiates the HCC risk.

A modified PAGE-B score significantly differentiates the five-year HCC risk: low ≤8 points and high ≥13 points.
