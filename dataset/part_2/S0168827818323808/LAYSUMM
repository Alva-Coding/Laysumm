TITLE

Small molecule-mediated reprogramming of human hepatocytes into bipotent progenitor cells

PARAGRAPH

Human primary hepatocytes were reprogrammed towards hepatic progenitor cells by a combined treatment with 2 small molecules, A83-01 and CHIR99021, and HGF.

Chemically derived hepatic progenitors exhibited a high proliferation potential and the ability to differentiate into hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells both in vitro and in vivo.

This approach enables the generation of patient-specific hepatic progenitors and provides a platform for personal and stem cell-based regenerative medicine.
