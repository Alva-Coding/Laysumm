ABSTRACT

TITLE

Claudin-3 regulates bile canalicular paracellular barrier and cholesterol gallstone core formation in mice

PARAGRAPH

Most cholesterol gallstones have a core consisting of inorganic and/or organic calcium salts, although the mechanisms of core formation are poorly understood.

We examined whether the paracellular permeability of ions at hepatic tight junctions is involved in the core formation of cholesterol gallstones, with particular interest in the role of phosphate ion, a common food additive and preservative.

PARAGRAPH

We focused on claudin-3 (Cldn3), a paracellular barrier-forming tight junction protein whose expression in mouse liver decreases with age.

Since Cldn3-knockout mice exhibited gallstone diseases, we used them to assess the causal relationship between paracellular phosphate ion permeability and the core formation of cholesterol gallstones.

PARAGRAPH

In the liver of Cldn3-knockout mice, the paracellular phosphate ion permeability through hepatic tight junctions was significantly increased, resulting in calcium phosphate core formation.

Cholesterol overdose caused cholesterol gallstone disease in these mice.

PARAGRAPH

We revealed that in the hepatobiliary system, Cldn3 functions as a paracellular barrier for phosphate ions, to help maintain biliary ion homeostasis.

We provide in vivo evidence that elevated phosphate ion concentrations play a major role in the lifestyle- and age-related risks of developing cholesterol gallstone disease under cholesterol overdose.
