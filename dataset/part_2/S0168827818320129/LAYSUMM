TITLE

β-Hydroxybutyrate protects from alcohol-induced liver injury via a Hcar2-cAMP dependent pathway

PARAGRAPH

Alcoholic hepatitis is a life-threatening condition with no approved therapy that occurs unexpectedly in people who consume excess alcohol.

The liver makes many metabolites, and we demonstrate that loss of one such metabolite β-hydroxybutyrate occurs in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

This loss can increase alcohol-induced liver injury, and β-hydroxybutyrate can protect from alcohol-induced liver injury via a receptor on liver macrophages.

This opens the possibility of metabolite-based therapy for alcoholic hepatitis.
