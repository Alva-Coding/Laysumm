TITLE

β-Hydroxybutyrate protects from alcohol-induced liver injury via a Hcar2-cAMP dependent pathway

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Excess alcohol intake has many effects on the liver and can present with several clinical syndromes.1

One of the most serious is acute alcoholic hepatitis (AH), which occurs unexpectedly after decades of high levels of alcohol consumption, and is characterized by sterile liver inflammation, jaundice and can progress to a systemic inflammatory response.2

There is a mixed inflammatory infiltrate characterized by neutrophils, and upregulation of a variety of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6.

Due to the ubiquitous development of hepatocyte steatosis there has been sustained interest in aspects of mitochondrial function related to lipid metabolism, particularly mitochondrial β-oxidation.3

In vivo and in vitro models have shown diverse effects of alcohol on mitochondrial biology including abnormal mitochondrial morphology (giant mitochondria), mitochondrial DNA fragmentation, deceased mitochondrial protein synthesis by inhibition of mitochondrial ribosome activity, and oxidation of mitochondrial proteins.3

Measurement of the steps in β-oxidation has demonstrated inhibition after acute and chronic alcohol exposure, which is caused by downregulation of genes involved in fatty acid uptake as well as oxidation.4,5

PARAGRAPH

To understand the factors that initiate AH a variety of pro-inflammatory changes have been identified, with data supporting a role for increased intestinal permeability allowing bacterial products to enter the hepatic circulation and initiate an inflammatory response.6

A compatible hypothesis is that toxic-metabolic injury to hepatocytes from alcohol results in the release of intracellular molecules generically termed damage associated molecular patterns which initiate, and can then establish a pro-inflammatory loop.7

There has been much less attention devoted to identifying the opposite, and equally plausible, scenario of a reduction in anti-inflammatory pathways resulting in AH.

As described above, many types of mitochondrial changes induced by alcohol have been identified, but at present there is no link between changes in mitochondrial metabolites and liver inflammation.

These considerations raised the possibility that if some of the usual products of mitochondrial metabolism have anti-inflammatory activity, with increasing mitochondrial damage their loss may trigger AH.

We focused on the reduction in β-oxidation by alcohol, because one of the products of β-oxidation is β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB).

BHB is of interest because in addition to being an energy source, it is also a ligand for the plasma membrane receptor Hcar2 and is known to have immunomodulatory functions via ligating Hcar2, inhibiting inflammasome activation, and via histone deacetylase inhibition.8–10

This raises the possibility that ethanol-induced reduction in β-oxidation, in addition to causing hepatocyte steatosis, may also contribute to liver inflammation by reduction in BHB induced immunomodulation.

PARAGRAPH

To test the effect of reduced BHB production in the setting of alcohol-induced liver injury we applied alcohol gavage with and without chemical inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1), a key step in beta-oxidation.

This is a relevant experimental approach because long term consumption of alcohol induces down regulation of CPT-1 and inhibition of beta oxidation.11

By using a direct CPT-1 inhibitor we can test the specific effect of inhibition of beta-oxidation and reduced BHB production, independently from the many other effects of chronic alcohol consumption.

PARAGRAPH

Collectively we have shown a novel and protective effect of BHB production in alcohol excess, and importantly linked alcohol-induced mitochondrial dysfunction with the development of liver inflammation via metabolite derangement.

This opens up the possibility that immune modulation via administration of intravenous BHB may be protective in AH, and such protective effects have been shown by administration of the HCA1 agonist lactate in acute pancreatitis.12

Results

SECTION

Liver BHB concentration in alcoholic hepatitis

PARAGRAPH

We initially wanted to confirm if the basic assumption that BHB concentration is lower in livers with AH was true.

The clinical characteristics of the control and AH groups are shown (Table S1).

Liver BHB concentration was assayed and there was a significant reduction in liver BHB concentration in the AH livers (Fig. 1A).

SECTION

Combination of the beta-oxidation inhibitor etomoxir and ethanol induced liver injury

PARAGRAPH

Having confirmed that BHB levels are lower in AH we next wanted to directly test if a reduction in BHB production can exacerbate alcohol-induced liver injury.

To specifically test the role of BHB in alcohol-induce liver injury, and to isolate this from all of the other changes associated with alcohol consumption, we chose to use etomoxir an inhibitor of β-oxidation.

In the absence of ethanol, etomoxir did not cause liver steatosis, injury or inflammation as shown by normal liver histology (Fig. 1B and C) and normal plasma ALT levels (Fig. 1E).

Consistent with previous reports,16 a binge of ethanol resulted in mild accumulation of small lipid droplets in the liver (Fig. 1B and C) and moderate elevation of plasma ALT (Fig. 1E).

An acute dose of ethanol in the presence of etomoxir resulted in a significantly greater lipid accumulation in hepatocytes (Fig. 1B and C), and significantly higher plasma ALT (Fig. 1E).

Etomoxir and ethanol separately upregulated the triglyceride levels in the liver slightly (Fig. 1D), while the combination of etomoxir and ethanol elevated hepatic triglyceride (TG) levels (Fig. 1D).

Neutrophil infiltration is a key marker of alcoholic steatohepatitis, and we quantified the number of neutrophils (CD11b+Ly6G+) in the liver 16 h after ethanol gavage by flow cytometry.

Etomoxir or ethanol treatments alone had no effect on the number of neutrophils (Fig. 1F).

However, the combination of etomoxir and ethanol resulted in a significantly increased number of neutrophils in the liver (Fig. 1F).

Immunochemistry confirmed the increase in neutrophil infiltration in the livers of mice treated with etomoxir and ethanol (Fig. 1G and H).

In addition, we also found the combination of etomoxir and ethanol significantly elevated the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines such as Il6 and Tnf but not Il1b in the liver (Fig. S1).

Etomoxir has been shown to decrease BHB levels in humans, and our goal in using etomoxir was to reduce liver BHB concentrations.17,18

We found a single etomoxir injection decreased BHB levels in murine livers (Fig. 1I).

Because ethanol is metabolized to BHB, liver BHB concentrations were higher after an ethanol binge, which is consistent with previous studies showing that BHB levels are higher in alcoholics in the early stages of alcohol consumption, and in alcohol fed mice.19,20

As predicted by the mechanism of action of etomoxir, BHB levels were lower in mice treated with etomoxir and ethanol as compared to ethanol alone (Fig. 1I).

Collectively, the combination of etomoxir and ethanol induced the key features of alcoholic steatohepatitis, as shown by higher plasma ALT, greater hepatic fatty acid accumulation and more neutrophil influx, accompanied by decreased BHB levels in the liver, which is consistent with the BHB alteration in the liver of patients with AH.

SECTION

BHB rescued the liver injury induced by etomoxir and ethanol

PARAGRAPH

The liver inflammation induced by alcohol after inhibition of β-oxidation by etomoxir could be because of metabolic changes other than a reduction in BHB.

To confirm the role of BHB in the increased liver inflammation caused by inhibition of β-oxidation the experiment was repeated but with supplementation of BHB.

Mice received intraperitoneal BHB 6 h after ethanol gavage, and liver injury was assessed 10 h after BHB injection.

BHB supplementation did not affect the liver injury caused by ethanol gavage alone (Fig. 2A), presumably because BHB levels are already elevated (Fig. 1I).

However, addition of BHB significantly decreased the plasma ALT levels of mice treated with etomoxir and ethanol (Fig. 2A).

Histological examination and TG measurement of liver tissues revealed BHB attenuated steatosis and TG levels in the liver caused by etomoxir and ethanol (Fig. 2B–D).

BHB supplementation also decreased neutrophil infiltration (Fig. 2E–G).

Collectively these data demonstrate that inhibition of β-oxidation results in lower hepatic BHB levels (Fig. 1I), and BHB supplementation protects from the increase in ethanol-induced steatohepatitis caused by inhibition of β-oxidation (Fig. 2).

This strongly supports the hypothesis that inhibition of β-oxidation worsens liver inflammation and injury by reducing hepatic BHB levels.

SECTION

The therapeutic effect of BHB is dependent on Hcar2

PARAGRAPH

BHB has immunomodulatory actions that are dependent, and independent of the plasma membrane receptor Hcar2.8–10

If Hcar2 is required for BHB mediated immunomodulation in the liver, then unlike wild-type mice, supplementation of BHB in Hcar2 deficient mice will not protect from etomoxir and alcohol mediated liver injury.

This was tested and BHB did not decrease hepatocyte steatosis (Fig. 3A and B), hepatic TG levels (Fig. 3C), or plasma ALT levels (Fig. 3D) in Hcar2−/− mice.

Intrahepatic neutrophil numbers were also analyzed, and no significant difference was observed in the number of neutrophils in the livers in Hcar2 deficient mice treated with and without BHB (Fig. 3E).

These results demonstrate that the protective effect of BHB on alcohol-induced liver injury is dependent on Hcar2.

SECTION

BHB increased IL-10 and M2 macrophages in the liver

PARAGRAPH

Having established that BHB can protect the liver from alcohol-induced inflammation we wanted to investigate the cellular mechanism by which this occurs.

We compared the hepatic mRNA levels of several cytokines known to be important in alcohol mediated liver injury1 in the ethanol alone group and the combination group of ethanol and etomoxir with and without BHB (Fig. 4).

We found that the combination of ethanol and etomoxir resulted in significant elevations of liver mRNA levels of Il6 and Il10 (Fig. 4).

IL-6 has been recently shown to play an inflammatory role in alcoholic steatohepatitis through the IL-6–p47phox–oxidative stress pathway in neutrophils.21

BHB did not change hepatic mRNA levels of these cytokines with ethanol gavage alone.

We also examined the effect of BHB on liver mRNA levels of the above cytokines with the combination of etomoxir and ethanol gavage.

There was no difference in mRNA levels of Il1b, Il4, Il6, Il17a, and Tnf in BHB and control treated livers, however, mRNA levels of Il10 were significantly higher in the livers of BHB treated mice (Fig. 4).

This was of interest because IL-10 has been shown to be anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective in alcoholic liver disease, and polymorphisms in its promoter region, resulting in low expression of IL-10, have been shown to be associated with advanced alcoholic liver disease.22

PARAGRAPH

The aforementioned in vivo experiments are important in establishing integrated consequences of the various manipulations of high levels of alcohol, inhibition of β-oxidation and supplementation with BHB, but they are not cell specific.

To obtain mechanistic insights it is necessary to move to in vitro single cell population experiments.

As we had already identified a requirement for Hcar2 for the hepatoprotective effects of BHB a first step was to obtain the cellular localization of Hcar2 in the liver.

This was done by imaging the liver in a reporter mouse expressing mRFP under the control of the Hcar2 promoter, after staining for F4/80 (macrophages and Kupffer cells), and separately staining for CD32 (endothelium).14

Merging of the F4/80 and CD32 images with Hcar2 clearly shows perfect overlap with F4/80+ cells, and no overlap with CD32+ cells (Fig. 5A).

PARAGRAPH

The localization of Hcar2 on liver tissue macrophages, and the increase in IL-10 expression in total liver suggested that BHB was modifying the liver macrophage phenotype.

Tissue macrophages are well known for their plasticity, and at extreme ends of polarization are classified as pro-inflammatory M1 or anti-inflammatory M2.

This is recognized to be over simplistic as there are over 3,500 differentially regulated genes in tissue macrophages and there is no single M1 or a single M2 phenotype.23

Within these recognized limitations, the M1 and M2 phenotypes still provide a convenient shorthand for classification of tissue macrophages and we used flowcytometric analysis of markers associated with a pro-inflammatory M1 like phenotype (CD80, CCR7, TLR2/4, TLR9 and iNOS), which did not show any difference after BHB treatment (Fig. 5B).

In contrast, markers associated with an anti-inflammatory M2 like phenotype such as ER-MP23, CD206, ST2 and IL-10 were all upregulated by BHB (Fig. 5C).

Collectively, these data show that Hcar2 is expressed on liver macrophages.

During ethanol-induced liver injury, BHB elevated IL-10 expression in whole liver, and enhanced the M2 phenotype in the liver macrophage population.

SECTION

BHB promotes M2 Macrophage polarization through activation of cAMP pathway and reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential

PARAGRAPH

To confirm the effect of BHB on the M2 macrophage phenotype and to gain mechanistic understanding of the pathways involved, we induced M2 polarization in conventional BMDMs and compared gene expression with and without BHB.

Under M2 polarization condition (IL-4 and IL-13), expression of Il10 and Arg1 was significantly upregulated by BHB in BMDMs at 48 h (Fig. 6A), which is consistent with the alteration of macrophage phenotype in vivo.

We also examined an earlier time point and found the mRNA of Il10, Arg1 and Ym1 (Chi3l3) had already been upregulated at 24 h (Fig. 6B).

Expression of other M2 markers such as Cd163, Fizz1 (Retnla) and Nr3c2 was comparable with and without BHB at 24 h (Fig. 6B).

Because IL-10 itself could enhance M2 polarization, to investigate whether BHB promoted the M2 polarization directly or via an IL-10 mediated pathway, we examined the effect of BHB on M2 polarization of IL-10 deficient BMDMs.

As shown (Fig. 6C), BHB upregulated M2 marker such as Arg1 and Ym1 in the absence of IL-10, demonstrating an IL-10 independent effect of BHB on macrophage polarization.

PARAGRAPH

Since a requirement for the receptor Hcar2 had already been established we considered the downstream signaling pathways.

In macrophages, Hcar2 activation is known to increase cAMP levels via a conventional adenylate cyclase/PKA pathway.24

This was of interest because increase in cAMP has been shown to regulate macrophage function by promoting M2-like functionality.25

To confirm the role of BHB driven cAMP, a cAMP stimulated CREB-reporter system was used.

HEK cells were transfected with CRE/promoter-luciferase plasmid and treated with IL-4 and IL-13 alone or in the presence of BHB, or stable cAMP analogue (db-cAMP).

Treatment with IL-4 and IL-13 alone induced significant upregulation of CREB activity (Fig. 6D).

Addition of BHB further increased the activity of luciferase under treatment of IL-4 and IL-13, confirming a BHB/cAMP pathway (Fig. 6D).

Rp-cAMPS, a specific membrane-permeable inhibitor of cAMP pathway that competitively binds to and prevents the cAMP-induced activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA),26 decreased the upregulation of Il10, Arg1 and Ym1 induced by BHB (Fig. 6E).

PARAGRAPH

BHB mediated cAMP can result in many intracellular changes.

We were interested in reports that the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of cytochrome c oxidase with PKA switched on the allosteric ATP inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase and kept the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) low.27,28

Mitochondrial membrane potential is generated by a proton gradient existing across the inner mitochondrial membrane.29

Previous studies showed maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential is associated with the development of the M1 phenotype, and loss with an M2 phenotype.30

Consistently, we found BHB decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in IL-4 and IL-13 treated BMDMs at 24 h (Fig. 6F).

To test if the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential was required for the ability of BHB to induce an M2 phenotype, the mitochondrial membrane potential was artificially maintained by oligomycin A, which maintains the mitochondrial membrane potential by inhibiting the activity of ATP synthase.

As previously stated, BHB resulted in an increase in Il10 and other M2-associated genes, but this did not occur in the presence of oligomycin A (Fig. 6G).

SECTION

BHB protected from the alcohol-induced liver injury induced by chronic ethanol feeding

PARAGRAPH

To investigate if BHB is protective in chronic ethanol feeding model, mice were fed with an ethanol liquid diet for 10 days.

On the 11th day of ethanol-diet feeding, to replicate the decreased BHB levels present in the alcoholic patients (Fig. 1A), we injected mice with etomoxir, followed 30 min later by an ethanol gavage (5 g/kg).

BHB were i.p. injected 6 h after ethanol gavage.

We found BHB reduced hepatic steatosis (Fig. 7A and B), total liver TG (Fig. 7C), and plasma ALT (Fig. 7D).

In summary, we showed BHB could protect from chronic alcohol-induced liver injury.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The association of chronic excess alcohol intake with liver disease is known very widely.

It is less well appreciated that long term excess alcohol intake is associated with a range of clinical presentations.

Among these AH is of great importance because of the high associated mortality, and the lack of understanding of its etiology.1

Clinically, AH develops unpredictably over weeks, after many years of high levels of alcohol consumption.

AH progresses with jaundice, abdominal pain, fever and frequently progressing to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome with multi organ failure.

The 28-day mortality is high and ranges between 15–25%, and despite multiple clinical trials an effective therapy has not been identified.1

A key feature in this lack of progress in therapeutics is a lack of understanding of why individuals with chronic high alcohol consumption unpredictably develop a life-threatening sterile inflammatory response in the liver.

PARAGRAPH

Our study has directly tested the concept that loss of the anti-inflammatory metabolite BHB is a contributing factor to liver inflammation in AH.

The livers of patients with severe AH have significantly lower BHB levels than controls (Fig. 1A), making it possible that low BHB has a mechanistic role.

Direct evidence for a role for BHB was subsequently demonstrated in a series of in vivo experiments, using a chemical inhibitor of β-oxidation, which reduced liver BHB and increased inflammation in alcohol-induced injury (Fig. 1B–H).

Supplemented BHB reduced the increased inflammatory response caused by inhibiting β-oxidation, and this effect of BHB supplementation was lost in Hcar2 knockout mice (Figs. 2 and 3).

This provides strong evidence for a novel anti-inflammatory role for BHB via Hcar2, and suggests a pro-inflammatory switch linked to the loss of BHB produced by mitochondria.

Excess alcohol intake along with poor food intake is well known to result in a state of alcoholic ketoacidosis with elevated BHB levels.31

As an interesting clinical correlate, alcoholic ketoacidosis and AH do not appear to occur at the same time.

PARAGRAPH

The requirement for Hcar2 for the anti-inflammatory effects of BHB was unexpected as BHB has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects by direct inhibition of inflammasome activation, independent of its known activation of Hcar2.

In the Hcar2 independent pathways BHB inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome by preventing K(+) efflux and reducing ASC oligomerization and speck formation.10

This has been shown to have important in vivo anti-inflammatory effects including inhibiting neutrophil activation in gout.32

The Hcar2 reporter mice placed Hcar2 on liver macrophage populations, and on these cells BHB did not broadly inhibit macrophage activation but stimulated a switch of the well-recognized M1/M2 spectrum towards M2.

This is a more nuanced effect because although moving away from M1 would have resulted in loss of pro-inflammatory functions, the switch to M2 results in gain of functions such as tissue repair and remodeling.

In addition to promoting expression of M2 genes such as Arg1 and Ym1, Il10 expression was also elevated by BHB.

IL-10 itself can promote M2 polarization, and by using IL-10 deficient mice we demonstrated an IL-10 independent effect of BHB in stimulating the M2 phenotype.

PARAGRAPH

Activation of Hcar2 is known to activate a cAMP pathway and we were interested in the ability of cAMP to downregulate the mitochondrial membrane potential.33

This is relevant because of the requirement for a high mitochondrial membrane potential for the maintenance of an M1 phenotype and a low mitochondrial membrane potential for an M2 phenotype.30

BHB, along with switching towards an M2 phenotype, resulted in a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 6F).

Artificially maintaining a high mitochondrial membrane potential with the ATPase inhibitor oligomycin blocked the switch to the M2 phenotype (Fig. 6G).

PARAGRAPH

Collectively, this study identifies a novel anti-inflammatory role of BHB in alcohol-induced liver injury.

This is significant as it provides a link between the metabolic changes known to occur from chronic alcohol consumption, and the subsequent development of liver inflammation.

It also raises the possibility that derangements in other metabolites such as succinate, citrate and lactate, with known effects on sterile inflammation, may contribute to liver inflammation.30,34,35

Despite showing an important anti-inflammatory effect of BHB in AH, this study does not identify if a decrease in BHB concentrations is the switch responsible for a change in the liver from a low level of chronic inflammation to the increased inflammatory state in AH.

If this is the case, one possibility is that there is a gradual decrease in mitochondrial function and loss of BHB production which eventually reaches a tipping point.

Another possibility is that the BHB- Hcar2 pathway is downstream of one of the known pathways, such as ethanol-induced endotoxemia.36

This is attractive because lipopolysaccharide concentrations in the range known to be present in alcoholic liver disease result in inhibition of β-oxidation and reduction in BHB production in muscle cells.37,38

If the same is true for hepatocytes then lipopolysaccharide, in addition to being directly pro-inflammatory for macrophages, may also stimulate hepatic inflammation by reducing production of BHB hepatocytes.

PARAGRAPH

There is extensive experience on therapeutic elevation of serum BHB levels, ranging from refractory epilepsy to genetic disorders of metabolism.39

Starvation and high-fat/low-protein diets are not an option in patients with AH as they may not have the capacity to make BHB.

Supplemental BHB however may be viable option.

Oral administration of the sodium salt of BHB in doses of 80–900 mg/Kg/day was sufficient to achieve blood levels of BHB of 0.19–0.36 mM and produced a therapeutic effect in children with acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.40

Intravenous administration of BHB in healthy subjects and septic patients increased serum levels to 2 mM and did not have any adverse effects.41

More recently lactate, the ligand for GPR81 (closely related to Hcar2), was found to reduce C-reactive protein levels and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome in a clinical trial of acute pancreatitis.12

There are significant similarities between AH and pancreatitis in the sterile inflammatory pathways that are activated, and these data point towards a new metabolite-based anti-inflammatory approach in AH.7,42
