TITLE

CXCL13-mediated recruitment of intrahepatic CXCR5+CD8+ T cells favors viral control in chronic HBV infection

PARAGRAPH

Exhaustion of CD8+ T cells is an important factor in the development of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

CD8+ T cells expressing the receptor CXCR5 are partially exhausted, but have potent antiviral activity, as they produce high levels of HBV-specific cytokines in chronic HBV infection.

Increased expression of CXCL13 within the liver facilitates the recruitment of CXCR5+CD8+T cells and establishes effective immune control of HBV infection.
