ABSTRACT

TITLE

CXCL13-mediated recruitment of intrahepatic CXCR5+CD8+ T cells favors viral control in chronic HBV infection

PARAGRAPH

Although CD8+T cell exhaustion hampers viral control during chronic HBV infection, the pool of CD8+T cells is phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous.

Therefore, a specific subpopulation of CD8+T cells should be further investigated.

This study aims to dissect a subset of CD8+T cells expressing C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5) in chronic HBV infection.

PARAGRAPH

The frequency of CXCR5+CD8+T cells and the levels of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13), a chemokine of CXCR5, were measured in patients with chronic HBV infection.

C57BL/6, interleukin (IL)-21 receptor- or B cell-deficient mice were hydrodynamically injected with pAAV-HBV1.2 plasmids.

Phenotype and functions of peripheral and intrahepatic CXCR5+ and CXCR5−CD8+T cells were assessed.

PARAGRAPH

CXCR5+CD8+T cells were partially exhausted but possessed a stronger antiviral ability than the CXCR5− subset in patients with chronic HBV infection; moreover, CXCR5+CD8+T cells were associated with a favorable treatment response in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).

High levels of CXCL13 from patients with CHB facilitated the recruitment of intrahepatic CXCR5+CD8+T cells, and this subpopulation produced high levels of HBV-specific interferon (IFN)-γ and IL-21.

Notably, PD1 (programmed death 1) blockade and exogenous IL-21 enhanced the production of IFN-γ.

More strikingly, mice injected with CXCR5+CD8+T cells showed remarkably decreased expression of HBsAg.

Additionally, an impaired production of HBV-specific IFN-γ from intrahepatic CXCR5+CD8+T cells was observed in IL-21 receptor- or B cell-deficient mice.

PARAGRAPH

CXCL13 promotes the recruitment of CXCR5+CD8+T cells to the liver, and this subpopulation improves viral control in chronic HBV infection.

The identification of this unique subpopulation may contribute to a better understanding of CD8+T cell functions and provide a potential immunotherapeutic target in chronic HBV infection.
