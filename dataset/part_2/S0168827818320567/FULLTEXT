TITLE

Genetic inactivation of Nrf2 prevents clonal expansion of initiated cells in a nutritional model of rat hepatocarcinogenesis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second largest cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.1

Unfortunately, our knowledge of the genetic/epigenetic alterations implicated in HCC initiation and progression is still fragmented.

The driving genetic alterations to which tumor cells are addicted and that can be targeted have not been identified.

In this scenario, HCC is probably one of the tumor types where a more complete understanding of the underlying genetic alterations could have a major impact on the development of new treatment strategies.

NRF2, also known as NFE2L2, is of particular interest as the role of the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway in cancer development has provided conflicting results.2–4

NRF2 is a master transcriptional activator of genes encoding enzymes that protect cells from oxidative stress and xenobiotics, as well as various drug efflux pump-members of the multidrug resistance protein family.5

NRF2 is negatively regulated and targeted to proteasomal degradation by KEAP1.6–9

It was reported in a number of studies that point mutations in the KEAP1 or NRF2 genes are often present in primary tumors.10–16

As to human HCC, two recent studies using whole-exome sequencing have revealed mutations of either NRF2 (6.4%) or KEAP1 (8%),17,18 suggesting that the dysregulation of this pathway may play a relevant role in a subset of human HCC.

Notably, increased levels of NRF2 mRNA have been found associated with poor prognosis in HCC.19

PARAGRAPH

Increasing lines of evidence suggest that human HCC might arise as a consequence of chronic non-alcoholic fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis because of increased oxidative stress.20–22

Indeed, increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation products and decreased levels of antioxidant molecules have been observed in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.23

Conversely, in dietary mice models, Nrf2-deficiency favors non-alcoholic steatohepatitis development.24–27

PARAGRAPH

This study aimed to investigate whether Nrf2 activation occurs in the diethylnitrosamine (DENA)/choline-devoid methionine-deficient (CMD) nutritional model of rat liver carcinogenesis that, like in humans, is associated with steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis.28

To this end, we examined whether the DENA/CMD model allows us to identify Nrf2 activation in early preneoplastic lesions.

Moreover, in order to directly clarify the role of Nrf2 in rat hepatocarcinogenesis, we investigated the development of preneoplastic lesions in an Nrf2KO rat model.29

Materials and methods

SECTION

Animals and treatments

PARAGRAPH

Five week-old male F344 rats were injected intraperitoneally with saline or DENA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at a dose of 150 mg/kg body weight.

After a one week recovery period, rats were fed a diet containing choline-supplemented (CS) or a CMD diet (Altromin, Vandoies, Germany) for 10 or 17 weeks (supplementary information and Fig. S1).

Nrf2KO29 and wild-type (WT) rats at the age of 5–6 weeks (100–130 g body weight) were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of DENA (150 mg/kg) and fed CMD for 10 weeks.

In some experiments, Nrf2KO and WT rats were injected intraperitoneally with a single DENA dose (150 mg/kg) and sacrificed after 6 h, 24 h and 48 h. Lipid extraction and measurement of triglycerides was performed according to Schroeder-Gloeckler et al.30 (supplementary information).

Animal procedures were performed according to the procedures approved from the Ethic Commission of the University of Cagliari and the Italian Ministry of Health or Tohoku University and Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan.

SECTION

Histology and immunohistochemistry

PARAGRAPH

Immediately after sacrifice, liver sections were fixed in 10% formalin or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen (supplementary information).

The area of GSTP or gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)-positive preneoplastic lesions was measured with ImageJ according to Schneider et al.31 For each rat, two different sections, from two distinct lobes were measured.

Only nodules over 4,000 μm2 were scored as GSTP-positive nodules.

SECTION

Determination of O6-ethyl-2-deoxyguanosine (O6-EtG) and hepatocyte proliferation

PARAGRAPH

The extent of O6-EtG in the liver of Nrf2KO and WT rats was determined by anti-O6-ethyl-2-deoxyguanosine antibody (ER6, Squarix Biotechnology, Marl, Germany).

For determination of hepatocyte proliferation, BrdU (1 g/L) dissolved in drinking water was given to the rats for 2, 3 or 5 days before sacrifice, depending on the experiments.

Labeling index (LI) was expressed as the number of BrdU-positive hepatocyte nuclei/100 nuclei or per mm2 of area measured by the ImageJ software.

Results were expressed as the mean ± standard error (SE) of 3 to 6 rats.

At least 2,000 hepatocyte nuclei/liver were scored.

SECTION

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR)

PARAGRAPH

RNA was isolated from laser-micro-dissected preneoplastic lesions or surrounding tissues using MirVana (Ambion, Austin, TX), as previously reported.32

In the experiment with Nrf2 KO rats, RNA was isolated with Sepazol RNA I Super G (Nacalai, Kyoto, Japan).

Primers are listed in Table S1.

The relative levels were determined using the ΔΔCT.

SECTION

DNA sequencing

PARAGRAPH

The same cDNA used for qPCR analysis was used also for gene sequencing.

To identify Nrf2 mutations we amplified exon 2 of rat Nrf2 gene (annealing 66–60 °C), using a Touch-down PCR protocol (see supplementary information).

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or mean ± SE.

Analysis of significance was done by t Student’s test and by One-Way ANOVA using the GraphPad software (La Jolla, California).

p values were considered significant at p <0.05.

Results

SECTION

CMD diet promotes the growth of DENA-induced preneoplastic hepatocytes

PARAGRAPH

Rats pre-treated with DENA and then fed CS for 10 weeks showed normal liver tissue architecture without any sign of steatosis or other morphological alterations (Fig. 1A, left).

Conversely, rats fed a CMD diet presented diffuse macrovesicular steatosis and some very thin septa, presumably of fibrotic nature (Fig. 1A, middle).

Extensive fatty liver associated with the presence of hepatocyte foci, usually separated by thin septa and some inflammatory cell aggregates, was observed in rats exposed to DENA and fed CMD diet (Fig. 1A, right).

Immunohistochemical staining against GSTP, a well-known marker of hepatic preneoplastic lesions,33 revealed the presence of several GSTP-positive foci that exhibited a wide variability in size, with some displaying partial or full resistance to steatosis in rats with DENA and CMD diet (Fig. 1A, lower panels).

Only occasionally single hepatocytes were GSTP-positive in the DENA and CS group or saline and CMD group.

PARAGRAPH

Increased liver/body weight ratio (Fig. 1B) and a multinodular structure generated by well-defined fibrotic septa (Fig. 1C) were more evident in rats fed CMD diet for 17 weeks regardless of the DENA pre-treatment.

A high number of preneoplastic GSTP-positive nodules displaying enlarged size (Fig. 1C–E) and a significantly higher proliferative activity compared to the GSTP-negative surrounding tissue (Fig. 1F) were observed.

No GSTP-positive foci were seen in the DENA and CS group or saline and CMD group.

These results indicate that CMD diet promotes the growth of DENA-induced preneoplastic hepatocytes.

SECTION

Nrf2 is activated in GSTP-positive preneoplastic nodules

PARAGRAPH

The CMD diet model leads to steatohepatitis, a condition characterized by enhanced oxidative stress and liver injury.

One of the major antioxidant defense mechanisms is the Keap1-Nrf2 system.

Once Nrf2 is activated, it leads to increased transcription of several cytoprotective enzymes and to enhanced cell survival.5–7

Activation of Nrf2 is believed to represent a critical event that favors tumor cells in their progression.3

Since GSTP-positive preneoplastic nodules in the CMD model exhibit increased proliferation compared to the GSTP-negative surrounding liver cells, we investigated the presence of Nrf2 activation.

To this aim, RNA was extracted from 16 laser-microdissected GSTP-positive preneoplastic nodules.

Three randomly selected areas of normal livers and four from CMD-fed rats were used as controls.

qPCR analysis showed that GSTP-positive preneoplastic nodules exhibited increased mRNA levels of Nqo1, the principal Nrf2 target gene, compared to control liver or CMD alone (Fig. 2A).

Similarly, a higher expression of G6pd, the rate-limiting enzyme of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and an Nrf2 target gene,34 was found in GSTP-positive lesions, further supporting the activation of Nrf2 in the tumorigenic process (Fig. 2A).

These results support our hypothesis that Nrf2 is activated in GSTP-positive preneoplastic nodules.

PARAGRAPH

Accordingly, immunohistochemistry displayed G6PD staining in several GSTP-positive nodules, being virtually absent in all control groups (Fig. 2B).

In keeping with other reports,35 G6PD immunostaining was positive only in a subset of GSTP-positive nodules (128 G6PD+ nodules out of 557 GSTP+ nodules) (Fig. 2C).

Co-expression of GSTP and G6PD was associated with a higher proliferative capacity of preneoplastic nodules compared to that of nodules positive for GSTP alone (623 BrdU-positive nuclei/mm2 vs. 281/mm2) (Fig. 2D,E).

SECTION

Frequent Nrf2 mutations in GSTP-positive preneoplastic nodules

PARAGRAPH

Nrf2 mutations activate Nrf2 as they lead to the loss of Keap1 binding.12

Therefore, we evaluated whether Nrf2 mutations occur in preneoplastic nodules developed 17 weeks after DENA administration.

Four selected areas from the liver of DENA+CS rats, four from the livers of CMD-fed rats, and seven GSTP-negative areas from surrounding liver were also analyzed.

While no mutations were found in the GSTP-negative surrounding tissue or in tissues from rats exposed to DENA+CS or CMD alone, Nrf2 mutations were present in 23/35 (65.7%) of preneoplastic lesions examined (Fig. 3A).

Importantly, all of them were missense mutations, predicted to be protein damaging with a score of 100% (Polyphen-2), and localized within, or very close to, the two Keap1 binding motifs: ETGE (high-affinity binding site) and DLG (low-affinity binding) (Fig. 3B).

Thus, these mutations can be considered activating and thus able to constitutively activate the pathway.

These results indicate that Nrf2 mutations frequently exist in GSTP-positive preneoplastic nodules.

SECTION

Nrf2 genetic inactivation inhibits the growth of preneoplastic hepatocytes

PARAGRAPH

To directly investigate whether Nrf2 is crucial for the clonal expansion of preneoplastic hepatocytes, we next used a recently developed model of Nrf2KO rats29 and examined whether Nrf2 loss affects early steps of hepatocarcinogenesis or not.

For this purpose, Nrf2KO rats and WT rats were given a single dose of DENA and fed CMD for 10 weeks (Fig. S1).

We found that Nrf2 inactivation resulted in the absent/low expression of its target genes Gstp1 and G6pd (Fig. 4A).

While WT rats displayed several GSTP or G6PD-positive lesions, no hepatic areas positive for these markers were observed in Nrf2KO rats (Fig. 4B).

The Nrf2KO rats displayed a decreased liver/body weight ratio compared to WT, but no significant difference was observed in hepatic triglyceride content or in the plasma levels of hepatocyte-specific alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (Fig. S2A–D).

PARAGRAPH

Since GSTP and G6PD are Nrf2 target gene products, they cannot be used as markers for identifying preneoplastic lesions in Nrf2KO rats.

Therefore, to investigate whether Nrf2 genetic inactivation could interfere with tumorigenesis, we identified early preneoplastic lesions by using GGT.

Indeed, GGT has been reported to be regulated in an Nrf2-independent manner.36

GGT is considered the second best marker after GSTP for rat preneoplasia37 and has been reported to efficiently identify preneoplastic foci/nodules generated by exposure of rats to the CMD diet.38

As shown, an approximately fivefold increase of Ggt1 mRNA level was observed in both WT and Nrf2KO rats treated with DENA+CMD diet (Fig. 4A).

Interestingly, a diffuse GGT staining was observed in the liver of Nrf2KO rats, as a consequence of a massive ductular cell proliferation (Fig. 4C, right), further supporting the notion that GGT is expressed in an Nrf2-independent manner; however, virtually no GGT-positive preneoplastic lesions were observed in Nrf2KO rats.

Conversely, WT rats not only displayed GSTP+ and G6PD+ preneoplastic lesions (Fig. 4B), but also numerous GGT+ preneoplastic foci (Fig. 4C, left and D).

Similar to what was observed for GSTP and G6PD-positive foci, GGT-positive lesions also displayed a much higher proliferative activity than that of the GGT-negative surrounding liver (Fig. 4E).

These results showed that Nrf2 is critical for the growth of preneoplastic hepatocytes.

SECTION

Lack of formation of preneoplastic foci in Nrf2KO rats is not due to impaired DENA-induced initiation

PARAGRAPH

To uncover the molecular basis of the lack of preneoplastic lesions seen in Nrf2KO rats, we next investigated whether the genetic inactivation of Nrf2 gene could have impaired the biotransformation of DENA, and therefore, liver necrosis and regeneration.

Since DENA is converted by Cyp2e1 to reactive metabolites that bind to DNA,39 we investigated the expression levels of Cyp2e1 in untreated WT and Nrf2KO rats.

No difference in Cyp2e1 mRNA levels was observed between the two groups (Fig. 5A).

Cyp2e1 mRNA was significantly decreased after DENA administration, as previously shown,40 with only minimal differences between WT and Nrf2KO rats.

Accordingly, a similar number of hepatocyte nuclei positive for the promutagenic O6-EtG were observed in both WT and Nrf2KO rats at 6 and 24 h after DENA administration, with a trend towards a decrease at 48 h likely due to the engagement of DNA repair (Fig. 5B,C).

As a consequence of DENA-induced damage, hepatocellular necrosis was increased 24 h after DENA administration.

The extent was similar in WT and Nrf2KO rats until 48 h (Fig. 5D).

PARAGRAPH

An alternative possibility is that reduced liver regeneration after DENA-induced necrosis could be responsible for the lack of preneoplastic foci formation observed in Nrf2KO rats.

To address this question, 6 h after DENA treatment animals were given BrdU in drinking water for 42 h and were sacrificed at 48 h. BrdU incorporation displayed no difference between WT and Nrf2 KO rats (Fig. 5E,F).

In agreement with these observations, the expression level of the proliferating marker Ki67 was upregulated to a similar extent in both groups (Fig. 5G).

Based on these results, we conclude that the lack of preneoplastic lesions in Nrf2 KO rats is not the consequence of inhibition of DENA-induced initiation.

SECTION

CMD-induced increase of liver injury and hepatocyte proliferation in Nrf2KO rats does not support preneoplastic foci formation

PARAGRAPH

Tissue environment is known to deeply influence tumorigenesis.41,42

Therefore, we investigated whether the lack of preneoplastic lesions in KO rats could be due to a lesser degree of liver injury and chronic regeneration caused by the CMD regimen compared to WT rats.

However, livers of Nrf2KO rats treated with DENA and fed CMD diet for 10 weeks macroscopically showed a more pronounced cirrhotic appearance (Fig. 6A).

Mallory’s trichrome staining indicated a more severe fibrosis in the liver of Nrf2KO rats compared to WT rats (Fig. 6B).

Inflammatory response assessed by histological examination, Tnf mRNA levels and the number of CD4+ cells were also higher in Nrf2KO rats than in WT rats (Fig. S3A–C).

Furthermore, biochemical determination of plasma ALT levels demonstrated a stronger liver injury in Nrf2KO rats than in WT rats (Fig. 6C).

Chronic liver damage caused by DENA and CMD diet to Nrf2KO rat livers was associated with a stronger compensatory hepatocyte regeneration, evaluated with BrdU incorporation (Fig. 6D,E).

These results show that no preneoplastic lesions can be generated in the absence of Nrf2, in spite of the fact that KO rats are more susceptible to CMD-induced liver injury and display an even stronger compensatory hepatocyte proliferation.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The KEAP1-NRF2 axis is an integrated redox sensitive signaling system that regulates up to 10% of human genes.43

While NRF2 protects normal cells from oxidative stress and DNA-damaging electrophiles, it confers cytoprotection against high endogenous levels of ROS, thus increasing survival and resistance to chemotherapy of cancer cells.15

Recently, the findings that NRF2 overexpression and/or the somatic mutations take place in many human cancers including HCC17,18 and that cancers with high NRF2 levels are associated with poor prognosis12,21 have revealed an oncogenic role of NRF2.

However, whether NRF2 plays a pro- or anti-tumorigenic role in premalignant lesions is still unclear.3

Nrf2 activation due to the somatic mutations occurs very early in rat hepatocarcinogenesis,32,44 suggesting its critical role in the initial stages of HCC development.

A novel finding of our study is that genetic inactivation of Nrf2 is sufficient to impair the formation of preneoplastic foci.

The finding that these foci can be identified at an extremely early stage, when they are made up by 10–15 hepatocytes, implies that Nrf2 exerts a crucial role from the very beginning of the tumorigenic process.

PARAGRAPH

Recently, Ngo et al.45 showed a lack of HCC formation in DENA-treated Nrf2KO mice and suggested that this was the consequence of an impaired initiation due to an insufficient compensatory proliferation of Nrf2KO hepatocytes following DENA administration.

On the contrary, the present work provides evidence that lack of preneoplastic lesions is not due to inhibition of the “initiation” step of hepatocarcinogenesis.

Indeed, the finding of comparable levels of hepatic Cyp2e1 and of plasma ALT clearly shows no difference in DENA biotransformation and in the extent of hepatocellular necrosis.

As it is known that at least one cell cycle is required for the fixation of DNA damage-induced lesions, we have also considered the possibility that the lack of preneoplastic hepatocytes could be due to impaired liver regeneration following DENA-induced necrosis.

However, we found similar levels of proliferation between WT and Nrf2KO rats.

Thus, Nrf2 appears to be a necessary prerequisite for promoting the clonal expansion of hepatocytes previously initiated by DENA, rather than for the initiation step.

PARAGRAPH

Our study also shows that livers of Nrf2KO rats displayed more extensive fibrosis, increased inflammatory reaction and necrosis compared to WT rats.

On a theoretical basis, this environment should represent a promoting condition for HCC progression.

The finding that no preneoplastic lesions develop in Nrf2KO livers, in spite of a significantly higher rate of necro-inflammatory response and chronic hepatocyte proliferation, further supports a key role of Nrf2 in hepatocarcinogenesis.

PARAGRAPH

Nrf2, other than maintaining redox homeostasis in quiescent cells, redirects glucose metabolism into anabolic pathways.34

Indeed, while increased Nrf2 expression shifts glucose distribution toward the purine nucleotide synthesis (through activation of PPP), Nrf2 knockdown inhibits this process.34,35

It is conceivable that Nrf2-induced activation of PPP may account for the aggressive proliferation of Nrf2-overexpressing cells, by providing purines required for nucleic acid synthesis, and increased survival due to its ability to generate antioxidant species such as glutathione.

PARAGRAPH

Nrf2 silencing in rat hepatocarcinoma cells inhibits their tumorigenic ability, both in vitro and in vivo,15 further demonstrating that activation of this transcription factor is necessary to sustain the malignant phenotype.

However, exogenous expression of Nrf2, or even of activated forms of Nrf2, did not promote the progression toward a transformed phenotype.46

These results, together with the findings of our present work, suggest that although constitutive activation of Nrf2 per se is not sufficient to promote the transformation of liver cells, nevertheless, it is a sine qua non prerequisite for HCC development.

PARAGRAPH

Our study shows that Nrf2 mutations are frequent in early preneoplastic lesions in a nutritional model of hepatocarcinogenesis.

Most of the identified mutations can be considered bona fide activating mutations.

Our previous work has shown that Nrf2 mutations occur at a higher frequency (65.8%) in preneoplastic nodules generated by the rat resistant-hepatocyte (R-H) model.44

In the present study, V32E, the most frequent mutation observed in the R-H model (8/25 nodules), was also found to be the most common mutation (6/37).

On the opposite, D77G, relatively frequent in the R-H model (4/25), was not found in the present study, and T80A found in only 2/25 nodules in the R-H model was very frequent (6/35).

It is conceivable that different environments (cytostatic effect of 2-AAF in the R-H model vs. necro-inflammation caused by CMD) might select, among the hepatocytes carrying different DENA-induced DNA lesions, those conferring the best clonogenic ability in a specific environment, already recognized in other experimental models.47

PARAGRAPH

The Nrf2 mutations may not be the only mechanism responsible for the activation of the Keap1-Nrf2 system in the preneoplastic lesions.

Nrf2 activation can be the consequence of accumulation of p62/sequestosome 1 protein.48,49

In the present study, however, a role of this protein can be disregarded, as immunohistochemical staining revealed that virtually no GSTP-positive preneoplastic lesions displayed p62 accumulation (Fig. S4).

An alternative possibility is that dysregulation of microRNAs targeting Keap1 may be responsible for Nrf2 activation.32

Irrespectively of the mechanism(s) responsible for Nrf2 activation, our study provides evidence that stimulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway takes place in preneoplastic lesions, and that genetic inactivation of Nrf2 is sufficient to impair hepatocarcinogenesis.

Moreover, the results also imply that Nrf2 exerts a crucial role from the very beginning of the tumorigenic process and not only during tumor progression.

PARAGRAPH

Based on the high frequency of tumors displaying aberrant Nrf2 activation, including lung, hepatocellular, gall bladder, and ovarian carcinomas, Nrf2 should thus be regarded as an important pharmacological target.

Although currently no specific and effective Nrf2 inhibitors are available for therapeutic purposes, targeting Nrf2 remains a promising strategy for the treatment of liver cancer associated with altered functions of this gene.
