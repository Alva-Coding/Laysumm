TITLE

Outcomes of sequential treatment with sorafenib followed by regorafenib for HCC: Additional analyses from the phase III RESORCE trial

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

For patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who cannot benefit from resection, transplantation, or ablation, the oral multikinase inhibitor sorafenib at the approved dose of 800 mg/day is the standard first-line systemic treatment.1–3

Recently, lenvatinib was shown to be non-inferior to sorafenib for overall survival (OS) for first-line systemic treatment of HCC.4

Since the approval of sorafenib in 2008, one of the most important unmet needs in the treatment of HCC has been the development of agents that improve outcomes after disease progression during sorafenib treatment.

To that end, several phase III trials evaluating novel drugs in this population were conducted, but until recently all failed to meet their primary endpoint of improving OS for these patients.5–8

PARAGRAPH

The oral multikinase inhibitor regorafenib blocks the activity of protein kinases involved in angiogenesis, oncogenesis, metastasis, and tumor immunity,9,10 and is approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors.11,12

After a single-arm, phase II trial of regorafenib in patients with HCC that had progressed on sorafenib showed evidence of acceptable tolerability and promising anti-tumor activity, the randomized, placebo-controlled phase III RESORCE trial was carried out.13,14

The results of RESORCE demonstrated that regorafenib significantly improves OS compared with placebo in patients with HCC who had radiologic progression during sorafenib treatment (hazard ratio [HR] 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50–0.78; p <0.0001).14,15

PARAGRAPH

This improvement in OS seen with regorafenib in the second-line setting in HCC may be the beginning of incremental improvements in outcomes, similar to those observed in other advanced cancers.

In patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer, the extension in survival seen over the past two decades – from a median of approximately one year to more than 30 months – can mainly be attributed to the introduction and sequencing of new effective therapies that target the molecular pathways involved in tumor growth and metastasis.16,17

These factors have also contributed to extended survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer18,19 and advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.20,21

Since regorafenib is the first drug to improve OS in patients with HCC who had disease progression on sorafenib, we conducted several retrospective analyses of RESORCE data to further investigate the safety and efficacy outcomes associated with this sequential treatment approach.

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

RESORCE study design

PARAGRAPH

RESORCE was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, phase III trial conducted at 152 centers in 21 countries (NCT01774344).

Details of the RESORCE trial have been published elsewhere.14

Patients with HCC who had radiologic progression during sorafenib treatment and who tolerated sorafenib (they must have received ≥400 mg daily for at least 20 days of the last 28 days before discontinuation) were randomized 2:1 to oral regorafenib 160 mg once daily for the first three weeks of each four-week cycle or matching placebo.

All patients received best supportive care.

Patients had to be randomized at least two weeks but not more than 10 weeks following their last sorafenib dose.

Treatment continued until disease progression, death, or unacceptable toxicity.

The trial was approved by each site’s institutional review board or ethics committee.

All patients provided informed consent.

SECTION

Outcomes and assessments

PARAGRAPH

In RESORCE, OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause.

Time to progression (TTP) was defined as the time from randomization to radiologic or clinical disease progression.

Disease progression was measured using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 and modified RECIST for HCC (mRECIST).

Safety was assessed by the frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events.

Adverse events were graded using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.03.

PARAGRAPH

In the exploratory analyses, efficacy and safety outcomes were assessed in subgroups of patients based on the last dose of sorafenib received (800 mg/day or <800 mg/day, defined as the dose received during the last 24 h period before discontinuation) prior to entering RESORCE.

In addition, TTP during RESORCE was analyzed by TTP during prior sorafenib treatment.

The goal of these analyses was to better define the safety and efficacy of regorafenib based on baseline clinical characteristics, prior sorafenib exposure, and tolerability.

PARAGRAPH

Additional analyses carried out on the full cohort of patients in RESORCE included time from the start of prior sorafenib treatment to the start of study drug in RESORCE, time from the start of prior sorafenib treatment until disease progression on study drug in RESORCE, and time from the start of prior sorafenib treatment until death in RESORCE.

SECTION

Statistical analyses

PARAGRAPH

Hazard ratios and 95% CIs for OS and TTP for the full cohort of patients in RESORCE were calculated using the stratified Cox model.

HRs and 95% CIs for subgroups of patients (Asia; rest of world; last sorafenib dose 800 mg; last sorafenib dose <800 mg) were calculated using the unstratified Cox model.

Medians were computed using Kaplan–Meier estimates.

All other analyses were descriptive.

All p values are 2-sided.

Results

SECTION

Prior treatments including sorafenib

PARAGRAPH

A total of 573 patients were randomized to receive either regorafenib (n = 379) or placebo (n = 194).14

The treatment groups were balanced with respect to baseline demographics and disease characteristics, and details have been previously reported.14

The groups were also balanced regarding the use of prior local therapies, with 58% of patients overall having received prior transarterial chemoembolization (Table 1).

The median duration of prior sorafenib treatment was 7.8 months in both groups and 60% of patients received the full sorafenib dose (800 mg/day) as the last dose prior to entering RESORCE (Table 1).

In the two groups, the median time from the start of sorafenib treatment to progression on sorafenib was similar (7.2 months for regorafenib; 7.1 months for placebo), as was the time from the start of sorafenib treatment to the start of study drug in RESORCE (Table S1).

SECTION

Outcomes

PARAGRAPH

For the overall population, the median OS (from randomization to death) was 10.6 months with regorafenib vs. 7.8 months with placebo (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.50–0.78; p <0.0001; Table S2).

An updated OS analysis, conducted nearly one year after the primary analysis, showed similar results (medians 10.7 vs. 7.9 months; HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.50–0.75; p <0.0001).

Estimated survival rates were higher in the regorafenib group than in the placebo group through 30 months, with one-year survival rates of 45% and 29%, respectively (Table S3).

When survival was assessed from the time of the start of prior sorafenib, the median time to death in RESORCE was 26.0 months in the regorafenib group and 19.2 months in the placebo group (Table 2).

A similar improvement in median survival from the time of the start of sorafenib to death in the regorafenib group vs. placebo was seen in Asian and non-Asian patients.

Estimated survival rates from the start of sorafenib to death were higher in the regorafenib group from 12 months through 72 months (Table 3).

PARAGRAPH

Analysis of the subgroups of patients who received 800 mg/day and <800 mg/day as the last sorafenib dose showed that the HRs (regorafenib/placebo; 95% CI) for OS in the two groups were similar: 0.67 (0.51–0.88) and 0.68 (0.48–0.96), respectively (Fig. S1).

Among patients who received 800 mg/day as the last sorafenib dose, median OS (95% CI) was 10.6 months (8.1–12.6) for regorafenib and 7.0 months (5.3–9.0) for placebo.

Among those who received <800 mg/day as the last sorafenib dose, median OS (95% CI) was 10.6 months (8.0–14.0) for regorafenib and 8.5 months (5.6–10.0) for placebo.

PARAGRAPH

To assess whether TTP during prior sorafenib treatment had an impact on TTP in RESORCE, patients were divided into four subgroups based on their quartile of TTP (time to radiologic progression) during prior sorafenib treatment (Table S4).

Regorafenib showed a consistent TTP benefit over placebo irrespective of TTP on prior sorafenib, with HRs ranging from 0.26 to 0.66 (Table 4).

SECTION

Safety

PARAGRAPH

There were no pronounced differences in the frequencies of the most common treatment-emergent adverse events in subgroups of patients based on the last sorafenib dose received (800 mg/day or <800 mg/day; Table 5).

Among regorafenib-treated patients, hand–foot skin reaction occurred in 50% and 58%, diarrhea in 42% and 40%, and hypertension in 31% and 29% of patients who received a last sorafenib dose of 800 mg/day and <800 mg/day, respectively.

Fatigue was more common among regorafenib-treated patients who received <800 mg/day (50%) than among those who had received 800 mg/day as the last sorafenib dose (36%), as was anorexia (<800 mg/day, 40%; 800 mg/day, 25%).

Rates of grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events in regorafenib-treated patients were 64% and 71% in patients who received a last sorafenib dose of 800 mg/day and <800 mg/day, respectively.

Among regorafenib-treated patients, grade 3 hand–foot skin reaction occurred in 10% and 17%, grade 3 fatigue in 8% and 11%, and grade 3 anorexia in 2% and 4% of patients who received a last sorafenib dose of 800 mg/day and <800 mg/day, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

Rates of hepatobiliary disorders were similar regardless of the last sorafenib dose, and were higher in the placebo group than the regorafenib group (800 mg/day: 10% [regorafenib] vs. 17% [placebo]; <800 mg/day: 12% vs. 18%, respectively) (Table S5).

Increased bilirubin of grade 3 or 4 severity appeared more commonly among regorafenib-treated patients whose last sorafenib dose was <800 mg/day (14% [regorafenib] vs. 8% [placebo]) compared with those whose last sorafenib dose was 800 mg/day (9% [regorafenib] vs. 12% [placebo]).

Increased aspartate aminotransferase of grade 3 or 4 severity occurred at the same rate in the two treatment groups regardless of the last sorafenib dose (800 mg/day: 12% [regorafenib] vs. 11% [placebo]; <800 mg/day: 12% vs. 12%, respectively).

Rates of increased alanine aminotransferase of grade 3 or 4 severity were low across the treatment groups regardless of the last sorafenib dose (800 mg/day: 4% [regorafenib] vs. 3% [placebo]; <800 mg/day: 3% vs. 3%, respectively).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The RESORCE trial showed that regorafenib significantly improves survival compared with placebo as second-line therapy in patients with HCC who had radiologic progression during sorafenib treatment.14

The current exploratory analysis of RESORCE shows that regorafenib provided a clinical benefit irrespective of the last sorafenib dose and irrespective of TTP during prior sorafenib treatment.

PARAGRAPH

Overall, 60% of patients in RESORCE received 800 mg/day as their last sorafenib dose, suggesting that they either received the full dose throughout the course of sorafenib treatment, or that they had their dose re-escalated.

An exploratory subgroup analysis showed that the survival benefit in patients treated with regorafenib was similar regardless of the last sorafenib dose (800 mg/day or <800 mg/day).

The safety profile of regorafenib was generally consistent with that reported for regorafenib in other gastrointestinal malignancies,11,12 and rates of adverse events were generally similar when analyzed by the last sorafenib dose.

Among regorafenib-treated patients, rates of grade ≥3 adverse events of hand–foot skin reaction, fatigue, anorexia, and bilirubin elevations appeared somewhat higher in those who received a last sorafenib dose of <800 mg/day compared with 800 mg/day, but no difference among regorafenib-treated patients with regard to last sorafenib dose was observed in rates of hepatobiliary disorders or grade ≥3 adverse events of alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase elevations.

This suggests that the dose of prior sorafenib may not be indicative of the adverse event profile during subsequent regorafenib treatment.

Further interpretation of these results is not feasible because the collection of more detailed data about adverse events during prior sorafenib treatment was outside the scope of the RESORCE trial and those data were not collected during screening.

PARAGRAPH

To be eligible for RESORCE, patients had to have tolerated prior sorafenib (≥400 mg/day for at least 20 days of the last 28 days of treatment).

It is noteworthy that the observed median duration of prior sorafenib treatment in RESORCE (7.8 months)14 was substantially longer than the duration of sorafenib treatment in SHARP (5.3 months)1 and in the Asia-Pacific trial (3.1 months)2 (data on file).

It is unlikely that patients in RESORCE had a more favorable tumor biology than patients in other trials, because the median OS in the placebo arm of RESORCE (7.8 months) was comparable with that of the placebo arms of other recently completed global phase III trials of second-line therapy after sorafenib.5–7

The longer duration of sorafenib treatment in RESORCE compared with the SHARP and Asia-Pacific trials may reflect the improved management of adverse events or the selection of patients who tolerated sorafenib and who were eligible for second-line treatment into this trial.

PARAGRAPH

Our exploratory analysis of outcomes by quartile of TTP during prior sorafenib treatment showed that the TTP benefit for patients treated with regorafenib in RESORCE was comparable, independent of TTP on prior sorafenib.

This suggests that regorafenib confers TTP benefit regardless of the rate of progression on prior sorafenib treatment.

It is worth noting that in RESORCE, results for TTP were similar whether assessed by mRECIST or RECIST 1.1, with median TTPs of 3.2 vs. 1.5 months (regorafenib vs. placebo) by mRECIST and 3.9 vs. 1.5 months by RECIST1.1.14

PARAGRAPH

This is the first report of outcomes with the sequential use of sorafenib and regorafenib in HCC.

Our exploratory analysis showed that patients treated with sorafenib followed by regorafenib had a median (95% CI) time from the start of sorafenib treatment to death of 26.0 months (22.6–28.1) compared with 19.2 months (16.3–22.8) for those treated with sorafenib followed by placebo.

This difference between the treatment groups (regorafenib vs. placebo) in the time from the start of sorafenib treatment to death was similar in Asian and non-Asian subgroups.

At 36 months from the time of the start of sorafenib, estimated survival rates were 31% for regorafenib and 20% for placebo.

We observed that the difference between the treatment groups in the median time from the start of sorafenib treatment to death was greater than the difference in the median OS values between the treatment groups in RESORCE.14

Patients were randomly assigned and the treatment groups were similar with respect to the median duration of prior sorafenib and the time interval between last sorafenib treatment and the start of RESORCE.

The two treatment arms were also balanced at randomization for baseline demographics, disease characteristics, and relevant prognostic factors.

Despite this, the difference in the medians for OS in RESORCE and the time from the start of sorafenib treatment to death is not unexpected because within each treatment arm, the distribution of individual patients’ time periods prior to and after randomization was likely different.

The median OS from the start of sorafenib to death in RESORCE is not simply the sum of the individual time periods (median TTP on prior sorafenib plus the time interval between progression on prior sorafenib and randomization in RESORCE plus median OS in RESORCE); rather, it reflects the variability in individual values within the treatment arms.

The median OS of 26 months from the start of sorafenib treatment in the regorafenib arm suggests that sequential systemic treatments may be changing the natural history of advanced HCC.

PARAGRAPH

Limitations of these analyses include the retrospective nature of some of the assessments and the small sample sizes in subgroups defined by TTP quartile on prior sorafenib.

However, the benefit we observed with sequential systemic treatment suggests that new effective treatments may lead to incremental improvements in survival in HCC, similar to those seen in other cancers such as metastatic colorectal cancer, where the sequential use of effective therapies may have contributed to a more than doubling of median OS over the past 20 years.16

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, exploratory analyses of the RESORCE trial results suggest that in patients with HCC who had radiologic progression on sorafenib treatment, regorafenib conferred a similar clinical benefit regardless of last sorafenib dose or TTP on prior sorafenib.

Rates of adverse events were generally similar irrespective of last sorafenib dose.

The results presented here suggest that for certain patients with HCC who no longer benefit from resection, local ablation, or chemoembolization, treatment with the sequence of sorafenib followed by regorafenib may extend survival beyond what has been previously reported.
