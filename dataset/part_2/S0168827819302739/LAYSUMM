TITLE

Activated hepatic stellate cells and portal fibroblasts contribute to cholestatic liver fibrosis in MDR2 knockout mice

PARAGRAPH

Activated portal fibroblasts and hepatic stellate cells, but not fibrocytes, contributed to the production of the fibrous scar in livers of Mdr2−/− mice, and these cells can serve as targets for antifibrotic therapy in cholestatic injury.

Therapeutic inhibition of the enzyme NADPH oxidase (NOX) in Mdr2−/− mice reversed cholestatic fibrosis, suggesting that targeting NOXs may be an effective strategy for the treatment of cholestatic fibrosis.
