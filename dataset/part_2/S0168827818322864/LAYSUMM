TITLE

Pregnancy in idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension: A multicentric study on maternal and fetal management and outcome

PARAGRAPH

About 15% of patients with idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension are women of childbearing age, who can become pregnant.

As available reports on pregnancy in these women are scarce and heterogeneous, it is unclear whether or not pregnancy should be contraindicated in this setting.

We provide detailed data showing that, regardless of the associated conditions, the overall outcome of women with idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension becoming pregnant is good despite a significant incidence of complications related to portal hypertension, and that fetal outcome is favorable in most pregnancies reaching 20â€¯weeks of gestation.
