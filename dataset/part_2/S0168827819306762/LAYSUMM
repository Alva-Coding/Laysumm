TITLE

The Phosphatidylethanolamine Biosynthesis Pathway Provides a New Target for Cancer Chemotherapy

PARAGRAPH

The early stages of human liver development were modeled using human hepatic organoids.

We identified a pathway that was essential for early liver development.

Based upon this finding, a novel combination drug therapy was identified that could be used to treat primary liver cancer and possibly other types of cancer.
