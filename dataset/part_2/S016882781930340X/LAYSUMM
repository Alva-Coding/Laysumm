TITLE

Reduction of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in cholangiocarcinoma by ex vivo targeting immune checkpoint molecules

PARAGRAPH

The defense functions of immune cells are suppressed in cholangiocarcinoma tumors.

Stimulating or blocking “immune checkpoint” molecules expressed on tumor-infiltrating T cells can enhance the defense functions of these cells.

Therefore, these molecules may be promising targets for therapeutic stimulation of immune cells to eradicate the tumors and prevent cancer recurrence in patients with cholangiocarcinoma.
