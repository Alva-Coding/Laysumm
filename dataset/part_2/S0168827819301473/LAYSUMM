TITLE

Syntenin regulates hepatitis C virus sensitivity to neutralizing antibody by promoting E2 secretion through exosomes

PARAGRAPH

This study identifies a key role for syntenin in the regulation of E2 secretion via exosomes.

Efficient production of E2-coated exosomes was shown to make hepatitis C virus less sensitive to antibody neutralization.

These results may have implications for the development of a hepatitis C virus vaccine.
