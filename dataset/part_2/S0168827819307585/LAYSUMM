TITLE

A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of emricasan in patients with NASH and F1-F3 fibrosis

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by fat accumulation in liver cells, which leads to inflammation and fibrosis.

Emricasan was previously shown to inhibit some of the liver enzymes which lead to liver inflammation and fibrosis.

In this study, emricasan did not improve liver inflammation or fibrosis in patients with NASH and pre-existing liver fibrosis.
