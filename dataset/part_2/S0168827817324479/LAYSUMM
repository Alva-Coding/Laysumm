TITLE

Impact of real-time metabolomics in liver transplantation: Graft evaluation and donor-recipient matching

PARAGRAPH

Real-time metabolomic profiles of human grafts during back-table can accurately predict graft dysfunction.

High lactate and phosphocholine content are highly predictive of graft dysfunction whereas low lactate and phosphocholine content characterize patients with sarcopenia.

In these patients, the cost of metabolic adaptation may explain the poor outcomes.
