ABSTRACT

TITLE

Non-invasive response prediction in prophylactic carvedilol therapy for cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices

PARAGRAPH

Non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs) are the mainstay of primary prophylaxis of esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis.

We investigated whether non-invasive markers of portal hypertension correlate with hemodynamic responses to NSBBs in cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices.

PARAGRAPH

In this prospective cohort study, 106 cirrhotic patients with high-risk esophageal varices in the derivation cohort received carvedilol prophylaxis, and completed paired measurements of hepatic venous pressure gradient, liver stiffness (LS), and spleen stiffness (SS) at the beginning and end of dose titration.

LS and SS were measured using acoustic radiation force impulse imaging.

A prediction model for hemodynamic response was derived, and subject to an external validation in the validation cohort (63 patients).

PARAGRAPH

Hemodynamic response occurred in 59 patients (55.7%) in the derivation cohort, and in 33 patients (52.4%) in the validation cohort, respectively.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that ΔSS was the only significant predictor of hemodynamic response (odds ratio 0.039; 95% confidence interval 0.008–0.135; p <0.0001).

The response prediction model (ModelΔSS = 0.0490–2.8345 × ΔSS; score = (exp[ModelΔSS])/(1 + exp[ModelΔSS]) showed good predictive performance (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.803) using 0.530 as the threshold value.

The predictive performance of the ModelΔSS in the validation set improved using the same threshold value (AUC = 0.848).

PARAGRAPH

A new model based on dynamic changes in SS exhibited good performance in predicting hemodynamic response to NSBB prophylaxis in patients with high-risk esophageal varices.
