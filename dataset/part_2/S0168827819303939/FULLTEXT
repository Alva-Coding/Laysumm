TITLE

The global epidemiology of NAFLD and NASH in patients with type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, with a global prevalence of 25.2%.1

NAFLD is defined by the presence of hepatic steatosis, detected either by imaging or histology, and a lack of secondary causes of hepatic fat accumulation (i.e. excessive alcohol consumption, steatogenic medication, or monogenic hereditary disorders).2

PARAGRAPH

Clinically, patients with NAFLD tend to have components of metabolic syndrome such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hyperlipidemia and hypertension.3–5

Among these comorbidities, T2DM seems to be the most important risk factor for having NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and the most important clinical predictor of adverse clinical outcomes such as advanced hepatic fibrosis and mortality.6–10

A recent meta-analysis reported the global prevalence of T2DM as 22.51% among patients with radiologically defined NAFLD.1

On the other hand, the same study suggested that the prevalence of T2DM among histologically proven NASH patients is 43.63%.1

Other studies suggested the prevalence of NAFLD by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and the prevalence of histologically proven NASH in patients with T2DM and normal liver enzymes are 50% and 56%; respectively.11

These data support the bidirectional relationship between T2DM and NAFLD/NASH, which share a common pathogenic mechanism.12,13

It is also important to note that the long-term outcomes of patients with NAFLD, such as the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, liver-related mortality and overall mortality, also seem to be adversely impacted by the presence of T2DM.14–16

In a recent analysis, the expected increases in the incidence of diabetes and obesity in the United States were projected to cause tremendous increases in the disease burden of NASH and its complications.17

In this context, it is important to remember that NAFLD accounts for roughly 75.1% of chronic liver disease cases in the United States18 and is a potentially underlying cause of hepatocellular carcinoma in 14.1% of all cases.19

Additionally, NAFLD/NASH is among the top 3 indications for liver transplantation in the United States.5,20,21

In all these scenarios, T2DM seems to be a major driver of disease burden and disease progression among patients with NAFLD.

Despite these data, there is a substantial lack of awareness among clinicians and policy makers.22

Therefore, the aim of this study is to use meta-analytic systematic review methodology to summarize the global prevalence of NAFLD and NASH among patients with T2DM.

Search terms

PARAGRAPH

The study was conducted and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (http://www.prismastatement.org/).

PARAGRAPH

Ovid MEDLINE®, PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched for English language studies with information on NAFLD or NASH in T2DM, published from January 1989 to September 2018.

Three of the authors performed the literature search using the keywords: (“NAFLD”, “non-alcoholic fatty liver disease”, “NASH” “non-alcoholic steatohepatitis” and “fatty liver”) and (“Type 2 diabetes”, “diabetes mellitus”, “diabetes”).

The studies included were cross-sectional, longitudinal, or descriptive studies conducted in adults (age 18 or older) and published in peer-reviewed journals between 1989 and September 2018 (Table S1).

SECTION

Study exclusion criteria

PARAGRAPH

Exclusion criteria for the meta-analysis were as follows: i) the study was a review article or abstract; ii) the study did not identify patients with NAFLD; iii) the study was in a pediatric population (<18 years old); iv) the study did not exclude other causes of liver disease, such as viral hepatitis B and C (HBV/HCV); v) the study did not report screening for excess alcohol consumption; vi) the study reported type 1 diabetes, vii) the study included only groups with a specific metabolic condition, such as morbidly obese; viii) the study was not published in English (Fig. 1).

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

The prevalence in each study was computed using raw data (i.e. the number of cases divided by the study sample size).

As needed, the reported prevalence (%) and the sample size were used to impute a missing number of cases.

When longitudinal studies reported prevalence at different time periods, the overall period prevalence for the time period was used.

To estimate the pooled prevalence, the prevalence rates were combined in a random-effects meta-analysis (normal-normal model) that accounted for between-study heterogeneity.

For better statistical properties, we use the logit transformed proportions for the meta-analysis.23,24

Between-study heterogeneity was estimated by the restricted maximum likelihood estimator25 and assessed by the Q (i.e. a significant Q statistic suggests moderators should be explored) and I2-statistic26 (i.e. % of total variability due to heterogeneity; values ≥75% indicating heterogeneity) and by comparing results from studies grouped according to study-level characteristics (country, region, age group, obesity, and diagnostic method).

According to scientific objections against an assessment of study quality27 and the lack of necessary information in the included studies (sampling frame, method, representativeness of general population, and so on), we did not exclude low-quality studies as a sensitivity analysis.

Instead, meta-regression analyses using mixed-effects models were performed to explore and explain the diversity among the results of different studies.

The percentage of males, the mean age of the sample, mean body mass index (BMI), geographic regions, diagnostic method, follow-up time, publication year, and year of start/end data collection were examined univariately and also jointly in a single meta-regression model.

The multivariable models were selected by considering collinearity and maximizing the proportional decrease of heterogeneity.

Model coefficients were tested using the Knapp and Hartung adjustment.28

Pairwise comparisons for categorical moderators were calculated using Holm’s method.29

Primary analyses were restricted to studies which used ultrasound or proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS) for diagnosis.

Secondary analyses were performed on studies that used any type of diagnostic technique.

SECTION

Global and regional estimates of prevalence

PARAGRAPH

In order to estimate the prevalence rates regionally and globally, we performed a random-effects meta-analysis for each country on the prevalence and then calculated a weighted mean prevalence by the total population in each country for the latest available year (2014–2017).30

SECTION

Prevalence of NASH and advanced fibrosis

PARAGRAPH

Ten studies estimating the prevalence of NASH and 7 studies estimating the prevalence of advanced fibrosis in biopsied T2DM patients with NAFLD were identified.

The global prevalence of NAFLD among patients with T2DM was approximated by the product of the global prevalence of NAFLD among patients with T2DM and the global prevalence of NASH/advanced fibrosis in biopsied patients with T2DM and NAFLD.

The confidence intervals were estimated by Delta method.31

Because of small sample sizes, the regional prevalence was not estimated.

The influence of individual studies was explored by serially excluding each study as a sensitivity analysis.

PARAGRAPH

A funnel plot, Begg-Mazumdar’s rank correlation test32 and Egger’s regression test33 were used to assess the presence of any publication or related biases.

All analyses were performed using the metafor package34 and SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Statistical tests were considered statistically significant at p <0.05 (two-tailed).

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

As shown in the study flow diagram (Fig. 1), our electronic search yielded 1,685 non-duplicated manuscripts.

A total of 110 articles were identified as potentially meeting our inclusion criteria and full-text articles were retrieved.

After the initial review of all full-text articles, 99 studies met the inclusion criteria.

Due to the observed high heterogeneity by diagnostic methods, only 80 studies (74 ultrasound and 6 H-MRS) were used in subsequent meta-analyses.

SECTION

Patient characteristics in the studies included in the meta-analysis

PARAGRAPH

A total of 80 studies between 2003 and 2018 involving a total 49,419 patients with T2DM were included in the study, with a mean age of 58.5 years (range 25.7–70.0 years) and a mean BMI of 27.9 kg/m2 (range 24.0–34.2 kg/m2).

On average, 52.9% of patients with T2DM were male (range 27.5–86.3%) (Fig. 1 and Table 1).

Thirty-four studies (42.5%) were from East Asia, 26 studies (32.5%) were from Europe, 6 studies (7.5%) were from South Asia, 4 studies (5%) were from West Asia, 4 studies (5%) were from Africa, 3 studies (3.8%) were from the United States, and 3 studies (3.8%) were from Latin America.

Seventy-four studies (92.5%) diagnosed NAFLD using ultrasound and 6 studies (7.5%) via H-MRS.

Study characteristics and the reported prevalence of NAFLD are given in Table 1; the regional grouping of the included studies is presented in Table S1.

SECTION

Prevalence of NAFLD among patients with T2DM

PARAGRAPH

The estimated global NAFLD prevalence among patients with T2DM was 55.48% (95% CI 47.26–63.67%), with regional prevalences of 51.77% in the United States (95% CI 31.33–71.64%), 56.83% in Latin America (95% CI 34.05–76.98%), 67.97% in Europe (95% CI 62.07–72.98%), 52.04% in East Asia (95% CI 45.37–58.55%), 57.87% in South Asia (95% CI 52.87–62.68%), 67.29% in West Asia (95% CI 60.39–73.61%), and 30.39% in Africa (95% CI 11.64–67.09%).

Based on the global prevalence of T2DM (8.5%),35 the predicted prevalence of patients with T2DM and NAFLD was 47.16 per 1,000 global population (Fig. 2).

PARAGRAPH

Meta-analytic pooling of the prevalence estimates of NAFLD in patients with T2DM yielded a summary prevalence of 59.25 in the 80 studies included (k = 80; 95% CI 55.47–62.92).

Heterogeneity of effect sizes was still present (k = 80; Q = 3,235; p <0.01; I2 = 98.42%, where k indicates the number of studies), and was similar to that observed in the secondary analyses of studies which used all types of diagnostic methods (k = 99; Q = 27,888; p <0.01; I2 = 99.46%) (Tables 2 and S6).

Therefore, potential moderators were explored by stratified meta-analysis and meta-regression.

PARAGRAPH

Among patients with T2DM, the pooled prevalence of NAFLD diagnosed by ultrasound and H-MRS were 59.21% (k = 74; 95% CI 55.15–63.13; I2 = 98.60%) and 60.38% (k = 6; 95% CI 52.57–67.69; I2 = 79.81%) respectively (Table 2).

There is no significant difference between prevalence estimates made using ultrasound or H-MRS (p = 0.934).

Secondary analysis (k = 99) showed that the pooled prevalence of NAFLD diagnosed by any liver biopsy, non-invasive markers, and radiologic methods was 91.62% (k = 4; 95% CI 85.83–95.17; I2 = 35.39%), 67.63% (k = 6; 95% CI 53.06–79.42; I2 = 99.93%), and 58.37% (95% CI 54.71–62.34; I2 = 98.64%) respectively (Table S7).

PARAGRAPH

Assessment according to the geographic location of the study showed that studies from Europe (k = 26; 71.74%; I2 = 94.68%) reported the highest pooled prevalence of NAFLD in patients with T2DM, followed by West Asia (k = 4; 61.60%; I2 = 95.81%), South Asia (k = 6; 58.10%; I2 = 7.25%), Latin America (k = 3; 56.96%; I2 = 84.85%), East Asia (k = 34; 52.89%; I2 = 98.16%), the United States (k = 3; 51.77%; I2 = 96.10%), and Africa (k = 4; 31.95%; I2 = 97.53%) (Table 2).

A forest plot of the region-specific meta-analyses was presented in Fig. S1.

Secondary analysis (k = 99) showed that Latin America had the highest prevalence (k = 6; 73.78%, I2 = 95.31%) and other regions remained largely unchanged (Table S7).

PARAGRAPH

In univariable meta-regression analysis, geographic region (p <0.01) and mean BMI (p = 0.0318) were significantly associated with the prevalence rates, accounting for 35.27% and 6.25% of the heterogeneity.

Compared to the United States, Europe (OR 2.38; p = 0.017) reported higher prevalence of NAFLD among patients with T2DM, whereas studies from Africa (OR 0.46, p = 0.089) were associated with a lower prevalence, which was not statistically significant.

PARAGRAPH

For the multivariate analysis (MVA), we included 47 studies (58.9% of all studies) due to missing data.

Our MVA showed that geographic region (p <0.01), mean age (p = 0.033), male percentage (p = 0.741), mean BMI (p = 0.495), and end year of study data collection (p = 0.109) remained associated with the prevalence of NAFLD, accounting for 63.9% of the heterogeneity.

In fact, limiting analysis to these studies only yielded a prevalence estimate of 57.91% for NAFLD (95% CI 52.60–63.05; Q = 1,922; p <0.01; I2 = 98.86%).

Results of meta-regression analyses are summarized in Table 4 (Table S9 for secondary analysis).

SECTION

Prevalence of NAFLD among patients with T2DM by study-level characteristics

PARAGRAPH

The prevalence of NAFLD among patients with T2DM increased significantly with mean BMI (k = 70; 6.7% per BMI point increase; 95% CI 0.8–12.9%; test of moderator, Q = 4.98, p = 0.026).

PARAGRAPH

To provide a range of NAFLD prevalences in patients with T2DM, estimates were stratified by age group (<50, 50–59, ≥60) and obesity (overweight and obese).

The pooled NAFLD prevalence estimates among patients with T2DM, who were younger than 50 years of age ranged from 56.45% to 62.83%.

Additionally, when patients were assessed based on their BMI, the pooled NAFLD prevalence among overweight and obese patients with T2DM ranged from 57.71% to 64.36%.

No statistically significant difference in prevalence estimates was noted when studies were stratified by age group (test of moderator, Q = 2.20; p = 0.138) or obesity (test of moderator, Q = 2.36; p = 0.124).

There were no statistically significant differences in prevalence estimates when studies were stratified by publication year (test of moderator, Q = 1.10; p = 0.294) and sample size (test of moderator, Q = 0.78; p = 0.378) (Table 2).

SECTION

Mortality rates among patients with T2DM and NAFLD

PARAGRAPH

Only 2 studies (349 patients) reported mortality among patients with T2DM and NAFLD (40 all-cause mortality, 7 cardiovascular disease [CVD], and 6 liver-related deaths).

Both studies were carried out in the United States with average follow-up of 5.0 and 10.9 years.

Despite small sample sizes, the pooled all-cause, CVD, and liver-related mortalities of NAFLD in T2DM were 11.91% (95% CI 2.65–40.19; I2 = 95.15%), 2.11% (95% CI 0.43–9.72; I2 = 73.77%), and 1.62% (95% CI 0.17–13.84; I2 = 77.97%); respectively (Table S10).

SECTION

Comorbidities among T2DM stratified by presence or absence of NAFLD

PARAGRAPH

Compared to patients with T2DM only, patients with T2DM and NAFLD had higher rates of hypertension (56.96 vs. 55.01%), hyperlipidemia (46.69 vs. 43.08%), CVD (24.32 vs. 22.31%), peripheral arterial disease (9.14 vs. 7.99%), and cerebrovascular accident (9.00 vs. 9.02) (Table 3).

Secondary analysis showed that NAFLD was also significantly associated with a higher risk of hypertension (k = 37; OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.02–1.63; I2 = 97.18%) (Table S8).

SECTION

Prevalence of NASH among patients with T2DM

PARAGRAPH

A total of 10 studies between 2004 and 2018 including unique 892 biopsied patients with T2DM and NAFLD were retained in this analysis with a mean age of 55.0 years (range 50.7–58.0 years), 53.5% male (range 17.0–81.0%), and a mean BMI of 29.7 kg/m2 (range 24.8–34.4 kg/m2) (Fig. 1).

Data on the prevalence of NASH among biopsied patients with T2DM and NAFLD were available from the following 7 countries: USA (2 studies), Brazil (2 studies), Italy (1 study), Hong Kong (1 study), India (2 studies), Pakistan (1 study), and Australia (1 study).

The mean of reported NASH prevalence was 69.75% (range 37.29–96.83%) (Table S2).

PARAGRAPH

The estimated global prevalence of NASH among patients with T2DM was 37.33% (95% CI 24.70–50.02%).

The random-effects analysis of 10 studies yielded a summary prevalence of NASH of 71.29% (k = 10; 95% CI 56.88–82.38%) among biopsied patients with T2DM and NAFLD, with some between-study heterogeneity (Q = 66.1; p <0.01; I2 = 93.5%).

A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the presence of potential outliers, and 1 study was identified as an outlier.

Nevertheless, heterogeneity remained despite excluding the outlying study (Q = 49.8; p <0.01; I2 = 88.14%).

Univariable regression analyses revealed that moderators examined were not significantly associated with the prevalence of NASH (all p >0.10) even though country, mean age, duration, and start year of data collection explained 9.51%, 21.44%, 54.32%, 24.16% of the heterogeneity (Table S3).

A forest plot of the country-specific meta-analyses was presented in Fig. S2.

SECTION

Presence of advanced fibrosis among biopsied patients with T2DM and NAFLD

PARAGRAPH

A total of 7 published studies between 2004 and 2017 included 439 unique biopsied patients with NAFLD and T2DM (mean age of 55.0 years [range 51.0–57.2 years] and a mean BMI of 29.7 kg/m2 [range 24.8–34.4 kg/m2]) (Fig. 1).

Data on the prevalence of advanced fibrosis among biopsied patients with T2DM and NAFLD were available from the following 5 countries: Brazil (2 studies), Italy (1 study), Hong Kong (1 study), India (2 studies), and Australia (1 study).

The mean of reported advanced fibrosis prevalence was 22.01% (range 3.39–50.00%) (Table S4).

PARAGRAPH

The estimated global advanced fibrosis prevalence among patients with T2DM was 4.80% (95% CI 0.00–17.46%).

The random-effects analysis of 7 studies yielded a summary prevalence of advanced fibrosis of 17.02% (k = 7; 95% CI 7.29–34.86%) among biopsied T2DM with NAFLD), with significant evidence of between-study heterogeneity (Q = 66.8; p <0.01; I2 = 91.5%).

A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the presence of potential outliers, and 2 studies were identified.

The amount of heterogeneity remained present without the outlying studies (Q = 25.4; p <0.01; I2 = 80.89%).

Univariable regression analyses revealed that mean age (p = 0.014) was associated with the prevalence, accounting for 96.6% and 100% of the heterogeneity (Table S5).

A forest plot of the country-specific meta-analyses is presented in Fig. S3.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

This is an in-depth meta-analytic systematic review that assesses the global prevalence of NAFLD, NASH, and advanced fibrosis among patients with T2DM.

Additionally, we report a summary of all-cause, CVD and liver-related mortality in these patients.

PARAGRAPH

Our results show that the global prevalence of NAFLD among patients with T2DM is 55.5%, with the lowest prevalence reported from Africa (30.4%) and similarly high rates from the rest of the world.

In fact, these rates for the prevalence of NAFLD are almost twice the prevalence rates that had previously been reported for the general population from the same regions.2

Furthermore, these rates are similar to those previously reported for this patient population.36,37

PARAGRAPH

Not surprisingly, secondary analysis suggested heterogeneity for the prevalence of NAFLD based on the diagnostic methodology used to establish the diagnosis of NAFLD.

In fact, the NAFLD prevalence rates were 91.6% for individuals undergoing a liver biopsy, 67.6% based on non-invasive biomarkers and 58.6% based on the radiological modalities.

This data suggests a referral bias for those undergoing a liver biopsy, as well as indicating that histological diagnosis of hepatitis steatosis is more accurate.1

PARAGRAPH

In addition to the prevalence of NAFLD across the world, we also estimated the prevalence of metabolic comorbidities among patients with T2DM and NAFLD.

As expected, the vast majority of these patients met the definition of metabolic syndrome according to each study’s criteria.

Additionally, over half of these study participants had hyperlipidemia, almost 60% had hypertension, 24.3% had CVD and about 9.1% had peripheral arterial disease.38–41

These data are consistent with previous reports indicating the additive risk of both NASH and diabetes mellitus, resulting in a worse metabolic profile and a higher risk of CVD.42,43

In this context, this data should inform clinicians about risk assessment for CVD in patients with T2DM and underlying NASH.

PARAGRAPH

Another important aspect of this study is that we report the prevalence of NASH and advanced fibrosis in patients with T2DM and NAFLD who underwent a liver biopsy.

Our data demonstrated that the prevalence of NASH among biopsied patients with NAFLD and T2DM is 67.3%.

This estimate suggests that the overall prevalence of NASH in diabetics should be around 37.33% (95% CI 24.74–49.93).

Additionally, our data suggest that the prevalence of advanced fibrosis among biopsied patients with NAFLD and T2DM is 17.02% (95% CI 7.29–34.86).

Furthermore, our analysis suggests that patients with T2DM and NASH are younger, with slightly higher BMI.

These findings suggest that patients with T2DM and NASH may start a progressive course at a younger age and follow a more progressive course.

Therefore, these patients may require more aggressive management strategies, not only to avoid CVD complications but also liver-related adverse outcomes.

PARAGRAPH

In addition to the prevalence rates, our study also provides mortality rates for NAFLD and documented relatively high rates of overall mortality over a short period of follow-up (5–10 years).

Diabetics with NAFLD experienced an overall mortality rate as high as 585 per 100,000 people.

In fact, this rate is substantially higher compared to overall mortality rates of some other common chronic liver diseases, including chronic viral hepatitis.44–47

In this context, the overall mortality rate for hepatitis C patients in the United States ranges between 4.7 per 100,000 (2010) and 5.0 per 100,000 population (2014), while the overall mortality for hepatitis B patients is reported to be 0.5 per 100,000.44

In fact, mortality of NAFLD in diabetics is substantially higher than both HBV and HCV combined.

Furthermore, these rates are significantly higher than rates reported for other chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which had a mortality rate of 44.3 per 100,000 in men and 35.6 per 100,000 in women in 2014.45,47,48

Lastly, current literature suggests that severity of fibrosis is closely related with adverse outcomes in patients with NAFLD.49

All of these data support previous reports that diabetic patients with NASH have significantly higher mortality than other common liver and non-liver-related chronic diseases.6,8,16,50,51

PARAGRAPH

An important strength of our meta-analysis is the in-depth and standard methodology used for the literature search, the duration of study period (28 years) and the global nature of the study.

Also, to reduce possibility of bias, studies involving specific patient populations, like morbidly obese patients with very high prevalence of T2DM were excluded.

PARAGRAPH

Although the present study used the best available data to provide the global and regional prevalence estimates of NAFLD, NASH and advanced fibrosis among patients with T2DM, several limitations are important to consider.

First, there was some heterogeneity among individual studies which remained unexplained even after examining some of the potential moderators.

Unexamined factors, such as severity of liver disease and comorbid conditions of diabetes may have contributed to the heterogeneity.

However, the pooled prevalence estimates were largely unchanged after performing secondary meta-analyses of 99 studies that included all types of diagnostic methods, as well as of 47 studies that had complete information on moderators in our multivariable model and the stratified meta-analyses.

To further ensure the rigor of regional and global prevalence estimates, prevalence for each country was weighted by population size in each country, which may better reflect the true prevalence of NAFLD.

Second, we could not assess the quality of studies due to the fact that some study-specific data were not available (sample representativeness, sampling frames, and sampling techniques).

These differences in study quality may have introduced a possible bias.

Third, although this meta-analysis included a robust number of studies on NAFLD prevalence, there were comparatively fewer studies on NASH and advanced fibrosis.

Thus, we could not adequately assess potential moderators due to small sample sizes and a lack of statistical power.

Fourth, some variations caused by different diagnostic methodologies must be considered, in that, estimating the prevalence of NAFLD by liver enzymes would likely underestimate the true prevalence of NAFLD, compared to liver biopsy and imaging modalities.52

Also, estimating prevalence of NASH/advanced fibrosis by liver biopsy would likely overestimate the true prevalence of NASH/advanced fibrosis, as liver biopsy is only performed when clinically indicated.

Another limitation of our study was the exclusion of pediatric population.

In fact, the future burden of NAFLD can be substantially impacted by this group and understanding the epidemiology and outcomes of pediatric populations with T2DM will be critical.53

In addition, not many countries had actual data on the prevalence of NAFLD among T2DM.

Finally, since meta-regression analyses relied on aggregate data, it results in the loss or concealment of certain details of information due to the ecological fallacy.54,55

Therefore, this present study highlighted the need for countries to conduct their own studies to obtain their own prevalence data.

Despite these limitations, we believe we appropriately controlled for bias to the best of our ability.

No better methods are currently available to estimate the global or regional prevalence of NAFLD among patients with T2DM.

PARAGRAPH

In summary, our meta-analysis provides evidence that the prevalence of NAFLD and NASH in patients with T2DM is very high.

Additionally, a significant proportion of these patients have underlying advanced fibrosis and experience higher rates of adverse outcomes such as all-cause, CVD or liver-specific mortality.

In this context, T2DM not only fuels the epidemic of NAFLD but also promotes the progressiveness of adverse outcomes.

PARAGRAPH

Despite the important data provided by this meta-analysis, 2 important issues must be considered.

Currently, there is a lack of well-conducted studies assessing the prevalence and progressive nature of NAFLD in patients with T2DM.

These studies must be carried out in a prospective manner with carefully defined study definitions and validated outcomes.

Additionally, there must be close engagement and collaboration with experts in diabetes.

In fact, it will be only through collaborations between primary care, hepatology and diabetologists that we obtain a better understanding of the epidemiologic and clinical burden of NAFLD and NASH in the diabetic population.

These data could inform clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, payers and policy makers, highlighting not only the need to develop better non-invasive diagnostic tests and treatment regimens, but also to provide public health policies that deal with the root cause of NAFLD and T2DM, and provide coverage for the effective management of these patients.
