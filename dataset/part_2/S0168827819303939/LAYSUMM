TITLE

The global epidemiology of NAFLD and NASH in patients with type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now recognized as the most prevalent chronic liver disease worldwide.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an important risk factor for NAFLD.

Additionally, T2DM seems to accelerate the progression of liver disease in NAFLD.

Despite the high prevalence and serious clinical implications of NAFLD in patients with T2DM, it is usually overlooked in clinical practice.

This meta‚Äêanalysis provides evidence of the high prevalence of NAFLD and NASH in patients with T2DM.

In this context, increasing awareness about the importance of NAFLD in patients with T2DM among all important stakeholders (primary care physicians, specialists, and health policy makers) must be prioritized.
