TITLE

A polymorphism in the Irisin-encoding gene (FNDC5) associates with hepatic steatosis by differential miRNA binding to the 3â€²UTR

PARAGRAPH

Irisin is a novel protein produced mainly by muscle, which is known to be released into the circulation, with an unclear role in liver fat deposition.

This study demonstrates that genetic variants in the gene encoding the irisin protein modulate the risk of liver fat in patients with fatty liver disease.

Interestingly, these effects are independent of, but additive to those of other recently described genetic variants that contribute to liver fat.

In functional studies, we have deciphered the detailed molecular mechanisms by which this genetic variant mediates its effects.
