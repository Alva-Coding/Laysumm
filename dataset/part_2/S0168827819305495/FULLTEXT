TITLE

Clathrin switches transforming growth factor-β role to pro-tumorigenic in liver cancer

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Primary hepatic endocytic functions are important in several physiological and pathological processes.

Despite this, their molecular mechanisms remain poorly defined and remarkably understudied.1

Ligand-induced internalization and degradation of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-MET), are relevant for maintenance and inhibition of their signalling pathways.

Upon binding their respective ligands, each of these receptors are recruited into clathrin-coated pits eventually leading to endocytosis.

However, clathrin might play additional roles, since Akt signalling following EGFR or MET activation requires clathrin, but could not require receptor endocytosis.2

EGFR mediates differential signalling depending on its localization in the cell.3,4

At the plasma membrane, clathrin is present in microdomains,5,6 where EGFR clustering occurs.7

In these microdomains, clathrin may act as a scaffold protein, recruiting signalling adaptors.

In human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), levels of clathrin heavy-chain protein help to distinguish early HCC from benign tumours and its expression is stronger in poorly differentiated HCC than in well differentiated HCC.8–10

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms behind these results.

PARAGRAPH

In hepatocytes, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) induces both pro- and anti-apoptotic signals.11

The anti-apoptotic signals are mediated by the EGFR pathway, which is transactivated by TGF-β through a mechanism that involves EGFR ligands’ upregulation and activation of the metalloprotease TACE/ADAM17, responsible for their shedding.12–14

In HCC cells, TGF-β also upregulates the expression of EGFR ligands, which transactivates the EGFR pathway, counteracting its pro-apoptotic response.15

EGFR targeting knockdown, or pharmacological inhibition, significantly enhances TGF-β-induced cell death, correlating with higher levels of the NADPH oxidase NOX4 and changes in the expression of BCL-2 and IAP families.

Once cells overcome apoptosis, they respond to TGF-β by undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which confers migratory/invasive capacities and stem cell properties.16

PARAGRAPH

We have recently reported that caveolin-1, a protein involved in intracellular traffic for which a role in HCC has been proposed,17 is necessary for the TGF-β-induced transactivation of the EGFR,18 switching the response to TGF-β from cytostatic to tumorigenic in liver tumour cells.19

Much less is known about the potential role of clathrin in the TGF-β signalling in liver cells.

In hepatocytes, Dooley’s group described that blocking clathrin trafficking does not alter the canonical-SMAD phosphorylation induced by TGF-β,20 which indicates that clathrin-dependent endocytosis is not required for the early signals induced by TGF-β.

Nevertheless, the role of clathrin in other endocytosis-independent responses, or in the crosstalk between TGF-β and the EGFR pathway, is completely unknown.

More knowledge in this area is necessary to understand the role of clathrin in hepatocarcinogenesis.

PARAGRAPH

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to analyse the potential role of clathrin in TGF-β-induced signalling in liver cells and its relevance in liver cancer.

Results

SECTION

Clathrin expression is increased in tumoural tissues from patients with HCC and in a DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis model in mice

PARAGRAPH

Clathrin heavy-chain (CLTC gene; CHC17 isoform) mRNA expression was increased in matched samples of tumour compared to adjacent non-tumour tissues in a cohort of 60 patients with HCC, collected in the Bellvitge University Hospital (Fig. 1A-B).

Moreover, immunohistochemical analyses revealed that HCC tissues presented stronger clathrin staining than healthy tissue samples, which showed barely perceptible or moderate staining (Fig. 1C).

Clathrin localized in tumoural areas, with more intense expression at the tumoural borders.

To extend the analysis to a higher number of patients, we used the Chen Liver database (n = 196) and the TCGA database (n = 212), from Oncomine (https://www.oncomine.org).23

HCC tissues expressed higher levels of CLTC mRNA and had higher CLTC DNA copy numbers than normal tissue (Fig. S1A,B).

PARAGRAPH

Analysis of clathrin expression in a DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis model in mice also revealed that, at 9 months after treatment, clathrin mRNA (Cltc gene) and protein levels were higher in tumoural areas in comparison to non-tumoural areas (Fig. 1D).

Tumoural areas were identified by Ki67 staining (a proliferative marker).

PARAGRAPH

These data suggest that clathrin could play a role in hepatocarcinogenesis.

SECTION

CTLC knockdown unbalances pro- and anti-apoptotic signals induced by TGF-β through impairment of the EGFR pathway

PARAGRAPH

To analyse the specific role of clathrin in response to EGFR ligands and TGF-β, we induced CLTC knockdown through siRNA technology in mouse hepatocytes and in the HCC PLC/PRF/5 cell line (Fig. S2).

First, we analysed whether clathrin is required for cell responses to extracellular EGFR ligands.

In response to heparin binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), an EGFR ligand, clathrin downregulation attenuated EGFR, Akt and ERK (MAPK1) activation in both mouse hepatocytes and PLC/PRF/5 cells (Fig. 2).

Furthermore, in a proliferation functional assay, Ctlc knockdown hepatocytes exhibited lower proliferation rates, analysed by Ki67 immunofluorescence, in response to HB-EGF or FBS.

FACS cell cycle analysis also revealed that the increase in the % of cells in S-phase in response to these mitogens was significantly lower in Ctlc knockdown hepatocytes than in control cells (Fig. S3).

These results suggest that clathrin could be important for the induction of proliferative and survival signals by EGFR.

PARAGRAPH

In foetal hepatocytes and liver cancer cells, TGF-β simultaneously induces both pro- and anti-apoptotic signals whose final balance determines cell fate.11,24

TGF-β binding to specific TGF-β receptors induces phosphorylation of SMAD2/3.

At short time (30 min) after TGF-β treatment, phospho-SMAD2 did not show lower levels in Cltc knockdown mouse hepatocytes, compared to siControl cells (Fig. 3A).

Similarly, no differences were found in PLC/PRF/5 cells (Fig. 3B).

Indeed, clathrin is not necessary for TGF-β-mediated SMAD phosphorylation.

Next, we wondered whether CLTC knockdown cells showed alterations in the survival signals triggered by TGF-β, which involve EGFR phosphorylation.

Western blot analysis showed a decrease in EGFR and Akt phosphorylation in both TGF-β-treated hepatocytes and PLC/PRF/5 cells (Fig. 3A-B).

Curiously, levels of p-EGFR appeared to be higher in CLTC knockdown cells.

We previously described a SRC-dependent transactivation of the EGFR under serum withdrawal conditions in liver tumour cells.25

Since our experiments are performed in the absence of serum, the results might indicate that CLTC knockdown would favour this auto-transactivation of the EGFR.

However, higher phosphorylation of the EGFR and its downstream signals was not observed in response to TGF-β.

PARAGRAPH

In order to know whether the absence of clathrin could be affecting the membrane cell trafficking of EGFR, we performed EGFR confocal microscopy analysis.

We observed that in PLC/PRF/5 cells, clathrin colocalized with EGFR at the cell membrane and after TGF-β treatment both were internalized (Fig. S4A).

Cytosolic clathrin colocalized with the Golgi reticular system and the Pearson correlation coefficient increased in TGF-β-treated cells (Fig. S4B).

In CLTC knockdown cells, EGFR localized mainly in cytosolic compartments and no significant changes were observed after TGF-β treatment (Fig. S5A).

A similar pattern was observed in cells treated with dynasore (GTPase inhibitor of dynamin activity, which prevents endocytosis) (Fig. S5B).

These results together suggest that clathrin and endocytotic processes are required for the cell membrane trafficking of EGFR in liver tumour cells.

PARAGRAPH

Since CLTC knockdown cells showed alterations in the survival signals triggered by TGF-β, we analysed whether these cells were more sensitive to the pro-apoptotic effects of TGF-β.

CLTC knockdown liver cells showed an increased sensitivity to TGF-β in terms of cell death.

These differences were clearly visualized under microscopy (Fig. S6).

Furthermore, CLTC knockdown cells, after TGF-β treatment, exhibited a higher percentage of non-viable cells, compared to control cells, after 72 h of treatment, measured by flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide incorporation (Fig. 3C).

These results suggest that clathrin levels, through favouring the response to EGFR ligands, could unbalance the response to TGF-β in liver cells in favour of anti-apoptotic signals.

SECTION

TGF-β upregulates clathrin expression in liver tumour cells

PARAGRAPH

The analysis of CLTC and TGFB1 expression in different HCC cell lines revealed a positive correlation between CLTC and TGFB1 mRNA levels (Fig. 4A), correlating with the cell phenotype.

Indeed, epithelial HCC cells showed lower expression of both genes, while mesenchymal HCC cells expressed higher levels.

Likewise, the same result was observed for clathrin by western blot (Fig. 4B).

These results suggested a possible regulation of clathrin expression by TGF-β.

Corroborating this, both hepatocytes and PLC/PRF/5 cells showed higher protein levels of clathrin after TGF-β treatment, which in the case of PLC/PRF/5 significantly correlated with higher mRNA levels of CLTC at 72 h after TGF-β treatment (Fig. 4C,D).

These results indicate a positive correlation between clathrin and TGF-β.

SECTION

CLTC knockdown sensitizes liver tumour mesenchymal HCC cells to the pro-apoptotic effects of TGF-β

PARAGRAPH

HCC cell lines used in this work had already been described to respond with different gene expression profiles to TGF-β treatment: the early gene signature defined a pro-apoptotic and cytostatic response, whereas the late TGF-β signature defined an anti-apoptotic and invasive response.26

PLC/PRF/5, Huh7 and Hep3B cell lines belong to the early TGF-β signature group, while mesenchymal HLF and SNU449 cell lines belong to the late TGF-β signature group.

We previously found that autocrine TGF-β expression is high in mesenchymal-like HCC cells, which are resistant to its pro-apoptotic signals and respond to it inducing EMT, migration and invasion.

Thus, we wondered whether the high expression of CLTC could be responsible for the lack of pro-apoptotic response to TGF-β in the mesenchymal cell lines.

We chose SNU449 due to its mesenchymal phenotype and its higher expression levels of both clathrin and TGF-β, in comparison with PLC/PRF/5 which expressed lower levels of both proteins and had an epithelial phenotype.

CLTC knockdown in SNU449 cells (Fig. 5A) attenuated the phosphorylation of EGFR in response to either HB-EGF or TGF-β (Fig. S7) and sensitizes them to the pro-apoptotic effects of TGF-β, analysed by propidium iodide incorporation and % of cells with a DNA content lower than 2C – SubG1 cells (Fig. 5B-D).

Interestingly, TGF-β receptor I (TβRI, ALK5 gene) knockdown cells showed a decrease in basal CLTC expression (Fig. S8), which suggests that autocrine production of TGF-β in mesenchymal-invasive cells mediates upregulation of clathrin expression, favouring its pro-tumorigenic actions.

SECTION

Levels of clathrin in HCC cells affect the response to TGF-β in terms of upregulation of the pro-apoptotic mediator NOX4

PARAGRAPH

TGF-β requires reactive oxygen species (ROS) production to induce apoptosis in liver cells,27,28 an effect that is counteracted by the EGFR pathway28 (scheme in Fig. 6A).

ROS are mainly produced through the NADPH oxidase NOX4, which is upregulated by TGF-β, an effect that is counteracted by the EGFR pathway.29,30

In fact, NOX4 plays a liver tumour suppressor role.31

Interestingly, CLTC knockdown PLC/PRF/5 and SNU449 cells showed higher protein levels of NOX4 compared to control cells (Fig. 6B).

Analysis of ROS production and NOX4 mRNA expression in TGF-β-treated CLTC knockdown cells showed higher ROS production, correlating with upregulation of NOX4 mRNA levels in both cell lines (Fig. 6C-D) compared to control cells.

PARAGRAPH

We next wondered whether the overexpression of CLTC in the PLC/PRF/5 cells could confer resistance to the pro-apoptotic effects of TGF-β.

CLTC overexpressing cells (Fig. S9) showed higher basal mRNA levels of TGFB1 and lower expression of NOX4 compared to control cells.

Furthermore, clathrin overexpression provided resistance to the pro-apoptotic effects of TGF-β, preventing cell death.

PARAGRAPH

These results suggest that clathrin, due to its role in favouring the EGFR anti-apoptotic pathway, impairs NOX4 upregulation and ROS production by TGF-β in liver tumour cells, which would in turn inhibit its pro-apoptotic effects and favour its pro-tumorigenic response.

SECTION

Relevance of the expression of CLTC and TGFB1 on the prognosis and overall survival of patients with HCC

PARAGRAPH

Next, we decided to evaluate expression of CLTC, TGFB1 and EGFR genes in the HCC patient samples cohort (n = 60).

Notably, CLTC expression positively correlated with TGFB1 and EGFR expressions (Fig. 7A).

To expand the analysis to a higher number of patients we used the TCGA database (n = 369), with the aim of performing a bioinformatic analysis of the importance of TGFB1 and CLTC gene expression in HCC prognosis and overall survival.

We found that higher expression of TGFB1 predisposes patients with HCC to lower overall survival (hazard ratio 1.84; 95% CI 1.13–2.98; p = 0.019).

High CLTC expression tends to indicate a poor prognosis (hazard ratio 1.33; 95% CI 0.78–2.28; p = 0.312).

Next, we defined a cohort of patients where the expression of both genes was high (average expression + 1SD) (Fig. S10A).

In this patient cohort, a positive correlation between TGFB1 and CLTC was also found (Fig. S10B).

Interestingly, patients with a high combined scored for both genes had a significantly lower overall survival (3.22; 95% CI 1.45–7.13; p = 0.013) (Fig. 7C), compared with the effect of high expression of each gene separately.

Finally, we decided to analyse the overall survival for CLTC expression in patients (n = 358) stratified according to high (NHigh = 54) or low (NOther = 304) TGFB1 expression (Fig. 7C).

It is worth mentioning that CLTC expression had no prognostic value in those patients where TGFB1 expression was not high, whereas high TGFB1 expression significantly decreased the overall survival of patients that expressed high levels of CLTC.

Interestingly, when we focused on the analysis of some mesenchymal genes whose expression was related to TGF-β in HCC cells, such as CXCR4 or CD44,32,33 patients with higher expression of both TGFB1 and CLTC had higher expression levels of these mesenchymal genes in comparison to patients who expressed lower levels of TGFB1 and CLTC (Fig. S11).

All these results indicate that CLTC expression influences the prognosis and overall survival of patients with HCC and high expression of TGFB1.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

HCC is one of the most common types of cancer and is associated with a very poor prognosis, mainly due to the heterogeneity of the tumours and the lack of effective targeted therapy.

Drugs with a wide action, such as sorafenib or other multikinase inhibitors, have shown only modest efficacy.

Considering this, it seemed rational to focus on crucial cellular mechanisms, common to different intracellular signals, as potential therapeutic targets.

This was the initial idea behind this work, which aimed to study the role of clathrin, an essential protein involved in endocytosis and signalling of multiple tyrosine kinase receptors, in liver tumorigenesis.

Initial analysis indicated that CLTC gene expression was significantly increased in a large percentage of patients with HCC (Fig. 1, Fig. S1).

Furthermore, we confirmed an increase in the protein levels of clathrin in tumours, particularly in the peritumoural area, compared to tissues from healthy patients or the non-tumoural areas of the same patients.

In agreement with this result, in the model of DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in mice, we observed higher expression of the gene (Cltc) and increased levels of clathrin in tumoural areas compared to non-tumoural areas (Fig. 1).

This encouraging result that, surprisingly, had not been explored before, pushed us to analyse the relevance of clathrin expression in the response of an immortalized cell line of mouse hepatocytes and an HCC cell line, PLC/PRF/5, both of them used in our previous studies to analyse EGFR and TGF-β signalling.14,15,18

PARAGRAPH

According to our data, clathrin is essential for the hepatocyte and liver tumour cell response to EGFR ligands, such as HB-EGF, in terms of full EGFR/Akt/ERKs phosphorylation and cell proliferation (Fig. 2 and Fig. S3).

After ligand binding, EGFRs are recruited to clathrin-coated pits and their phosphorylation is amplified by clustering platforms that promote the dimerization and activation of unliganded EGFRs34 and protect the signalling complex from membrane phosphatases.35

Endocytosis to early endosomes seems to be a requirement for full ERK activation.36

Phosphorylation of Gab1 and Akt following EGFR activation also requires clathrin.2

These data suggest that clathrin downregulation might reduce active phosphorylated EGFR at the plasma membrane and endosomes, as previously suggested.37

PARAGRAPH

The anti-apoptotic response induced by TGF-β in hepatocytes and HCC cells requires the transactivation of EGFR through increases in the expression and shedding of EGFR ligands.11,12,15

Due to clathrin’s role in EGFR signalling, we hypothesized that it would also be required for the non-canonical signalling of TGF-β.

Attenuation of clathrin expression could also potentiate the canonical pathways and their functions, with increased and/or longer phosphorylation of SMAD2/3.

Both effects would contribute to an increase in the pro-apoptotic actions of TGF-β.

We observed only a slight increase in the levels of phospho-SMAD2 in CLTC knockdown hepatocytes and no changes in PLC/PRF/5 cells (Fig. 3).

In contrast, an impairment in TGF-β-induced EGFR and Akt phosphorylation, which correlated with an increase in TGF-β-induced apoptosis, was observed in both CLTC knockdown hepatocytes and PLC/PRF/5 cells (Fig. 3 and Fig. S6).

Clathrin would be required for a correct membrane traffic, dynamin-dependent, of the EGFR between Golgi and the cell membrane (Fig. S4 and S5).

PARAGRAPH

Increases in TGF-β-induced apoptosis in knockdown cells correlated with higher levels of NOX4 and ROS production after TGF-β treatment.

Upregulation of NOX4 by TGF-β is required for its pro-apoptotic activity (Fig. 6).

The EGFR pathway inhibits NOX4 expression, acting at the transcriptional level on the NOX4 promoter.29

In this sense, clathrin downregulation could impair the inhibition of NOX4 by EGFR and could promote the pro-apoptotic role of TGF-β.

Inhibition of NOX4 in liver cells might lead to pro-tumorigenic processes.

NOX4 plays a role in regulating liver cell proliferation either under physiological conditions or during tumorigenesis.

NOX4 silencing increases the tumorigenic potential of human HCC cells in xenografts in mice, resulting in earlier onset of tumour formation and increases in tumour size.31

The loss of NOX4 increases actomyosin levels and favours an epithelial to amoeboid transition, contributing to tumour aggressiveness.38

Indeed, here we propose a new unknown, interesting and essential role for clathrin in the regulation of the crosstalk between the TGF-β and EGFR pathways.

Indeed, clathrin is necessary for the EGFR transactivation that prevents TGF-β-induced ROS production required for cell death (Fig. 6).

This hypothesis is further confirmed in the experiments of CLTC overexpression in PLC/PRF/5 cells, where we found that NOX4 expression decreases and TGF-β-induced apoptosis is inhibited in CLTC overexpressing cells (Fig. S9).

PARAGRAPH

Our results also show that the more aggressive mesenchymal-like HCC cells express higher levels of both TGFB1 and CLTC (Fig. 4).

Interestingly, after TGF-β treatment, clathrin expression is upregulated in both hepatocytes and PLC/PRF/5 cells, the effect being much more pronounced in the liver tumour cells, where upregulation is observed at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 4).

We have recently described that mesenchymal cells overexpress TGF-β, which have acquired mechanisms to escape from its suppressor effects and respond to it undergoing EMT, which facilitates migration and invasion.32

Here we hypothesized that the high levels of clathrin could be responsible for the lack of pro-apoptotic response to TGF-β in these mesenchymal-like cells.

Results support this hypothesis, since targeting CLTC knockdown in SNU449 cells, a mesenchymal HCC cell line that is unresponsive to the pro-apoptotic effects of TGF-β, sensitize them to cell death (Fig. 5).

PARAGRAPH

From these results, we decided to further improve the analysis in our cohort of patients with HCC, finding that CLTC expression positively correlates with TGFB1 expression (Fig. 7), suggesting that clathrin levels would be high when their signalling pathways are activated.

Interestingly, clathrin seems to be overexpressed in the tumour’s border.

TGF-β, expressed by stromal cells, could activate the expression of clathrin in tumoural cells enhancing its pro-tumorigenic effects and favouring the mesenchymal phenotype, migration/invasion, which would contribute to tumour expansion and/or dissemination.

Analysis in public databases allowed us to demonstrate that expression of CLTC by itself has no prognostic value for overall survival in patients with HCC, but the combination of high TGFB1 and CLTC expression clearly decreased overall survival compared to high expression of TGFB1 alone.

PARAGRAPH

In summary, we describe a novel role for clathrin in liver tumourigenesis, wherein it mediates EGFR signalling and favours non-canonical anti-apoptotic TGF-β pathways.

CLTC expression is increased in a large percentage of patients with HCC and high expression of CLTC worsens the overall survival in patients with high expression of TGFB1 (Fig. 8).

Targeting the TGF-β pathway has been proposed as a new promising therapeutic tool in HCC.39

However, the identification of new biomarkers that indicate when TGF-β is acting as pro-tumourigenic is essential to help in the selection of those patients most likely to benefit from therapy aimed at inhibiting its pathway.

Our results indicate that high expression of TGF-β concomitant with high levels of clathrin would identify those patients with HCC who are likely to benefit from TGF-β targeted therapies.

Moreover, targeting clathrin would potentiate the suppressor actions of TGF-β in HCC.
