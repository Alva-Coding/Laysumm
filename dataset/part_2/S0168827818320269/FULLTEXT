TITLE

Low subcutaneous adiposity associates with higher mortality in female patients with cirrhosis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Differences in body composition between the sexes exist in healthy subjects,1,2 and populations with cancer3 and cirrhosis,4–6 with females having higher adipose tissue mass (adiposity) and males having greater muscularity.

Body composition of people with cirrhosis has been assessed using approaches such as air displacement plethysmography, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.4,7

However, the ability of these techniques to differentiate between two major body compartments, muscle and adipose tissue, as well as their capability to provide a specific measure of adipose tissue depots (i.e., visceral, subcutaneous) is limited.

Moreover, their accuracy might also be affected by changes in fluid homeostasis, which is a frequent complication in cirrhosis.7

Computed tomography (CT) image analysis has emerged as a specific and precise method for body composition assessment, that enables quantification of muscle and different adipose tissue depots.8

In the clinical setting, CT is frequently requested for patients with cirrhosis as part of liver transplantation (LT) assessment, in order to pre-operatively map the vascular and biliary anatomy and screen for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

PARAGRAPH

Low body mass index (BMI) has been associated with increased mortality in patients with cirrhosis.9,10

Considering variability in body composition within each BMI category,11 BMI cannot be applied as an appropriate indicator of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, the two main body composition compartments, both of which exhibit divergent characteristics and functions.

PARAGRAPH

Sarcopenia, defined as low muscle mass, has emerged as an independent predictor of mortality in patients with cirrhosis.5,6,12,13

Sarcopenia is associated with elevated mortality on the LT waiting list6 and longer hospital stays following LT.14 There is a clear sex predisposition for sarcopenia in cirrhosis, being more prevalent in males than female patients.4,6,14

In studies of the association between body composition and outcomes in cirrhosis the study participants are primarily male, potentially masking the effects of females, and making it imperative that the association between body composition and mortality is examined by sex.

PARAGRAPH

While there is consensus that sarcopenia is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with cirrhosis, the prognostic significance of adipose tissue in patients with cirrhosis is not clear.

Whole-body adiposity consists of two depots (visceral and subcutaneous)15 that behave independently of one another; warranting the need to investigate cirrhosis mortality based on visceral and subcutaneous adiposity rather than total adiposity.

We aimed to explore the prognostic significance of three major body composition compartments, skeletal muscle, visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue, in patients with cirrhosis assessed for LT, according to sex.

Materials and methods

SECTION

Study population

PARAGRAPH

The Institutional Review Board of the University of Alberta has reviewed and approved this study.

Adult (≥18 years) patients with cirrhosis who had a CT image taken as part of LT evaluation at the University of Alberta Hospital between January 2000 and May 2014 were initially included (n = 927).

Patients were excluded from the study if they did not have cirrhosis, were re-transplanted or had multiple organ transplantation (n = 249), leaving 677 patients with cirrhosis.

Clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients were collected from Alberta Liver Transplant database within one week of the CT.

SECTION

CT image analysis

PARAGRAPH

Body composition was assessed using secondary analysis of abdominal CT scans taken at the 3rd lumbar vertebra (L3), as part of the LT evaluation.

L3 has been selected as a consistent landmark, as muscle and adipose tissue areas taken from a single CT image at L3, have the best correlation with whole-body muscle (R2 = 0.855, p <0.01) and adipose tissue mass (R2 = 0.927, p <0.001).

Visceral adipose tissue cross-sectional areas at L3 strongly correlate with whole-body visceral adipose tissue volume8,16 and consequently, subcutaneous adipose tissue measured at this site is representative.

Two sequential transverse CT images extended from L3 towards the iliac crest were analyzed using Slice-O-Matic software (V4.2; Tomovision, Montreal, QC, Canada; Supplementary CTAT Table).

The cross-sectional area for each tissue was calculated using standard Hounsfield Unit (HU) thresholds of −29 to 150 HU for skeletal muscle, −150 to −50 HU for visceral adipose tissue17 and −190 to −30 HU for subcutaneous adipose tissue.18

Using these HUs, adipose tissue within the abdominal wall is quantified as visceral adipose tissue.

Subcutaneous adipose tissue cross-sectional area was estimated as the area between the skin line and outer abdominal wall by a trained operator skilled in anatomy.

PARAGRAPH

By applying these HU thresholds, muscle and adipose tissue assessment of patients with cirrhosis are not biased by the presence of ascites.

The given tissue pixels were summed, multiplied by the pixel surface areas and subsequently, tissue cross-sectional areas (cm2) were calculated and averaged for two consecutive images to estimate mean tissue areas.

For adipose tissue, visceral and subcutaneous cross-sectional areas were summed to estimate total adipose tissue area.

Three body composition areas (cm2), each divided by the square of the height in meters (m2), were reported as indexes in cm2/m2, i.e., visceral adipose tissue index (VATI), subcutaneous adipose tissue index (SATI), and skeletal muscle index (SMI).

Sarcopenia was defined using established cut-offs in patients with cirrhosis awaiting LT as SMI <39 cm2/m2 in females and <50 cm2/m2 in males.6

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Continuous variables are presented as mean and standard deviation and AN independent t test was used to compare differences in means.

For categorical variables, descriptive statistics are presented as frequency and percentages and the comparison between study groups was conducted using Pearson χ2 test.

Correlation between SATI and BMI was determined by Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) analysis.

The primary outcome of the study was mortality, and patients were censored at the time of LT or the last visit.

Significant predictors of mortality in patients evaluated for LT were determined using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models and the results were reported as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs.

Features known to associate with mortality of patients with cirrhosis including age, cirrhosis etiology, serum albumin and sodium, diabetes, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, refractory ascites, hepatic encephalopathy as well as body composition variables including SMI, SATI and VATI were included in univariate analysis.12,14

Mortality risk is frequently underestimated by the MELD score in patients with refractory ascites, so subgroup analysis was conducted in male and female patients with refractory ascites to investigate the prognostic value of anthropometric markers.

Variables with p <0.10 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate model.

The most parsimonious model was selected as the final model.

PARAGRAPH

First, we assessed the HRs of SMI, VATI, SATI for mortality, as dimensional variables.

Following this, we determined optimal cut-off values to predict mortality, just for the significant dimensional body composition variables.

SATI as a dimensional body composition variable did not associate with mortality in male patients, therefore, cut-offs were established for SATI to predict mortality, using a receiver-operating characteristic analysis, only in female patients.

Model capability to distinguish between outcome groups was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC).

The value with the highest Youden’s Index (sensitivity + specificity − 1) was considered as the optimal cut-off.

Using a Cox proportional hazard model, a MELD-SATI score (inclusion of SATI within MELD score) was developed for mortality prediction:MELD-SATI=MELD+(beta[SATI]/beta[MELD])*SATI=MELD+(-0.157)*SATIThe discriminative ability of the model was assessed using the concordance statistic (c-statistics).

PARAGRAPH

Overall survival estimates were obtained using Kaplan-Meier curves and comparisons between low and high SATI was conducted using the log-rank test.

The median overall survival time for our patient population was not reached, hence the six-month, one-year, two-year and five-year survival probabilities were reported.

PARAGRAPH

In patients listed for LT, the main outcome is waitlist mortality described as death prior to LT or delisting for clinical deterioration.

However, in these patients, death and LT are two competing events as LT incidence impedes the primary outcome occurrence and the risk of long-term mortality may be diminished by LT. Cox proportional hazard models assume that competing events are absent (censored) and so, they may overestimate the risk.

The Fine and Gray competing risks approach assesses the association between variables and outcome in the presence of competing events.

Therefore, competing-risk analysis is a more robust approach, compared to the conventional survival analysis, in the presence of competing events.19

Association between sarcopenia and elevated mortality risk is well established in male patients with cirrhosis, either evaluated5 or listed6 for LT. Therefore, as the next step, competing-risk analysis was conducted using Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model only in the listed female patients.

Results

SECTION

Baseline characteristics of patients

PARAGRAPH

Patient characteristics at the time of CT are presented (Table 1).

The majority were male (67%) with a mean age of 57 ± 7 years, and MELD score of 14 ± 8.

Mean BMI was 27 ± 6 kg/m2 with the majority (62%) of patients being overweight or obese (BMI ≥25).

The primary reason for cirrhosis was hepatitis C virus (HCV, 40%), alcohol (23%), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, 23%), autoimmune liver disease (8%), and hepatitis B (6%).

Concomitant HCC was present in 43% of evaluated patients.

The mean MELD score in evaluated male and female patients without HCC was 17 ± 9 and 16 ± 8, respectively.

Sixty-eight percent (n = 463) of evaluated patients were listed for LT, of which 66% were males.

Mean MELD score was 15 ± 8 in both male and female listed patients.

In listed patients without HCC, mean MELD of 18 ± 8 and 16 ± 9 was observed in male and female patients.

Refractory ascites (25%), hepatic encephalopathy (18%) and HCC (59%) were the main indications for LT in listed patients with an MELD ≤15.

PARAGRAPH

Evaluated patients (listed and non-listed) were followed for a mean time of 21 ± 30 months, until death (n = 258), LT (n = 248) or censoring (n = 171) (Fig. 1).

Of 258 patients who died, 54 patients (21%) died from liver failure, 69 (27%) from sepsis, 42 (16%) from HCC, 18 (7%) from hepatorenal syndrome, 9 patients (3%) from variceal bleeding, and 66 patients (26%) from other causes.

PARAGRAPH

In listed patients, mean follow-up time was 20 ± 29 months and waitlist death occurred in 27% of the listed patients (n = 125) due to sepsis (33%), liver failure (26%), HCC (16%), hepatorenal syndrome (7%), variceal bleeding (4%), and other causes (14%).

PARAGRAPH

Of 463 listed patients, 215 patients did not undergo LT because of medical improvement, malignancy, death prior to LT, cardiac problems, or active substance abuse (Fig. 1).

SECTION

Body composition analysis

PARAGRAPH

Despite similar BMI between male and female patients, body composition differed, with male patients having greater SMI (53 ± 12 vs. 45 ± 9 cm2/m2) and VATI (39 ± 30 vs. 31 ± 22 cm2/m2) whereas SATI (67 ± 52 vs. 48 ± 37 cm2/m2) was higher in females (p <0.001 for each [Table 1]).

Fifty-two out of 221 (24%) female patients had sarcopenia, while of 456 male patients, sarcopenia was observed in 190 patients (42%; p <0.001).

SATI was lower (52 ± 43 vs.77 ± 55 cm2/m2; p <0.001) in female patients who died whereas SMI (51 ± 12 vs. 54 ± 12 cm2/m2; p = 0.04) was lower in deceased male patients.

Considering body composition differences between male and female patients, subsequent survival analysis was conducted separately for male and female patients.

SECTION

Features associated with mortality in female patients

PARAGRAPH

To evaluate the association between body composition and mortality, Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed.

By univariate Cox analysis, age, alcohol-related cirrhosis, albumin, MELD, and SATI were predictors of mortality in females (Table 2).

There was no association between SMI or VATI and mortality in females.

SATI independently associated with mortality (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.98–1.00; p = 0.01), after adjusting for other survival predictors (Table 2).

In female patients with refractory ascites, SATI (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.98–1.00; p = 0.01) was independently associated with mortality after adjusting for MELD.

Inclusion of SATI within the MELD score (MELD-SATI) showed an excellent discriminative performance for predicting three-month mortality (c-index 0.93).

Moreover, MELD-SATI exceeded the discriminative performance of the MELD score for the prediction of overall, 6-, and 12-month mortality (Table 3).

PARAGRAPH

In females, SATI less than 60 cm2/m2 was found to be independently associated with mortality, with AUC of 0.64 (95% CI 0.56–0.71; p <0.001).

Female patients with SATI <60 cm2/m2 had a higher risk of mortality (HR 2.06; 95% CI 1.08–3.91; p = 0.03 [Table 4]) compared to the patients with high SATI.

The six-month, one-year, two-year and five-year probabilities of survival were 71%, 64%, 52% and 36% in patients with low SATI, compared to 84%, 78%, 70% and 61% in females with high SATI, respectively (Fig. 2).

SECTION

Characteristics of female patients with low SATI

PARAGRAPH

The correlation between SATI and BMI in female patients was moderate (r = 0.53, p <0.001 [Fig. 3]).

Female patients with low SATI had a lower BMI and higher prevalence of sarcopenia.

However, low SATI presented in patients across all BMI categories and 41% of patients with low SATI exhibited normal BMI (20.0 to 24.9 kg/m2).

No significant difference was observed between low and high SATI patients regarding age, and MELD score.

HCV cirrhosis was more prevalent in patients with high SATI; alcohol induced cirrhosis tended to be higher in patients with low SATI.

No other significant difference in the etiology of cirrhosis was observed between patients with low and high SATI (Table 5).

SECTION

Body composition and mortality in male patients

PARAGRAPH

In order to investigate the association between body composition and mortality in male patients, multivariate analysis was performed including the same variables presented for females (Table 2).

In males, HCV cirrhosis, NASH cirrhosis, albumin, MELD, refractory ascites, serum sodium and SMI were factors associated with mortality on univariate analysis.

On multivariate model including confounding clinical variables and dimensional body composition variables (Table 2), SMI (HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96–1.00; p = 0.02) independently associated with mortality risk.

In male patients with refractory ascites, SMI (HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96–1.00; p = 0.02) was independently associated with mortality after adjusting for MELD and serum sodium.

PARAGRAPH

The same pattern was observed when SMI was included as a dichotomous variable in the model (HR 1.79; 95% CI 1.22–2.63; p = 0.003 [Table 4]).

Neither VATI nor SATI were associated with mortality in male patients.

SECTION

Competitive risk analysis in female patients

PARAGRAPH

The association between sarcopenia and elevated mortality risk is well established in male patients with cirrhosis, either evaluated5 or listed6 for LT. Therefore, subsequent competitive risk analysis of the association between SATI and mortality was performed solely in female patients listed for LT (n = 158).

Considering LT as the competing event, in the multivariate risk analysis, SATI (sHR 0.99; 95% CI 0.98–1.00, p = 0.01) independently associated with higher risk of mortality (Table 6).

By treating SATI as a dichotomous variable, low SATI (SATI <60 cm2/m2) was an independent predictor of elevated mortality (HR 2.80; 95% CI 1.28–6.12; p = 0.01) after adjusting for MELD, albumin, alcohol-cirrhosis, refractory ascites and hepatic encephalopathy (Table 6).

SECTION

Cause of death in female cirrhosis patients by SATI stratification

PARAGRAPH

Fifty-seven out of 87 deceased female patients had low SATI compared to 30 patients with high SATI (p = 0.004).

The frequency of sepsis (33 vs. 17%; p = 0.004) and liver failure-related mortality (28 vs. 13%; p = 0.007) was significantly higher in patients with low SATI compared to the patients with high SATI.

There were no significant differences in the frequency of HCC (7 vs. 0%, p = 0.29), hepatorenal syndrome (7 vs. 10%, p = 0.71), variceal bleeding (4 vs. 13%, p = 0.41) and other causes of death (21 vs. 47%, p = 0.70), among female patients with low and high SATI.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this study, we described body composition differences by sex in patients with liver cirrhosis and assess their association with survival.

In general, male patients had more muscle and visceral adipose tissue but a higher proportion were sarcopenic, whereas subcutaneous adiposity was predominant in females.

CT image-based analysis of two major body compartments, muscle and adipose tissue, revealed that lower SATI associates with higher mortality in female patients.

Similar findings have been reported for the association between SATI and mortality in patients with gastrointestinal, respiratory, prostate and renal cancers3,20 as well as in patients with hematological malignancies.21,22

Meanwhile, SMI predicts mortality in male patients with cirrhosis.

This emphasizes the necessity for further studies to investigate potential interactions between SMI and SATI on mortality.

PARAGRAPH

The prevalence of sarcopenia in cirrhosis has been reported to be between 22 to 70% according to CT studies,23 with a higher prevalence in male patients.4,5

The association between sarcopenia and higher mortality risk in cirrhosis has been observed in studies where the majority of study participants were male.5,14

Accordingly, the higher proportions of male patients in those studies could be driving the association between sarcopenia and mortality.

By sex stratification, sarcopenia increased mortality risk mainly in male patients, but this association has not been consistent in female patients with cirrhosis,24 which is in keeping with our current findings.

Besides body composition, sex differences exist regarding other clinical features of liver disease such as etiology, presence of liver tumors25 and creatinine levels,26 illustrating the importance of sex classification in cirrhosis associated mortality studies.

PARAGRAPH

The survival benefit of higher BMI has been observed in patients with malignancies, during critical illness, sepsis events, and after trauma or major surgical procedures; this has been termed the “obesity paradox”.27

Higher BMI is also associated with lower mortality in cirrhosis;10,28 however, assessment of BMI or total adipose tissue cross-sectional area does not necessarily reflect SATI.

Two female patients with similar BMI (23 kg/m2) but different SATI are highlighted (Fig. 4A and B).

Variability in SATI among patients with similar total adipose tissue is exemplified by two female patients of the identical total adipose tissue index (133 cm2/m2) (Fig. 4C and D).

PARAGRAPH

Subcutaneous adipose tissue is more metabolically favorable than visceral adipose,29 as patients with higher subcutaneous adipose tissue have lower glucose and lipid levels.

Subcutaneous adipose tissue is the major producer of leptin,30,31 the hormone that regulates insulin sensitivity, glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as immune response.32–34

Patients with lipodystrophic loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue have an increased risk of insulin resistance, diabetes, and dyslipidemia.35

Diminished lipid storage capacity of subcutaneous adipose tissue, evidenced by lower fat cell weight, in overweight and obese postmenopausal women was associated with metabolic syndrome and potentially ectopic fat accumulation.36

In experimental models, transplantation of subcutaneous adipose tissue into visceral adipose leads to improved glucose metabolism and reduction in body weight and total adipose tissue, while transplantation of visceral into subcutaneous adipose tissue does not achieve these metabolic improvements.32

PARAGRAPH

The explanation for the association between SATI and female mortality in cirrhosis has not been identified.

One of the main functions of subcutaneous adipose tissue is energy storage.

It is possible that the low volume of subcutaneous adipose tissue mirrors the severe energy exhaustion triggered by cirrhosis, leading to worse clinical outcomes.

Lower serum leptin levels in hospitalized patients with decompensated cirrhosis have been described as an indicator of malnutrition and fat depletion.37

Fat loss in female, malnourished hospitalized patients with cirrhosis38 independently associated with survival.39

This implies that low SATI in female patients in this study might be an indicator of poor nutritional status.

Moreover, estrogen has been shown to influence regional fat distribution by favoring fat expansion in subcutaneous over visceral depots in females.40

Estrogen replacement therapy has been associated with prolonged survival in patients with HCC.41

These beneficial effects of subcutaneous adipose tissue demonstrate the necessity to evaluate cirrhosis mortality based on visceral and subcutaneous adiposity rather than total adiposity or BMI.

PARAGRAPH

In the present study, we evaluated mortality risk by Cox regression and competitive risk analysis with LT as the competitive event.

Previous studies showed that applying conventional survival analysis could produce bias in the presence of the competing event.19

Therefore, to overcome this obstacle, subanalysis for competing risks, including SATI as both a dimensional and dichotomous variable was conducted and the association between SATI and mortality remained significant in female patients.

The only two different variables between Cox proportional hazard model and the Fine and Gray competing risks model (in terms of significance) were refractory ascites and hepatic encephalopathy.

This may be because these two factors are independant indications for LT. The Cox model (where LT is censored) failed to show an association between these two factors and mortality, whereas the Fine and Gray model did show the association.

PARAGRAPH

The findings of our study emphasize the importance of differentiating between muscle, subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, by using cross-sectional imaging in patients with liver cirrhosis.

There are significant limitations to the use of anthropometric tools in this population because, among other factors, the presence of fluid overload can mask malnutrition.42

Body composition assessment by CT image analysis in patients with cirrhosis is a major strength of this study.

PARAGRAPH

We acknowledge there are limitations in this study, as we were unable to evaluate metabolic characteristics such as serum leptin, estrogen levels, insulin resistance and inflammatory markers in patients because of the retrospective nature of the study.

We were also unable to assess muscle function (e.g. handgrip strength) which in some studies has been associated with mortality, even in female patients.43

We agree that cut-offs established in this study may not be generalized to other regions and populations, however, to our knowledge; this study is the largest body composition analysis in the North America with 677 patients showing an association between fat distribution and survival.

Larger prospective studies in patients with cirrhosis are required to validate established cut-offs.

Moreover, a larger population of female patients with cirrhosis is required to determine various interactions between sarcopenia and subcutaneous adiposity given the lower prevalence of sarcopenia in female patients with cirrhosis.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, low SATI is associated with higher mortality in female patients with cirrhosis, whereas low SMI predicts mortality in male patients.

Subcutaneous adipose tissue plays an important role in energy storage; low SATI may reflect the severe energy exhaustion caused by cirrhosis, leading to the poor clinical outcomes.

Our results support the need for further studies to investigate potential interactions between muscle and subcutaneous adipose indexes on mortality.
