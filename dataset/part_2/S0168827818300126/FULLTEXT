TITLE

Irradiation stents vs. conventional metal stents for unresectable malignant biliary obstruction: A multicenter trial

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Malignant biliary obstruction (MBO) is a common condition caused by biliary tract cancer (cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder carcinoma, or ampulla carcinoma), pancreatic cancer, or metastatic lymph nodes.1

The incidence of MBO is modest in the Western world, although consistently rise; while in East and Southeast Asia, the incidence is remarkably high and poses significant public health issues.2

Surgical excision of detectable tumor is associated with improvemed survival.1

However, less than 20% of patients are surgical candidates once obstructive jaundice has occurred,3 and the long-term survival remains dismal.4,5

For unresectable tumors, stenting is considered the preferred palliative modality to relieve pruritus, cholangitis, pain, and jaundice, with or without chemotherapy.3,6

Meanwhile, conventional self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) has a high incidence of restenosis which limits the survival benefit.

Despite many advances in stent design over the past decade, none of them was acknowledged as a substitute for conventional SEMS.7

An irradiation biliary stent loaded with iodine 125 (125I) seeds has been demonstrated to offer significantly longer survival in patients with unresectable MBO when compared to an uncovered SEMS in a single-center randomized trial.8

This phase III trial aimed to further assess the efficacy of this irradiation stent in those patients.

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Study design and participants

PARAGRAPH

This multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase III trial was designed to compare the irradiation stent with the uncovered SEMS for unresectable MBO at 20 centers in China.

The study was approved by the ethics committee of each center.

Each patient gave written informed consent prior to enrollment.

The inclusion criteria were: i) aged 18–90; ii) clinically or histopathologically confirmed MBO; iii) with symptoms related to MBO (jaundice, pruritus, cholangitis, or pain); iv) Bismuth-Corlette type I or II MBO based on the magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and/or enhanced computed tomography (CT) images; v) unresectability because of extensive lesions, metastases, poor medical condition, or refusal to be surgically treated; vi) with clear consciousness, cooperation, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, 2 or 3.

PARAGRAPH

Exclusion criteria were: i) benign biliary obstruction; ii) ECOG performance status of 4; iii) a history of biliary stenting or bile tract surgery; iv) active hepatitis; v) Bismuth-Corlette type III or IV MBO; vi) uncooperative patients or those who could not provide authorization and signature.

Prior percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) was not an exclusion criterion for enrollment.

Chemotherapy was performed according to the patient’s condition and with patient approval, but external beam radiotherapy was not performed in this trial.

SECTION

Randomization

PARAGRAPH

The study statistician computer-generated stratified block randomization sequences with a block size of eight before recruitment, using the software of SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

Randomization was performed centrally after admission by staff members in the trial office.

After providing consent, the screened patients were consecutively assigned to either of the two groups.

Patients in the irradiation stent group (ISG) received the placement of an irradiation stent, while those in the uncovered SEMS group (USG) received an uncovered SEMS.

Staff members had no further role in the trial.

No blinding was performed.

SECTION

Change in the protocol

PARAGRAPH

We originally intended to recruit participants with unresectable MBO caused by cholangiocarcinoma.

The original sample size calculated was 238.

However, we had to revise our target because of the slow participant recruitment process.

The condition was expanded from unresectable MBO caused by cholangiocarcinoma to various malignancies, and the recalculated sample size was 328.

Power re-estimation was based on the results of this study and formula proposed by Tai et al.9 For interesting events, we assumed a cause-specific hazard ratio of 0.446 and a subdistribution hazard ratio of 0.573 (Table 2), if allocating 1:1, at an α-level of 0.05, with 328 patients, 90 interesting events would result in 97% and 75% statistical power, respectively.

Therefore, with the proportional subdistribution hazard model, 328 patients satisfied the desired power of 80%.

PARAGRAPH

The statistical method was changed at the end of the trial because of the high frequency of death before patients reached the primary outcome.

Usually, death is considered a noninformative censoring event for Kaplan-Meier estimation.

However, if death occurred before restenosis the patency would be affected in this study.

Therefore, this assumption regarding death was invalid.

Consequently, a competing risk method and subdistribution hazard model were used to evaluate the effect of stent type on stent patency.

Meanwhile, a subdistribution hazard model was used to report on the incidence rate.

SECTION

Intervention

PARAGRAPH

The irradiation stent consists of two overlapped parts to minimize the delivery sheath: an inner conventional uncovered SEMS and an outer 125I seed-loaded stent, which are assembled in the biliary tract (Fig. S1).

The diameter and length of the stents were determined by the measurement of the lesions based on MRCP and/or enhanced CT images.

The 125I seeds (CIAE-6711; Chinese Atomic Energy Science Institution, Beijing, China) were pre-loaded into the sheaths, which were attached to the outer surface of the stent immediately before the procedure.

The number, dosage, and distribution of 125I seeds were calculated according to the Treatment Planning System (TPS, FTT Technology Ltd.

Co., Beijing, China).

PARAGRAPH

Stent implantation was performed by the physicians who had been trained in adequate stent placement technique before the trial started.

In the ISG, a percutaneous intrahepatic biliary tract puncture was performed under fluoroscopy with or without ultrasound guidance.

Following coaxial dilatation with a balloon dilator catheter, an outer 125I seed-loaded stent was introduced into a 10 French sheath, which was then deployed into the diseased bile duct over a stiff guidewire.

After that, an inner uncovered SEMS (Nanjing Micro-Tech Co. Ltd., Nanjing, China) was immediately implanted to overlap the outer 125I seed-loaded stent.

In the USG, an uncovered SEMS (Nanjing Micro-Tech Co. Ltd., Nanjing, China) was implanted into the diseased bile duct following the coaxial dilatation.

PARAGRAPH

Radiation safety and management, with regard to the irradiation stents, were carried out according to the criteria recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP).10

Routine follow-up (blood biochemistry, performance status, clinical signs, and imaging) was performed one week after stent placement, then monthly for six months, and then every three months after that.

SECTION

Study endpoints

PARAGRAPH

The primary endpoint was stent patency, which was calculated from the date of stent placement to the first episode of stent restenosis.

The definition of stent restenosis was defined as patients presenting with clinical signs of recurrent jaundice with elevated bilirubin levels along with biliary dilation on CT, MRCP, ultrasound, or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography.

Cumulative restenosis rate was used to report patency in the subdistribution hazard model.

PARAGRAPH

The secondary endpoints included technical success, relief of jaundice, overall survival, and complications.

The technical success was defined as the ability to deploy the stent in the target position of the bile duct with full expansion in both groups, and complete overlap between the inner and outer stents without seed migration in the ISG.

Relief of jaundice was defined as reduction of more than 20% total bilirubin within one week of stent implantation.6

The overall survival was defined as the time from stenting to death or the last follow-up.

Complications were evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 4.02).

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

The previous studies demonstrated that in patients with unresectable MBO, the median stent patency of stent placement combined with brachytherapy was approximately 7.4 to 9.8 months, while that of uncovered SEMS was approximately 5.4 to 6.7 months.8,11–13

Hence, we estimated the median stent patency to be 9.5 months in the ISG vs. 6.5 months in the USG, and we projected an enrollment period of 18 months, an entire trial period of 24 months, a two-sided α-level test of 0.05 and 80% power, resulting in a minimum sample size of 312.

Considering the cases of dropping out (5%), we estimated the sample size to be 328.

Sample size estimation was conducted using the PASS11 software (NCSS, LLC., Kaysville, Utah, USA).

PARAGRAPH

Intent-to-treat analyses included all patients who were enrolled in the study and received randomization.

Per-protocol analyses included patients who successfully received the assigned stents implanted in the target biliary tract.

The variables were expressed as numbers (percentages) or as medians with interquartile range (IQR).

Baseline characteristics, complications, and cause of death were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Pearson Chi-Square/Fisher’s exact tests.

Restenosis was analyzed by both Cox regression on the cause-specific hazard ratio (CSHR) and Fine-Gray regression on sub-distributional hazard ratio (SHR) to show the direct and indirect effects of stent types on stent restenosis.14

The Fine-Gray model was built to model the cumulative incidence of restenosis, considering death a competing event.

Censored cases were defined as event-free at the time of study completion or loss to follow-up during the study time.

Overall survival was analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method.

PARAGRAPH

Univariate analysis was performed by Fine-Gray and Cox models to identify risk factors for stent restenosis and overall survival separately.

Backward model selection was conducted in Cox regression with criteria of staying in model 0.10 to identify independent risk factors for overall survival.

Proportionality assumptions in Fine-Gray and Cox models were tested by including covariate time interaction terms.

Two sets of point-based risk scores, which represent the risk of restenosis and death were generated from the Fine-Gray model and Cox model, respectively.

Risk scores of death were calculated based on multivariate Cox model for overall survival analysis.

The risk scores of restenosis were calculated based on the Fine-Gray model.

Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated from two sets of risk scores.

Two-sided tests were performed and p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.

All statistical analyses were performed using STATA 14 (College Station, TX: Stata Corp LP).

Results

SECTION

Patient characteristics

PARAGRAPH

A total of 328 patients out of 375 candidates were enrolled from 20 centers between October 2013 and March 2016 (Fig. 1).

After randomization 152 patients in the ISG vs. 155 patients in the USG successfully received the assigned stents, while 21 patients did not successfully receive the assigned stent.

Baseline characteristics showed that the two groups were well balanced (Table 1).

SECTION

Primary endpoint

PARAGRAPH

Stent restenosis was observed in 21% (34/164) of patients in the ISG and 34% (56/164) in the USG, respectively.

Median patency time in the USG was 294 days, while that in the ISG was not obtained because of the unexpected low rate of stent restenosis.

The first quartile stent patency time (when 25% of the patients experienced stent restenosis) was 212 days for the ISG and 104 days for the USG.

Patients in the ISG were significantly associated with a decrease in the rate of restenosis (CSHR 0.479; 95% CI 0.312–0.737).

This result was in line with the result displayed by the Fine-Gray model analyses (SHR 0.573; 95% CI 0.375–0.876) (Table 2 and Fig. 2A).

The stent restenosis rates at 90 days, 180 days, and 360 days in the ISG and USG were 9% vs. 15%, 16% vs. 27%, and 21% vs. 33%, respectively (p = 0.010; Fig. 2B).

PARAGRAPH

Re-intervention was performed in 34 of these 90 patients (13 in the ISG vs. 21 in the USG) who experienced stent restenosis.

Twelve patients (seven in the ISG vs. five in the USG) underwent additional uncovered SEMS implantation (Nanjing Micro-Tech Co. Ltd., Nanjing, China) and 22 patients (6 in the ISG vs. 16 in the USG) underwent PTBD (Ultrathane® Multipurpose Biliary Drainage Catheter, Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA).

Whereas in the other 56 patients (21 in the ISG vs. 35 in the USG), re-intervention was not attempted because of the poor systemic conditions, limited life expectance after re-intervention, patients’ refusal, or other reasons.

SECTION

Secondary endpoints

PARAGRAPH

One stent per patient was successfully implanted in 307 patients.

Technical success was achieved in 93% (152/164) of patients in the ISG and 95% (155/164) of patients in the USG (p = 0.499).

No radioactive seed-related technical failures were encountered.

The median activity of 125I seeds used in the ISG was 10.8 millicuries (mCi; range, 5.6 to 16.0).

The median calculated surface radiation dose at the dose prescription point (coaxial circumference outside the stent, 15 mm distance to the central axis of stent) was 47.0 gray (Gy; range, 29.9 to 61.3).

PARAGRAPH

Relief of jaundice within one week after stent placement was recorded in 85% (139/164) of patients in the ISG vs. 80% (132/164) in the USG (p = 0.308).

Other symptoms associated with MBO, such as pruritus, cholangitis, pain, etc., were relieved to various degrees after stent implantation.

PARAGRAPH

During the median follow-up period of 167 days (IQR 78 to 277 days), 54 (16%) patients were alive but 274 (84%) patients died.

The causes of death included MODS (55%), cancer cachexia (19%), severe infection (10%), hemobilia (7%), among others (Table S1).

The median survival was significantly longer in the ISG than that in the USG (202 days; 95% CI 171–232 vs. 140 days; 95% CI 117–163; p = 0.020; Fig. 3).

Tumor extent, chemotherapy, stent type, age, tumor etiology, and ECOG were independent risk factors of survival in the multivariate regression analysis (Table S2).

The correlation coefficient in the two sets of risk scores showed that a higher risk of restenosis is correlated with higher risk of death (r = 0.397; r = 0.644 drop with one outlier; p <0.001; Fig. S2).

Subgroup analyses were performed by tumor etiology and ECOG.

In the subgroup analyses of pancreatic carcinoma and lymph node metastases, the differences of overall survival between two groups were not significant (p >0.05; Fig. S3); while in the subgroup of biliary tract cancer, the difference was significant (p = 0.035; Fig. S3).

In the subgroup analyses by ECOG scores (from 0–3), the HRs from Cox model were smaller than one across all ECOG scores, although the differences were not significant (p >0.05; Fig. S4).

PARAGRAPH

There was no device- or procedure-related mortality in this study.

The overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 complications was comparable (8.5% vs. 7.9%; p = 0.841).

Cholangitis was the most common complication, occurring in 2.4% of patients in the ISG vs. 3.0% of patients in the USG (Table 3).

PARAGRAPH

We performed per-protocol analyses that included 307 patients who successfully received the assigned stent.

Relief of jaundice within one week after stent placement was recorded in 86% (130/152) of patients in the ISG vs. 81% (125/155) of patients in the USG (p = 0.254).

The other results of these analyses were largely similar to the results of the intention-to-treat analyses (Table S3–6 and Fig. S5–7).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

This trial demonstrates that inserting an irradiation biliary stent significantly decreases the stent restenosis rate and subsequently prolongs the stent patency, as well as improving overall survival when compared to an uncovered SEMS in patients with unresectable MBO.

PARAGRAPH

Decompression of MBO is a well-established treatment strategy, with similar patency and procedure-related complication rates by endoscopic approach or percutaneous approach in centers that perform a high volume of PTBD.15–17

SEMS are widely used in MBO with longer patency when compared with plastic stents.

However, tumor ingrowth through the mesh or overgrowth over both ends of the stent has been the main limitation of uncovered SEMS.18

To prolong the stent patency, many other techniques such as intraluminal radiofrequency ablation, photodynamic therapy, brachytherapy, and paclitaxel-drug eluting stent have been applied to MBO.19

In the field of brachytherapy, 125I seeds implantation has been certified as a standard treatment with acceptable toxicity in prostatic cancer, and its use in the treatment of many other solid tumors has rapidly increased.10

Intraluminal brachytherapy with strands of 125I seeds has been applied to the treatment of MBO and portal vein tumor thrombosis with promising results.20,21

Based on these techniques, an irradiation stent loaded with 125I seeds was developed for esophageal cancer, and its technical feasibility, safety, and outcomes have been investigated.22–24

Modified from the irradiation esophageal stent, a 125I seed-loaded biliary stent was then developed to immediately relieve the obstruction, and potentially inhibit tumor ingrowth with well-distributed radioactive seeds.

A single-center randomized controlled phase II trial with 24 patients showed significantly longer median survival after placement with the irradiation stent.8

This phase III trial was designed and conducted to further assess the efficacy of such an irradiation biliary stent in prolonging stent patency and patient survival.

PARAGRAPH

Although a covered stent has the advantage of removability, it failed to exhibit consistent conclusions in terms of stent patency when compared to uncovered SEMS in several meta-analyses.25,26

The reported restenosis rate of SEMS in MBO was up to 50% within six to eight months.27

In this trial, the restenosis rate in the ISG was 21%, significantly lower than the rate of 34% in the USG, but the irradiation stent yielded limited advantage when compared to the data (22%) obtained in a recent systemic review.28

That might be attributed to the different approaches of stent placement, as well as different baseline characteristics of included patients.

Nevertheless, the stent type was the only risk factor for stent restenosis in a competing risk regression model, suggesting that the irradiation stent prolongs the stent patency when compared to an uncovered SEMS.

PARAGRAPH

In the present study, the median survival in the ISG was longer than that in the USG.

The advantage was in accordance with the previous phase II trial.8

Risk of restenosis was correlated with risk of death and stent type was found to be an independent risk factor for survival, which suggested that placement of an irradiation stent prolonged the survival of patients with MBO.

Interestingly, the results of subgroup analyses by tumor etiology demonstrated that the difference between the two groups was only significant for biliary tract cancer, not pancreatic carcinoma and lymph node metastases, indicating that patients with biliary tract cancers benefit most from irradiation stent placement.

This phenomenon may be explained by brachytherapy providing better tumor control for localized malignant obstruction derived from biliary tract, than for metastases from other organs.

In the subgroup analyses based on ECOG status, although no significance was achieved because of inadequate sample size after stratification, there was a trend favoring ISG (HR <1), which suggested that all patients in the ISG still obtained benefits in term of overall survival.

PARAGRAPH

Chemotherapy was regarded as a preferred choice after successful biliary drainage for patients with MBO.29

In the present study, better survival was obtained in patients who received chemotherapy.

However, only a small number of patients received chemotherapy because of poor status and patient refusal during follow-up.

In addition, tumor extent, age, tumor etiology, and ECOG were also co-risk factors for overall survival.

These findings were in accord with previous studies.30–33

PARAGRAPH

Two non-controlled cohort studies in inoperable patients with MBO treated using a combination of intraluminal brachytherapy (HDR-192Ir-ILBT) and metallic stent implantation reported acceptable safety and promising results.34,35

Theoretically, the four lines of radioactive seeds used by the new device in this study should improve dosimetry compared to brachytherapy, with a tube shaking in the biliary tract, described in previous reports.

The estimated median radiation dose in this study at the dose reference points calculated by the computerized TPS was approximately 47.0 Gy, which is between the reported dose of 25.0 to 70.0 Gy in traditional brachytherapy with other radioactive sources.36,37

None of brachytherapy-related grade 3 or 4 complications was found in this trial.

The incidences of possible grade 3 or 4 complications between the two groups were comparable.6,38

These results indicated that the dosimetry of 125I and placement of the irradiation stent were well-tolerated.

PARAGRAPH

The study has several limitations.

Firstly, the imbalance between groups in each center was caused by the lack of stratified randomization.

Secondly, the competing risk analyses failed to be employed in ECOG 0 because of the small sample size, especially no restenosis occurred in the ISG.

Therefore, we have to merge the ECOG 0 and 1 for univariate and multivariate regression analysis.

Thirdly, the rate of histopathological diagnosis of MBO was relatively low.

However, considering the suboptimal sensitivity of histopathological diagnosis, high incidence of MBO in East and Southeast Asia, and the clinical progress during follow-up until death, clinical diagnosis was also allowed in this study.39,40

Fourthly, all stents were placed via percutaneous access.

The feasibility of endoscopic placement warrants further investigation.

Finally, the exact efficacy of chemotherapy for prolonging survival in this study could not be clarified.

SECTION

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, placement of an irradiation stent provides longer patency and subsequently improves the overall survival compared with a conventional uncovered SEMS in patients with unresectable MBO.
