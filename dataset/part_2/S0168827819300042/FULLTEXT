TITLE

Estimation of renal function in patients with liver cirrhosis: Impact of muscle mass and sex

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Accurate evaluation of renal function is a prerequisite for the management of patients with liver cirrhosis.1

It facilitates diagnostic and therapeutic assessment, prognostic evaluation and indication for liver transplantation.2

It is well known that cirrhosis is often accompanied by decreased renal function, resulting in poor outcomes even in stage I acute kidney injury (AKI).3,4

PARAGRAPH

Creatinine (Cr), the most frequently used parameter for the evaluation of renal function, is a very powerful prognostic biomarker in cirrhotic patients, and an important element of the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scoring system.5

However, renal function estimated by the Cr-based formula is relatively inaccurate considering endogenous synthesis and metabolism.2

The actual renal function is likely to be overestimated rather than undervalued, especially in patients with liver cirrhosis because of poor nutritional status and reduced muscle mass.6

Since Cr is produced in liver and stored in muscle following phosphorylation, its serum concentration is inevitably associated with liver function and muscle mass.

It is also known to be affected by age, gender, and race, which are reflected in Cr-based formulas.7,8

In fact, it has been reported that Cr-based equations (e.g. MDRD-4 equation) overestimate the true renal function by less than 30% to as much as 50%, especially, in patients with poor liver function or low glomerular filtration rate (GFR).9–11

PARAGRAPH

However, few studies correlated the true GFR with potential markers in large series of cirrhotic patients.

In this study, we investigated the extent of overestimation of 2 common estimated GFR (eGFR) calculations using Cr and cystatin C, compared with measured GFR (mGFR) using 51Cr-EDTA, and identified the impact of low muscle mass on over/underestimation of renal function.

Patients and study protocol

PARAGRAPH

Between January 2007 and December 2016, we collected data from consecutive cirrhotic patients obtained during routine clinical care in a tertiary hospital, in South Korea.

Patients who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria were eligible for the study: i) clinically, pathologically, or radiologically diagnosed with liver cirrhosis; ii) those tested for serum Cr, serum cystatin C, 51Cr-EDTA on the same day; iii) those who underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans within 3 months before and after blood test.

Patients with AKI were included in the study after complete improvement of AKI to avoid contrast induced nephropathy.

Patients were excluded if: i) they were undergoing regular hemodialysis due to end-stage renal disease; ii) they were already diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or who were suspected of having CKD in lab test or clinical history; iii) they had malignancy including liver cancer; or iv) if the patient had overt hypothyroidism or overt hyperthyroidism that can affect the cystatin C value.

Finally, we retrospectively reviewed 779 patients who met the inclusion criteria.

In these patients, we compared the 3 different methods of renal function measurement: (a) Modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD)-eGFR (using serum Cr); (b) cystatin C-eGFR (using serum cystatin C); and (c) 51Cr-EDTA-mGFR.

Clinical and laboratory records of all patients were retrospectively reviewed.

PARAGRAPH

The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital (IRB No 2017-11-013).

eGFR

PARAGRAPH

Six variable-MDRD (MDRD-6)-eGFR was calculated with equations based on serum Cr as described below:7

PARAGRAPH

186 × (serum Cr [mg/dl])−1.154 × (age)−0.203 × (0.742 if patient is female) × (1.21 in black patients);

PARAGRAPH

Cystatin C-eGFR was calculated with chronic kidney disease-epidemiology collaboration cystatin C equations based on serum cystatin C as described below:12

if serum cystatin C is equal or below 0.8 mg/L,

133 × (serum cystatin/0.8)−0.499 × 0.996 Age (×0.932 if female)

if serum cystatin C is over 0.8 mg/L,

133 × (serum cystatin/0.8)−1.328 × 0.996Age (×0.932 if female)

SECTION

mGFR

PARAGRAPH

Before the test, we recorded the height and weight of each patient, and diluted 80 μCi of 51Cr-EDTA with 8 ml of normal saline.

The sum of the syringe weight + 51Cr-EDTA solution + IV amount was defined as W1.

We transferred 1 ml of W1 to a 199 ml beaker with a syringe and used it as a standard solution.

The butterfly needle was connected to the syringe containing 10 ml of normal saline to determine the IV passage and fix it.

The 51Cr-EDTA syringe was connected and injected vertically to inject the full amount of 51Cr-EDTA in the syringe.

The catheter was flushed with 10 ml normal saline.

The blood samples were drawn sharply at 3 h and 5 h after injection.

The plasma disappearance curve was constructed using the results of these 2 time points.

Plasma clearance rate and mGFR by 51Cr-EDTA were calculated as described below:E1=θ∫Pdt=Q×λCE1=Wi×S×dilutationvolumestandardWs×In(C1/C2)δt×C2(t1/dt)C1(t2/dt)

SECTION

Assessment of muscle mass

PARAGRAPH

Muscularity was assessed using a method reported previously.13

A transverse CT image at the level of L3 was assessed from each patient.

Images were analyzed with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Image J program, which enables specific tissue demarcation using previously reported Hounsfield unit (HU) thresholds.

Skeletal muscle was identified and quantified using HU thresholds of −29 to +150.

Muscles in the L3 region encompass psoas, erector spinae, quadratus lumborum, transversus abdominis, external and internal obliques, and rectus abdominis.

The following HU thresholds were used for adipose tissues: −190 to −30 for subcutaneous and intermuscular adipose tissue, and −150 to −50 for visceral adipose tissue.

Using these specific HU thresholds, measurements of the skeletal muscle index were not influenced by the presence of ascites, overweight, or obesity in patients with cirrhosis.

Cross-sectional areas (cm2) were automatically computed by summing the tissue’s pixels and multiplying by pixel surface area.

All CT images were analyzed by a single trained radiologist.

The cross-sectional area of muscle and adipose tissue was normalized for stature (cm2/m2) as reported before,14,15 and this value was referred to as the L3 skeletal muscle index (L3 SMI).

SECTION

Definitions

PARAGRAPH

Overestimation was defined as more than 20% increment of mGFR estimated by a Cr-based formula with reference to existing literature.16

PARAGRAPH

The definition of AKI was followed by the International Club of Ascites (ICA) criteria.17

AKI was defined in patients with cirrhosis by: i) an increase in serum Cr greater than 0.3 mg/dl within 48 h, or ii) a greater than 50% increase in serum Cr from baseline, which is known, or presumed, to have occurred within the past 7 days.

SECTION

Competing risk analysis

PARAGRAPH

The major competing outcome for the enrolled patients was liver transplantation.

If liver transplantation occurs, hazards for each type of event (overall survival [OS], AKI, hepatorenal syndrome [HRS]) cannot be calculated correctly.

To overcome this limitation, we conducted competing risk analysis regarding liver transplantation for the prediction of prognosis.

We defined 2 mutually exclusive events, that is, competing risks: liver transplantation and others (OS or AKI or HRS).

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Frequencies and percentages were used for descriptive statistics.

Statistical differences between the groups were investigated using the χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test for the categorical variables and Student’s t test or Mann-Whitney U test for the continuous variables.

To evaluate the predictive accuracy of eGFRs, the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for censored data and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were constructed according to Heagerty et al.18 A larger AUC at a given time point corresponds to a better predictability of time to event.

The primary endpoint of this study was the risk factors contributing to overestimation of eGFR in cirrhotic patients.

Therefore, logistic regression analysis was the primary tool used.

We included the muscle mass value in the multivariable model, regardless of the p value of the univariate, in order to evaluate the effect of muscle mass on GFR.

The final result was obtained after backward elimination based on the Akaike information criteria.

All statistical analyses were performed using R (version 3.3.3, The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and statistical significance was defined as a p <0.05.

Results

SECTION

Baseline characteristics

PARAGRAPH

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are listed in Table 1.

A total of 779 cirrhotic patients were analyzed.

The median observation period was 44.6 months (interquartile range [IQR], 10.7–81.0 months).

About three-quarters of all patients were male (75.4%), and one-quarter were female (24.6%).

The most common cause of cirrhosis was alcoholism (48.4%), followed by viral hepatitis (41.6%), and other factors (10%).

The mean cross-sectional muscle mass at the level of the third lumbar vertebrae (L3), defined as L3 muscle index (L3 MI), was 10.78 × 103 mm2.

Of all patients, 24.5% were graded as Child-Pugh class A, 58.7% as Child-Pugh class B, and 16.8% as Child-Pugh class C.

A total of 55.1% of the patients presented with ascites.

SECTION

Correlation and comparison of MDRD-eGFR and cystatin c-eGFR with51Cr-EDTA-mGFR

PARAGRAPH

The mean value of 51Cr-EDTA-mGFR was 79.24 ml/min/1.73 m2 (range, 9.94–155.77) (Table S1).

Compared with MDRD-eGFR and cystatin C-eGFR, it was distributed in a relatively narrow range (Fig. S1).

Correlation between 51Cr-EDTA-mGFR and cystatin C-eGFR was moderately better than between 51Cr-EDTA-mGFR and MDRD-eGFR (r = 0.56 vs. 0.46) (Table S2).

The correlation between mGFR and cystatin C-eGFR was still higher than that of mGFR and MDRD-eGFR when patients were separated into 3 groups according to the degree of mGFR (mGFR ≤50, 50< mGFR ≤100, mGFR >100).

The same results were obtained in a Bland-Altman plot when 51Cr-EDTA-mGFR was used as the gold standard (Fig. S2).

SECTION

Overestimation of renal function by MDRD-eGFR and its risk factors

PARAGRAPH

Next, we reviewed patients whose renal function was overestimated compared with mGFR, and the factors influencing the overestimation.

As described earlier, overestimation was defined by values of MDRD-eGFR, which were 20% higher than those of 51Cr-EDTA-mGFR.

Using this definition, the renal function of 455 out of 779 patients (58.4%) was classified as an overestimation (cross mark in Fig. 1).

The overestimated group comprised a larger proportion of females, decreased muscle mass, and a higher baseline Cr value (Table 1).

Multivariate analysis showed that female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.91; 95% CI 3.09–7.79; p < 0.001), decreased L3 MI (aOR 0.89; 95% CI 0.83–0.90; p = 0.001), and liver function deterioration (Child-Pugh class B vs. A: aOR 1.69; 95% CI 1.17–2.46; p = 0.006.

Child-Pugh class C vs. A: aOR 1.84; 95% CI 1.13–2.98; p = 0.014) were independent predictors of overestimation after adjustment for age (Table 2).

SECTION

Differential effects of muscle mass on overestimation of renal function depending upon sex

PARAGRAPH

The muscle mass, in terms of L3 MI in this study, showed no statistically significant difference between the overestimated and non-overestimated groups.

However, it was a significant risk factor after adjustment for other variables.

Although muscle mass was an independent risk factor for overestimation, our results showed that females had significantly lower L3 MI and that their renal function was more frequently overestimated than in males, suggesting that sex was an important effect modifier (Table S3).

Muscle mass distribution in different populations according to overestimation is shown in Fig. 2.

Considering this interaction, we performed multivariate analysis separately by sex (Table 3).

In males, decreased muscle mass strongly affected the overestimation (aOR 0.87; 95% CI 0.80–0.93; p <0.001); however, it did not affect females (aOR 1.02; 95% CI 0.83–1.25; p = 0.862).

Next, we analyze the risk of eGFR overestimation according to the amount of muscle mass (Fig. 3).

In the case of males, the risk of overestimation was markedly increased with lower muscle mass and decreased with higher muscle mass.

However, this correlation was not observed in females.

SECTION

Comparison of MDRD-eGFR and cystatin C-eGFR for predicting prognosis

PARAGRAPH

Since Cr is used in the MELD scoring system, we compared the prognostic ability of Cr- and cystatin C-based eGFR.

During the observation period (median 44.6 months; IQR, 10.7–81.0 months), 407 patients (52.2%) died, and 22 patients (2.8%) underwent liver transplantation.

We identified the cause of death in 202 patients based on their medical records.

Liver failure (104, 51.5%) was the most common cause of death, followed by hepatocellular carcinoma (31, 15.3%), bleeding (23, 11.4%), and infection (22, 10.9%).

Cystatin C or mGFR was superior to Cr in predicting the OS during all the periods of observation (Fig. 4), and the result was similar in competing risk analysis (Fig. S3).

Cystatin C showed a higher AUC than Cr at 5 years (0.62 vs. 0.56, p <0.001) as well as 1 year (0.62 vs. 0.56, p <0.001).

PARAGRAPH

During the follow-up, AKI developed in 319 patients (40.9%) according to ICA-AKI criteria, and HRS developed in 182 patients.

Baseline cystatin C had a high predictive power for both AKI and HRS as well as survival rate.

The higher AUC value of the cystatin C-based equation compared to the Cr-based equation both at 1 year (0.71 vs. 0.65, p <0.001) and 5 years (0.68 vs. 0.64, p = 0.004) predicted the cumulative incidence of AKI (Fig. S4A).

However, in HRS, the predictive power of cystatin C was superior only at 1 year (0.69 vs. 0.65, p = 0.040), but not at 5 years (0.66 vs. 0.62, p = 0.099) (Fig. S4B).

Overall, cystatin C-based eGFR showed a superior performance to Cr-based eGFR for the prediction of survival and renal complications.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Cr is the most commonly used renal biomarker representing GFR.

However, as shown in this study, measurement of renal function using Cr and Cr-based eGFR yielded an apparently higher value than the actual GFR levels in a significant number of cirrhotic patients.

Furthermore, Cr is an incomplete parameter for the measurement of renal function in these patients for the following reasons: (a) reduced hepatic production; (b) edematous state such as ascites and peripheral edema; and (c) associated muscle wasting.19

Therefore, even in AKI, the normal range of Cr is often observed in clinical practice.

In addition, the most commonly used Cr-based eGFR measurements using C-G formula and MDRD equations were originally conducted in healthy men and CKD populations, respectively, suggesting that the accuracy of GFR in a specific patient group such as cirrhosis is compromised.7,8

Previous studies investigating the validity of eGFR reported frequent and significant discrepancies in mGFR of cirrhotic patients, consistent with our study.16

Furthermore, Cr-based eGFR was poorly predictive of in-hospital mortality in cirrhosis, which was also consistent with our findings.20

PARAGRAPH

The main factors affecting overestimation of GFR in our study were skeletal muscle mass, gender, and liver function.

Sarcopenia has recently attracted much attention as a prognostic factor in cirrhotic patients.21

Our results confirmed that renal function may appear good when muscle mass is decreased.

In fact, lean body mass has been directly related to GFR in previous studies, and sarcopenia increased the risk of renal deterioration, represented by aspartate aminotransferase/height2.22

Although the mechanism is unclear, high muscle mass has a renal protective role in patients with CKD.23

It is plausible that sarcopenia may exacerbate renal dysfunction directly and thus have adverse effects on survival in cirrhotic patients.

Interestingly, in our study, decreased muscle mass was not associated with overestimation of GFR in females, rather it greatly influenced renal function in males.

These results suggest that serum Cr concentrations in women may be controlled by different mechanisms compared to those in men.

We think that different patterns of loss of gonadal function may explain this finding.

Testosterone is the most well-known sex hormone that can affect sarcopenia.24

In men, testosterone is relatively reduced in older people, but women have less testosterone reduction with aging than men.

Women have decreased estrogen after menopause, but unlike testosterone, estrogens are not thought to have anabolic effects on skeletal muscle.25

In some reports, anti-estrogen therapy administered in premenopausal women with breast cancer or uterine cancer was associated with progression of sarcopenia, but this effect was offset in women aged 65 years and older.26–28

In addition, inflammation plays an important role in the development of sarcopenia, and adipose tissue is an important source of pro-inflammatory cytokines.29

The proportion of fat is higher in women than men, suggesting that regional adiposity and gender difference could influence the risk of sarcopenia.

Taken together, our findings suggest that the effect of muscle mass should be applied to the eGFR equation for the accurate evaluation of renal function, especially in male cirrhotic patients.

PARAGRAPH

Next, female gender also affected overestimation.

Women have a relatively low level of serum Cr even when mGFR is considerably depressed, and are therefore likely to underscore in the MELD scoring system.30

After switching to the MELD scoring system, the proportion of male transplant recipients increased, and women had a significantly higher mortality rate than men while waiting for a liver transplant.31,32

Women reported higher scores when Cr was replaced with mGFR in the MELD scoring system.33

We also found that female patients were more likely to manifest overestimated renal function than male patients.

PARAGRAPH

Due to the limitations of Cr for clinical application as described above, we studied cystatin C as an alternative to Cr several years ago, and we found that cystatin C was a useful marker for the estimation of GFR in cirrhotic patients.

Cystatin C was more closely associated with mGFR than Cr, and superior in predicting prognosis.34

Cystatin C, unlike Cr, is not affected by other factors except renal function and predicted renal dysfunction earlier in previous studies.35,36

In this study, Cr-based eGFR was shown to exaggerate actual GFR in over 40% of patients compared with cystatin C-based eGFR.

In addition, cystatin C was superior to Cr in predicting OS, probably via earlier detection of renal dysfunction than Cr.

Cystatin C is also associated with liver fibrosis, but this has yet to be clearly established.37,38

PARAGRAPH

Our study limitations are as follows.

First, instead of inulin, 51Cr-EDTA was used as a gold standard.

However, 51Cr-EDTA showed high accuracy compared with inulin and is relatively inexpensive and simple compared with other methods of mGFR estimation.39

Second, even though we consecutively enrolled the patients, selection bias is inevitable in a retrospective analysis, and therefore, our results cannot be applied to all cirrhotic patients.

Ascertainment or measurement bias may have occurred even though the radiologist who measured muscle mass was blinded to the medical information of each patient.

Finally, we did not monitor the dynamic variation of Cr or cystatin C, which would be a more important factor for estimation of the risk of AKI development or survival.

PARAGRAPH

In summary, renal function overestimation occurs frequently in patients with liver cirrhosis, and greater attention is required, especially if patients are female, have reduced skeletal muscle mass, or advanced liver disease.

Cystatin C was more closely correlated with mGFR, with a higher predictive ability compared to Cr for renal complications and survival.

Therefore, cystatin C rather than Cr represents a potentially new prognostic marker in patients with cirrhosis.

Of note, our results based on accurate measurement of GFR and muscle mass provide supporting evidence that sarcopenia has a great impact on overestimation of kidney function in male patients with cirrhosis.

Exclusion of muscle mass in patients with cirrhosis may lead to discrepancies in renal function measurements and clinical outcomes.

Nevertheless, our results need to be confirmed in a larger prospective cohort of patients with cirrhosis.
