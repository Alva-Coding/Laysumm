TITLE

Estimation of renal function in patients with liver cirrhosis: Impact of muscle mass and sex

PARAGRAPH

Overestimation of renal function frequently occurs in patients with liver cirrhosis when using serum creatinine.

Decreased muscle mass has a great impact on overestimation of kidney function especially in male patients with cirrhosis.

Compared with creatinine, cystatin C was more closely correlated with measured glomerular filtration rate and had a higher predictive ability for renal complications and survival than creatinine.
