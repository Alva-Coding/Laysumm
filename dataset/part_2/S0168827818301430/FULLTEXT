TITLE

Hepatitis D virus replication is sensed by MDA5 and induces IFN-β/λ responses in hepatocytes

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Among the 240 million hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected people worldwide,1 15–25 million are coinfected with hepatitis D virus (HDV) (WHO fact sheet, July 2016), a satellite virus which requires HBV envelope proteins for particle assembly and spread.

HBV/HDV coinfection leads to the most severe form of viral hepatitis with an accelerated progression to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.2

Therapeutic options for chronically HBV/HDV coinfected patients are still limited to IFN-α therapy for eligible patients, however, this therapy is not curative in the vast majority of patients.3,4

HDV consists of a single-stranded circular 1.7 kb RNA genome of negative polarity and represents the smallest mammalian virus genome identified to date.5

HDV RNA replication takes place in the nucleus of hepatocytes through a double rolling circle mechanism, producing antigenomic RNA, genomic RNA and mRNAs encoding the small and large hepatitis delta antigens (S- and L-HDAg).

The circular genomic HDV RNA is highly self-complementary (∼74% base pairing) and therefore forms rod-shaped viroid-like tertiary structures.6

During assembly, the newly synthesized genomic RNA associates with HDAg molecules to form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex.7

These RNPs become enveloped by budding into the ER lumen at HBV envelope protein (L-/M- and S-HBsAg) assembly sites, which are provided by either covalently closed circular DNA of HBV coinfected hepatocytes or possibly integrated HBV sequences.8

PARAGRAPH

The cellular innate immune system constitutes the first line of defense against microbial infections and plays a crucial role in inhibition and clearance of invading pathogens.9

The innate immune response is also crucial for mounting robust adaptive immune response (reviewed in10,11) and thereby determine the outcome of infection, i.e. clearance or persistence, with the latter often associated with chronic inflammation.12

Innate immune responses are initiated by the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as viral genomes or replication intermediates like double-stranded RNA (dsRNA).

Thereby, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) i.e. toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), the retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I [DDX58])-like receptors (RLRs) including RIG-I and the melanoma differentiation antigen 5 (MDA5 [IFIH1]) (reviewed in13,14) sense the PAMPs and initiate a cascade of signaling events that lead to the production of type I (IFN-α/β) and type III interferons (IFN-λ).

These are secreted and bind their cognate IFN-receptors on the membrane of infected and non-infected neighboring cells, activating hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) that counteract viral infections by diverse mechanisms.15

PARAGRAPH

Preceding studies suggest that HDV induces IFN-β and IFN-λ in differentiated HepaRG cells16 and various mouse models.17–19

However, it remains unclear: i) which PRR(s) are sensing HDV, ii) which IFNs are specifically induced and iii) how a possible induction of IFNs and the resulting antiviral state of cells influences HDV replication.

Herein, we took advantage of different in vitro infection systems to identify the PRR sensing HDV and the types of IFNs induced by the virus.

Moreover, we determined the impact of the IFN-induced antiviral state on HDV replication.

Results

SECTION

HDV infection activates the IFN system in HepG2NTCP and HepaRG cells

PARAGRAPH

To investigate the cellular response towards HDV and HBV infection, in depth, we performed whole transcriptome analysis of infected, innate immune competent HepG2NTCP cells.

Myrcludex B served as entry inhibitor control to rule out effects mediated by contaminants in the virus inoculum.

Further, we used HuH7NTCP cells, which support HDV infection but are deficient in IFN production.27,28

Infection efficiency was verified by immunofluorescence (IF) staining of HDAg or HBcAg (Fig. 1A) and total RNA was subjected to microarray analysis at day nine post infection.

Compared to uninfected and MyrB-inhibited HepG2NTCP cells, 426 genes were upregulated >2-fold by HDV (Fig. 1B, left column).

Remarkably, HBV infection of the same cell line did not result in any significant (>2-fold) induction of gene expression (Fig. 1B, right column).

Pathway clustering analysis revealed that the IFN signaling pathway was the most significant upregulated pathway (Fig. S1) with the 15 most upregulated (>10-fold) genes being ISGs (Fig. 1C).

Notably, MyrB treatment blocked ISG activation (Fig. 1C), indicating that productive HDV infection rather than the inoculum itself is required.

Results from the microarray assay were validated for selected ISGs including IFI27, IFI44, ISG15, MX1 and RSAD2 by RT-qPCR (Fig. 1D).

PARAGRAPH

To determine the kinetics of HDV-mediated activation of the IFN system in a more authentic cell culture system, differentiated HepaRG cells expressing only endogenous NTCP were used.

After differentiation, cells were inoculated with HDV in the absence or presence of MyrB.

HDAg and Mx1 expression were analyzed by IF at the indicated time points.

As depicted in Fig. 1E (upper panels), HDAg (red) could be detected from day two post infection onwards.

Mx1 expression (green) was detectable from day three post infection, and rapidly spread throughout the cell culture.

Both HDAg expression and Mx1 induction could be inhibited by MyrB indicating that Mx1-induction requires HDV replication and is not caused by the inoculum per se.

SECTION

HDV activates IFN-ß and IFN-λ in HepG2NTCP, HepaRGNTCP cells and PHH

PARAGRAPH

To identify the pattern of IFNs induced upon HDV infection, HepG2NTCP, HepaRGNTCP cells and PHH were infected with HDV at 0.5 IU/cell in the absence and presence of MyrB.

Infection efficacy and successful block of virus entry was controlled by IF of HDAg at day five post infection (Fig. 2A, left panels).

Intracellular HDV RNA replication was quantified by RT-qPCR at day one, three, five and seven post infection (Fig. 2A, right panels).

Replicative intermediates were detectable in all cell lines from day three on (Fig. 2A, right panels).

Further, mRNAs of IFNα, -β, -λ1 and -λ2/3 at the same time points were quantified by RT-qPCR.

As shown in Fig. 2B, activation of IFNβ and IFNλs, but not IFNα was measurable from day three on, peaking at day five to seven.

MyrB completely blocked IFN activation.

(Fig. 2B).

Importantly, ectopic expression of S-HDAg and L-HDAg in HepG2NTCP by transfected plasmids or inoculation with UV inactivated HDV did not induce IFNs (Fig. S2).

This indicates that IFN-β and –λ activation is triggered neither by incoming viral RNP complexes nor by HDAgs, but requires active replication of HDV RNA.

PARAGRAPH

To test whether HDV-induced IFNs show antiviral activity, we applied the supernatants of HDV-infected HepG2NTCPand HepaRGNTCP cells to an HCV luciferase replicon-based reporter system.

As shown (Fig. 2C), cell culture supernatants (day 5–7) from HDV infected HepG2NTCPand HepaRGNTCP cells significantly inhibited HCV replication.

SECTION

MDA5 is the key PRR sensing HDV

PARAGRAPH

To determine PRR(s) possibly involved in HDV sensing we first evaluated the functionality of the key sensors RIG-I, MDA5 and TLR3 in HepG2NTCP- and HepaRGNTCP cell lines by treatment with PRR-specific stimuli: SeV (stimulation of RIG-I), a mutant of the Mengo-Zn virus29 (stimulation of MDA5) or incubated the cells with poly(I:C) (activation of TLR3).

Quantification of the induced IFNs showed that both HepG2NTCP and HepaRGNTCP cell lines are competent in RIG-I and MDA5 activation, while only HepaRGNTCP cells are competent in TLR3 signaling (Fig. S3A).

PARAGRAPH

We next generated HepG2NTCP and HepaRGNTCP cell lines stably expressing RIG-I, MDA5 or TLR3-specific shRNAs resulting in the knock-down of the respective PRR.

Quantification of the mRNAs in both cell lines demonstrated efficient suppression of each receptor (Fig. 3A, left panels).

For RIG-I and MDA5, this could be verified at the protein level (Fig. 3A, right panels), while TLR3 could not be detected in western blot.

Knock-down was further confirmed by using a functional assay demonstrating a loss of IFN-λ1 induction by SeV and Mengo-Zn virus infection as well as poly(I:C) treatment (Fig. S3B).

Taking advantage of these cell lines, we quantified HDV replication and activation of the IFN response upon HDV infection.

As depicted (Fig. 3B and C), infection efficacy was comparable in all six PRR knock-down cell lines, as shown by HDAg-specific IF performed at day five post infection, and resembled that of the control cell lines expressing a non-targeting shRNA (right panels).

Consistently, intracellular HDV RNA replication was comparable between all different cell lines (Fig. 3B and C, left panels).

Notably, activation of IFN-β, -λ1 and the ISG RSAD2 was almost completely blocked in the MDA5-deficient cell lines whereas knock-down of RIG-I and TLR3 had no effect on IFN activation (Fig. 3D).

Similar blockade of IFN response by depletion of MDA5, but not RIG-I and TLR3, was observed using alternative shRNAs for each PRR (Fig. S4) ruling out possible off-target effects.

This provides compelling evidence that MDA5 is the key PRR for HDV in HepG2NTCP and HepaRGNTCP cells.

SECTION

Overexpression of MDA5 promotes HDV-induced IFN response in HuH7.5NTCP cells

PARAGRAPH

HuH7.5 cells are deficient in sensing through RLRs and TLRs.30

However, HuH7.5 cells can promote RLR signaling27,28,31 upon ectopic expression of these PRRs making these cells a preferred tool to investigate RLR-mediated responses.

Consistently, we observed a very weak induction of IFN-λ1 in HuH7.5NTCP cells upon infection with SeV or Mengo-Zn virus or after treatment with poly(I:C) (Fig. 4B).

Yet, stable expression of RIG-I, MDA5 or TLR3 (Fig. 4A) resulted in a profound enhancement of IFN-λ induction by SeV and Mengo-Zn virus infection (Fig. 4B).

Though, poly(I:C) mediated stimulation of the TLR3 pathway still did not induce an IFN response, arguing for an additional downstream defect (Fig. 4B).

PARAGRAPH

We finally infected HuH7.5NTCP cells stably expressing RIG-I, MDA5 or TLR3 with HDV.

IF staining of HDAg and quantification of total intracellular HDV RNA revealed comparable infection efficiencies in all cell lines (Fig. 4C and D).

Although the HDV-induced IFN response was generally low, we observed a significant activation of RSAD2 and IFI44 upon HDV infection in the MDA5 overexpressing cells, but not in cells overexpressing RIG-I (Fig. 4E).

This provides additional evidence for MDA5 being the sensor of HDV RNA.

SECTION

IFN activation during long-term HDV infection of HepG2NTCP and HepaRGNTCP cells

PARAGRAPH

HDV coinfection in chronic HBV-infected patients typically manifests as a persistent infection, depending on enduring replication and intrahepatic spread of HDV replicative RNA intermediates.

To find out if the induced IFN response interferes with enduring HDV replication or vice versa, we performed long-term cell culture infection experiments in HepG2NTCP and HepaRGNTCP cells.

We infected both cell lines with HDV and analyzed HDAg expression by IF (Fig. 5A), L- and S-HDAg by western blot (Fig. 5B) and intracellular HDV RNA by RT-qPCR (Fig. 5C) throughout a 23 day infection period.

HDAg expression and HDV RNA replication in HepG2NTCP cells peaked at day 11 post infection and remained at such levels until day 23 (Fig. 5A, B and C, upper panels).

In contrast, HDAg expression and HDV RNA replication in the more authentic HepaRGNTCP cell line dropped profoundly after day five post infection and were almost undetectable at day 23 (Fig. 5A, B and C, lower panels).

These data indicate a marked difference in the persistence of HDV RNA replication in HepG2NTCP vs. the HepaRGNTCP cell line.

In parallel, we quantified activation of IFN-α, -β, -λ1, -λ2/3 and RSAD2.

Consistent with the results depicted in Fig. 2B, HepG2NTCP cells (Fig. 5D, upper row) and HepaRGNTCP cells (Fig. 5D, lower row) showed a strong increase of all IFN and ISG mRNAs except IFNα at five days post infection.

However, at later points IFN and ISG mRNA levels decreased significantly in both cell lines (Fig. 5D).

Despite this drop, the intracellular HDV RNA level remained unchanged until day 23 in HepG2NTCP cells, while it significantly dropped in HepaRGNTCP cells (Fig. 5C).

Again, MyrB abrogated all signals, verifying the requirement for active replication.

This result suggests that although HDV RNA triggers an IFN response, this response declines at later time points of infection.

SECTION

Effect of MDA5 depletion on HDV replication

PARAGRAPH

To investigate whether the MDA5-mediated, HDV-induced IFN-response inhibits HDV replication during long-term cell culture infection, we determined HDV replication markers (HDV RNA and HDAg) in HepG2NTCP and HepaRGNTCP cell lines harboring a stable knock-down of MDA5 (shMDA5) and compared them to the parental cells expressing a non-targeting control shRNA (shNT).

HDAg expression (Fig. 6A and B) and intracellular HDV RNA was quantified until day 23 post infection (Fig. 6C).

We found that HDAg expression and HDV RNA increased from day 1–11 post infection and remained at high levels until day 23 in both HepG2NTCP derived cell lines.

In the two HepaRGNTCP cell lines, HDAg expression and HDV RNA decreased significantly after day seven post infection.

These data confirm previous result in HepG2NTCP and HepaRGNTCP cells (Fig. 5).

Importantly, although HDV RNA levels in HepG2NTCPshMDA5 and HepaRGNTCPshMDA5 cells were higher than in the control HepG2NTCPshNT and HepaRGNTCPshNT cells, the level of enhancement was rather weak at early points and getting moderate at late points of infection (about 7.5-fold difference between HepaRGNTCPshNT and shMDA5) (Fig. 6C).

The kinetics of IFN response (IFNλ1 and RSAD2 mRNA levels) correlated with that of HDV RNA, and the overall IFN response in shMDA5 cells was significantly lower than that in shNT cells (Fig. S5).

These results imply that HDV replication is only moderately sensitive to MDA5-mediated innate immune responses, however, the MDA5 mediated antiviral IFN response may contribute to the reduction of HDV markers during long-term cell culture infection.

SECTION

HDV replication is insensitive to IFN responses

PARAGRAPH

As HDV replication is only moderately affected by the IFNs induced during replication, we analyzed if ISG expression was dampened in HDV positive cells on the single cell level.

HDV infected HepG2NTCP-and HepaRGNTCP cells showed high levels of Mx1, comparable to HDAg negative cells (Fig. 7A).

This indicates that, at the single cell level, HDV replication is insensitive to IFN responses without blocking ISG expression.

PARAGRAPH

To test whether HDV replication is sensitive to exogenous IFN treatment, HepG2NTCP and HepaRGNTCP cells were infected with HDV, and treated with IFN-α2a (100 IU/ml) or IFN-λ1 (10 ng/ml) from day 1–7 (early treatment) or day 5–11 (late treatment) (Fig. 7B).

HDAg and HDV RNA were analyzed after IFN treatment.

Both IFN-α2a and IFN-λ1 treatments showed less than 50% inhibition of HDV replication markers during early treatment (day 1–7) and no significant effect during late treatment (day 5–11) in both HepG2NTCP and HepaRGNTCP cell lines (Fig. 7C and D), although both IFN treatments severely inhibited HCV replicon replication (Fig. 7E).

This result indicates that HDV replication is insensitive to exogenous IFN treatment after the establishment of infection in vitro.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Our study shows that (i) HDV replication, in contrast to HBV replication,32 activates IFN-β and IFN-λ in NTCP-expressing HepG2NTCP and HepaRGNTCP cell lines and in PHH, (ii) MDA5 is the key sensor for IFN activation by recognizing replicating HDV RNA intermediates, (iii) knock-down of MDA5 has little effect on HDV replication efficacy, and (iv) HDV replication is not abolished by the endogenously induced IFN response or exogenous IFN treatment.

PARAGRAPH

Type I (IFN-α/β) and type III IFNs (IFN-λ) are potent antiviral components of the cellular innate immune system.33

Although both IFNs activate a similar spectrum of ISGs, they exert distinct and non-redundant functions.34–36

Previous results have shown that IFN-β, but not IFN-α is activated by HDV infection.16–19

Further, a moderate induction of IFN-λ was observed in HDV/HBV coinfected humanized mice.17

Consistent with these reports, we found that HDV infection activates IFN-β and IFN-λ1/2/3 but not IFN-α (Fig. 2) in NTCP-expressing cell lines and PHH.

IFN-induction by HDV requires active RNA replication since UV irradiated, inactivated hepatitis D virions and ectopically expressed HDAg had no effect on IFN expression (Fig. S2).

PARAGRAPH

Through shRNA-mediated knock-down of the three key RNA PRRs RIG-I, MDA5 and TLR3, we identified MDA5 as the key sensor recognizing HDV in HepG2NTCP and HepaRGNTCP cells (Fig. 3).

MDA5 belongs to the group of RLRs and senses predominantly long dsRNA or higher ordered RNA structures37,38located in the cytosol.

However, since HDV replicates in the nucleus forming antigenomic and genomic multimeric and monomeric RNAs intermediates, these are probably not accessible to MDA5.

Thus, we assume that RNA sensing by MDA5 might occur during cytosolic export of RNPs during cytoplasmic trafficking to the site of envelopment.

Because of their self-complementarity, the rod-shaped secondary structure elements within the HDV genome may be important for efficient recognition by MDA5.

However, a detailed investigation of the crucial RNA elements recognized by MDA5 activation remains for future analysis and will allow a better molecular understanding of both MDA5 activation and HDV induced IFN response.

PARAGRAPH

After HDV superinfection of HBV mono-infected patients, HDV regularly persists in a chronic state.

Thus, in the majority of cases IFN-induction does not lead to elimination of HBV nor HDV (although HBV replication is often suppressed in HDV/HBV coinfected patients).

We therefore analyzed the HDV replication kinetics and innate immune responses during long-term cell culture infection (up to 23 days) of HepG2NTCP and HepaRGNTCP cells.

HDV RNA replication kinetics are similar at early time points (day 1–7) in both cell lines, and stay at a peak plateau in HepG2NTCP cells but decline profoundly in the more authentic HepaRGNCTP cells (Fig. 5) at later time points.

Of note, the innate immune responses significantly decreased from day seven post infection in both cell lines (Fig. 5).

The reduction of HDV RNA replication from day five post infection in HepaRGNTCP cells is probably not caused by the inhibition of the innate immune responses, since MDA5 depletion in the same cell line has little effect on HDV replication (Fig. 6).

The decline of IFN activation in the presence of continuously high level replication of HDV RNA in HepG2NTCP cells may thus be due to antagonists produced by HDV or the negative feedback of IFN signaling pathway as it has been reviewed in.39

Previous in vitro studies using transfection of HDV encoding plasmid reported an HDV-mediated inhibition of STAT1 nuclear translocation in response to IFN-α in HuH7 cells.40

Using the humanized mouse model Giersch et al. observed that STAT1 nuclear accumulation was most pronounced in human hepatocytes displaying undetectable amounts of HDAg.17

Conversely, our results show that activation of IFN-induced Mx1 protein was not reduced in HDV replicating HepG2NTCP and HepaRGNTCP cells (Fig. 7A).

This indicates that IFN signaling still occurs in HDV infected cells and favors other mechanisms that contribute to the reduction of innate immune responses at late time points.

PARAGRAPH

Depletion of MDA5 had a weak effect on HDV replication, but may contribute to HDV inhibition during long-term cell culture infection (Fig. 6).

However, since the replication of HCV is still strongly inhibited by supernatants from HDV infected HepG2NTCP and HepaRGNTCP cells (Fig. 2C), we conclude that HDV replication is essentially insensitive to MDA5-mediated IFN response.

PARAGRAPH

We confirmed this assumption by analyzing the sensitivity of HDV replication to ectopically added IFN-α and IFN-λ.

Although both IFNs strongly inhibited HCV replication (at 100 U/ml) (Fig. 7E), they exhibited only a moderate effect (<50% inhibition) on HDV replication.

Moreover, this inhibition was only observed when we treated the cells at an early stage of infection (day 1–7) but no effect after the establishment of infection (day 5–11) (Fig. 7C and D), indicating the insensitivity of HDV replication to IFNs after intracellular establishment of infection.

One previous study also showed that the inhibition of HDV replication by IFN-α and IFN-γ in PHH only occurred when the cells were exposed to these IFNs at a very early stage (<16 h) of infection.41

Of note, our study was performed using HDV mono-infection in in vitro cell culture models that do not support secondary infections (due to the absence of HBV envelope proteins).

During HBV/HDV coinfection in patients or spread-supporting models, innate immune responses may influence HDV spread.

Recently reported suppression of HDV replication by pegylated (Peg) IFN-α and IFN-λ in HBV/HDV coinfected humanized mice42 and clinical observations of HDV inhibition by IFNs in some patients might be due to an inhibition of viral spread rather than to a direct effect on replication in persistently infected hepatocytes.

These findings may also explain the clinical observations of low response rate following IFN therapy and HDV RNA relapse in chronic HDV infected patients (reviewed in43).

PARAGRAPH

Taken together, we demonstrate that HDV activates IFN-β and IFN-λ responses, through activation of MDA5 by unknown replicative intermediate structure(s) of HDV RNA.

Intracellular HDV replication is mostly insensitive to the MDA5 mediated innate immune response and, similar to HBV,44 not directly affected by exogenous IFNs after the establishment of infection.

These findings contribute to a better understanding of the interaction between HDV and the innate immune system, helping to explain the limited efficacy of current IFN therapies.
