TITLE

ARRB1 inhibits non-alcoholic steatohepatitis progression by promoting GDF15 maturation

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with the progressive dysfunction of lipid metabolism and a consequent inflammatory response.

Decreased ARRB1 is observed in patients with NASH and murine NASH models.

Re-expression of Arrb1 in the murine NASH model ameliorated liver disease, an effect which was more pronounced in the presence of pro-GDF15 overexpression, highlighting a promising strategy for NASH therapy.
