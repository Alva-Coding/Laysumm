TITLE

Impaired cerebral microcirculation induced by ammonium chloride in rats is due to cortical adenosine release

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Ammonium has repeatedly been found to be a key factor in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE)1 and development of brain oedema in acute liver failure.2

Yet, the underlying mechanisms are still not understood in detail; specifically, a mediator responsible for disturbances in the microcirculation and vasodilation remains to be identified.

PARAGRAPH

An associated complication of HE/brain oedema in severe cases of liver failure is the loss of autoregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF)3,4 and an impairment of the otherwise tight coupling between flow and metabolism.

This leaves the brain very susceptible to variations in the perfusion pressure, and interferes with the basic function of the neurovascular unit.

For example, brief episodes of systemic hypotension can lead to ischaemic damage to the brain, and intermittent hypertension can result in severe hyperperfusion and risk of vasogenic oedema.

Indeed, haemodynamic instability is a common complication of the failing liver, both acute liver failure5 and acute-on-chronic liver failure,6 and even with management in an intensive care unit, keeping the systemic blood pressure stable can be a difficult task.

PARAGRAPH

Although the pathophysiology behind this dysregulation of CBF is not apparent, substantial scientific attention has been paid to the subject to disentangle the mechanisms involved.4,7,8

The concomitant presence of systemic inflammation and loss of functional liver mass seems to be an important factor associated with impairment of the ability to preserve microcirculatory flow on the surface of rat brain during exsanguination.9

Since adenosine appears to be released extracellularly in vitro and in vivo after exposure to ammonium10 and is a vasoactive molecule involved in endogenous regulation of flow in the neurovascular unit,11 we decided to study the effect of ammonium on the cerebral microcirculation with focus on the role of adenosine.

We hypothesized that ammonium exposure would lead to impaired flow preservation in brain cortex of rats and an impaired myogenic response to arterial hypotension due to release and accumulation of adenosine in the extracellular space close to cerebral microvessels.

To study the effect of endogenously released adenosine, we used the adenosine receptor antagonist ZM 241385, selectively antagonizing the adenosine A2A receptor12,13 present in the cerebral vasculature and involved in autoregulation of CBF.14

We used state-of-the-art methods to visualise and analyse the microcirculation and real-time measurement of perivascular adenosine with enzymatic biosensors.

Material and methods

SECTION

Animals

PARAGRAPH

Male, three-month-old, Wistar rats (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) weighing 295–410 g were housed in plastic cages and fed a regular chow diet with free access to water.

They were exposed to a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle at constant room temperature and humidity.

The experiments were performed in the animal facilities associated with the Department of Hepatology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.

Chemicals

PARAGRAPH

All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Denmark A/S (Copenhagen, Denmark) except for ZM 241385, which was obtained Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK).

SECTION

Experimental procedures

PARAGRAPH

Anaesthesia was induced with isoflurane and 0.2–0.3 ml pentobarbital (50 mg/ml) administered in a tail vein.

Blood pressure was measured and blood samples were obtained with catheters (PE-50) placed in the femoral arteries and veins.

Body core temperature was monitored with a thermoprobe placed in the peritoneum.

The arterial catheters were flushed with heparin (50 IU/ml in saline), and one arterial catheter was connected to a pressure transducer.

The rats underwent tracheotomy, and were intubated and mechanically ventilated (Hallowell EMD; E-vet, Haderslev, Denmark) with a frequency of 60/min and a tidal volume of 5–10 ml with a mixture of atmospheric air and oxygen.

A capnograph connected to the respirator allowed the expiratory carbon dioxide level to be monitored continuously.

The temperature was kept at 37 °C with the aid of a heating blanket connected to the peritoneal thermoprobe.

Continuous recordings of arterial blood pressure were saved on a computer with the software program Perisoft (Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden).

PARAGRAPH

The head of the rat was fixed in a stereotactic instrument, and by a scalp incision, access to the surface of the frontal and parietal bones was achieved.

Soft tissue bleeding was controlled with electrocauterisation.

A cranial window measuring approximately 5 mm × 5 mm was cut with a dental burr above the parietal cortex.

Dura mater was exposed and carefully removed.

Next a plastic cylinder with an in- and outflow plastic tube was fixated to the bone surrounding the cranial window with the use of dental cement and served the purpose of an in situ perfusion chamber.

For illustrative purposes, separate experiments with bilateral cranial windows were prepared as previously described, and the perfusion chamber in those experiments was divided in the midline into two separate chambers, allowing use of different perfusion solutions for each hemisphere.

PARAGRAPH

Brain tissue was covered with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; pH 7.4, 1.25 mM sodium phosphate, 126 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glucose, 26 mM NaHCO3) perfused through the chamber at a rate of 5 ml/min.

Stable and normal baseline values of mean arterial pressure (MAP; >90 mmHg) and arterial partial pressures of oxygen (>100 mmHg) and carbon dioxide (35–45 mmHg) were obtained (Table 1), and then the perfusion recording was initiated.

High-resolution speckle contrast imaging video recordings were obtained (HR-PSI, Perimed) during the entire experiment.

After a stable baseline recording for 5 min, the perfusate was changed according to the following experimental groups:

aCSF with 10 mM NH4Cl (n = 10)

aCSF (n = 6)

aCSF with 10 mM NH4Cl and ZM 241385 (150 µM) (n = 8)

PARAGRAPH

The concentration of ZM 241385 in the perfusate was selected on the basis of previous reports from comparable studies of cortical microcirculation.15

PARAGRAPH

After 30 min, a 2-min haemorrhagic challenge was induced by withdrawal of arterial blood into a heparinized syringe until MAP was reduced to 50% of the baseline level within approximately 1 min.

After 2 min the blood was reinfused within 1 min, and flow and blood pressure were allowed to stabilize for 5–10 min.

Then a gradual exsanguination was performed by aspiration of small volumes of blood to induce a drop in MAP of 10 mmHg/min.

SECTION

Flow data analysis

PARAGRAPH

The flow video recordings were analysed with the software program PimSoft (Perimed), where regions of interest were defined according to anatomical structures identified by light microscopy.

Representative areas corresponding to arterioles, venules, and cortex void of small vessels were registered, and flow values in these areas were obtained for the entire experimental course.

Averaged values (2 min) of flow velocity and MAP were calculated at the baseline, after 30 min, and during and after the haemorrhagic challenge.

Relative changes in the surface area of the arteriolar bed were calculated.

During the gradual exsanguination, MAP and flow were averaged every 2 s, and with a flow preservation curve were fitted with one-knot linear splines with use of a script written in the statistical software package R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) (Fig. 1A).

With this fit, the parameters representing the lower limit of autoregulation (the knot) and the slope of the autoregulatory plateau (autoregulatory index) were estimated.

The raw video data were analysed to generate two-dimensional maps of the flow parameter estimates on the surface of the brain with use of a custom-made script for the commercial software program MATLAB (release 2015b, The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).

Periarteriolar adenosine detection

PARAGRAPH

We measured the periarteriolar adenosine levels in separate groups of rats undergoing the same experimental protocol as described earlier.

Microelectrode biosensors sensitive to adenosine and a null sensor were connected to a potentiostat (Duo-Stat ME200+; Sarissa Biomedical Ltd, Coventry, UK) and polarized in the perfusion chamber against a subcutaneous reference electrode.

The perfusion chamber was perfused with recycling aCSF at a flow rate of 5 ml/min.

The sensitivity to adenosine was investigated by our changing the perfusion medium to 10 µM adenosine in aCSF.

Then sensors were inserted into the parietal cortex as close as possible to an arteriole without affecting the vascular flow.

After 10–15 min of equilibration, the experiment was started with 30 min of exposure to ammonium chloride (n = 8) or aCSF (n = 6), followed by a haemorrhagic challenge started as described earlier.

After the experiment the sensors were retracted to the perfusion chamber, and a calibration curve was obtained by our changing the perfusate to aCSF containing 10 µM adenosine.

The signal difference between the adenosine and null sensors, measured in nanoamperes, was used for estimation of the tissue concentration of adenosine assuming a linear response.

SECTION

Excluded rats

PARAGRAPH

Rats were excluded from the analysis if we observed unintentional traumatic injury to the exposed brain tissue, uncontrollable bleeding from the edge of the cranial window disturbing the flow recordings, or abnormal blood gases.

This accounted for 13 rats in total (four of these in the biosensor experiments), which resulted in an uneven distribution of rats between groups.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Results are given as the medians (interquartile range).

We did not make any assumption with regard to data distribution, and chose non-parametric statistical tests.

The sample size was based on experience from prior studies.

Comparisons between groups were done by the Kruskal–Wallis rank-sum test.

Post hoc multiple comparisons were done according to Trewby and Williams.5

A p value <0.05 was considered significant.

Results

PARAGRAPH

Exposure to ammonium for 30 min led to increased flow velocity compared with that in the control group (aCSF) and a more pronounced flow decrease during the haemorrhagic challenge, with a tendency for attenuation with the addition of ZM 241385 (Table 2).

Ammonium exposure led to a significant increase in the arteriolar surface area, with a relative increase from the baseline of 163% (182%).

The vasodilation tended to be less with addition of ZM 241385 [108% (85%)] but was still significantly different from that in the control group [12% (82%), p <0.05].

During recovery after reinfusion of blood, reactive hyperaemia was observed, but without significant differences between groups.

PARAGRAPH

The lower limit of flow preservation did not differ significantly between groups.

However, the autoregulatory index of arterioles increased after exposure to ammonium.

This change was not seen with the addition of ZM 241385 to the perfusate (Table 3).

A characteristic scatter plot of the flow preservation curves in the three groups is presented in Fig. 1A, and two-dimensional maps of the autoregulatory indices are given in Fig. 1B,C comparing the interventions in bilateral cranial windows in representative experiments.

PARAGRAPH

The perivascular adenosine level was increased after exposure to ammonium and responded to the haemorrhagic challenge with a marked decrease, which was in contrast to what was observed in the aCSF group, where adenosine levels were low and stable during hypotension (Fig. 2A–C).

In supplementary groups we compared the observations made during exposure of hypoxic rats to ammonium (10% oxygen for 10 min, n = 5) and in rats topically exposed to 12.5 mM potassium chloride for 30 min (n = 7).

We did not find comparable arteriolar flow changes as the flow increased by 5.7% (3.2%) and 10.6% (22.6%), respectively.

However, the autoregulatory index increased after hypoxia to 0.31 (0.13) flow units per millimetre of mercury, a level similar to that after ammonium exposure.

The autoregulatory index was slightly increased during hyperkalaemic conditions: 0.18 (0.19) flow units per millimetre of mercury.

There was tendency towards an increase in perivascular adenosine level during hypoxia, but less than after ammonium exposure (Fig. 2D).

A high concentration of potassium did not lead to release of adenosine, and supportively no beneficial effect of blocking the cation–chloride cotransporter NKCC1 with bumetanide (500 µM, n = 6) was seen on the microcirculation after ammonium exposure [flow increase after 30 min of 25.0% (25.6%); flow change during haemorrhagic challenge of −22.9% (2.9%); reactive hyperaemia 19.0% (9.9%); autoregulatory index 0.66 (0.24) flow units per millimetre of mercury].

PARAGRAPH

As a positive control we compared our findings in a group of rats exposed to topically applied adenosine (50 µM) added to aCSF (n = 7).

Here we found parallel changes in the microcirculation with an increase in arteriolar flow velocity of 12.6% (8.2%) after 30 min, an increase in the arteriolar surface area of 100% (83%), a change in flow velocity during the haemorrhagic challenge of −20.8% (10.2%), and an increase during reactive hyperaemia of 19.7% (36.3%).

The autoregulatory index after adenosine exposure was 0.20 (0.24) flow units per millimetre of mercury.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Rat cortex exposed to topically applied ammonium chloride was affected by arteriolar vasodilation and increased flow of the microcirculation of the brain.

This was shown to be directly associated with a perivascular increase in the adenosine tone and impaired preservation of flow during a hypotensive challenge.

Furthermore, we investigated flow preservation properties in more detail by estimating the autoregulatory capacity.

We confirmed that ammonium exposure leads to impaired autoregulation, which is in line with previous observations in both patients4 and experimental models.9

As a significant novel finding we were able to restore the ability of flow preservation by selectively antagonizing the adenosine A2A receptor.

This suggests that adenosine may play a central and causal role in the development of hyperperfusion of the brain during severe hyperammonaemia;16–18 indeed, we also observed that topically applied adenosine on the brain surface induces flow changes comparable to those seen after ammonium exposure.

The tight coupling of flow and metabolism in the brain is an important prerequisite for normal organ function and is controlled by the neurovascular unit.19

The ability to direct blood flow to areas with higher metabolic demands relies on a redundant system of mediators cross-talking between neurons, interneurons, glia cells, and vascular structures composing the neurovascular unit.

The most important mediators are believed to be hydrogen ions, potassium ions, oxygen, arachidonic acid metabolites, and adenosine.20

Specifically, adenosine is believed to be a key mediator of the functional hyperaemia,21 and can be released either from the intracellular compartment following ATP utilization or from extracellular degradation of ATP released as a purinergic signalling molecule.22

In the extracellular space adenosine interacts with A2A receptors in the vascular smooth muscle cells and induces vasodilation and thereby increases the local blood flow.23,24

We previously studied indicators of cerebral dysmetabolism during severe HE and experimental models thereof and interpreted our observations as indicative of a so-called cytopathic hypoxia induced by ammonia,25,26 where the metabolism appears anaerobic in spite of normal oxygen delivery.

This situation with anaerobic metabolism would be expected to trigger release of adenosine.

However, given the redundant nature of the flow regulation in the neurovascular unit and the often multifactorial pathogenesis of HE during, for example, acute-on-chronic liver failure, it is unlikely that the cerebral flow disturbances seen in those cases27,28 are caused by the rather simple line of events we have described in the present study.

By contrast, HE in severe cases of inborn urea cycle disorders and acute liver failure is often characterized by rapid development of cerebral dysfunction and substantial hyperammonaemia, and here our mechanistic findings might be of more relevance.

PARAGRAPH

Some limitations in this study need to be addressed.

Firstly, we used high concentrations of ammonium in the perfusate, exceeding what is normally seen in the plasma of patients with HE.

The choice of 10 mM ammonium chloride was based on our previous experience of rat models of liver failure,10,26,29,30 where ammonium plasma concentrations in the range of 1–5 mM were found suitable for experimental studies with development of relevant pathophysiology within a reasonable time frame of 1–4 h.

The choice was furthermore supported by data from a study of the effect of topically applied ammonium chloride (10 mM) on mouse brain, where in vivo tissue concentrations of ammonium of approximately 5 mM were achieved.31

We acknowledge that it might not be appropriate to extrapolate and translate our conclusions to very mild degrees of hyperammonaemia, but we still find our observations relevant to the understanding of the cerebral pathophysiology in patients with liver failure, brain oedema, and absent autoregulation as discussed earlier.

We did not include dose finding experiments in our study, and the choice of the concentration of ammonium, adenosine, ZM 241385, potassium, and bumetanide was based on the literature.

Secondly, we realize that the use of general anaesthesia in itself can affect the cerebral microcirculation and autoregulation thereof.

More specifically, isoflurane and pentobarbital have been shown to affect directly flow velocity and also to increase the autoregulatory index.32,33

However, since all groups in our study received the same anaesthetic agents, it is unlikely to have affected the observed differences.

Thirdly, the process leading from ammonium exposure to adenosine release was not elucidated in our study, but we compared our findings with those in other pathophysiological conditions (i.e. hypoxia and topical hyperkalaemia).

This selection was based on recent reports of ammonium-induced impairment of astrocyte potassium buffering,31 where the extracellular potassium level increased in brain cortex after exposure to ammonium and possibly could mediate a release of adenosine as seen in microdialysis studies from >30 years ago.34

To some extent similarities between ammonium exposure, hypoxia, and hyperkalaemia were observed in the microcirculation, and it is tempting to suggest that exposure of the brain to high levels of ammonium induces release of potassium to the extracellular space, as seen during hypoxia, and this in turn leads to release of adenosine, affecting the vasculature as discussed earlier.

We did not design our study to investigate this mechanism specifically, but our data are supportive of the concept.

If this hypothesis holds true, it would be tempting to explore the potential benefits of treating cerebral complications from hyperammonaemia with adenosine receptor antagonists in more detail and use clinically more relevant outcomes.

Limited amounts of data from this perspective have been published,35–37 and whether this represents a novel treatment modality presently remains an unanswered question.

One aspect to be looked at carefully would be the effect of systemic adenosine receptor antagonism on splanchnic blood flow in patients with cirrhosis.

Specifically, the so-called hepatic buffer response is regulated by periportal adenosine release that secures sufficient arterial blood flow when portal blood flow decreases.38

Whether adenosine receptor antagonism in patients with portal hypertension will be harmful (hypoperfusion) or beneficial (reduced portal pressure) is not obvious.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, ammonium chloride induces changes in cerebral microcirculation and is associated with an increased adenosine tone.

The most pronounced changes were observed in cerebral arterioles and might play a significant role in the pathogenesis of HE and brain viability during liver failure.

Since co-administration of the adenosine A2A receptor antagonist ZM 241385 counteracted the detrimental effect of ammonium chloride on the microcirculation, adenosine antagonism might be a potential treatment target worth investigating further.
