TITLE

Regulation of epithelial injury and bile duct obstruction by NLRP3, IL-1R1 in experimental biliary atresia

PARAGRAPH

Biliary atresia is a severe inflammatory and obstructive disease of bile ducts occurring in infancy.

Although the cause is unknown, activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems injures the bile duct epithelium.

In this study we found that patientsâ€™ livers had increased expression of inflammasome genes.

Using mice engineered to inactivate individual inflammasome genes, the epithelial injury and bile duct obstruction were prevented by the loss of Il1r1 or Nlrp3, with a decreased activation of natural killer cells and expression of cytokines and chemokines.

In contrast, the loss of Casp1 did not change the disease phenotype.

Combined, the findings point to a differential role of inflammasome gene products in the pathogenic mechanisms of biliary atresia.
