TITLE

Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and lactate dehydrogenase are targets for therapy of acute liver failure

PARAGRAPH

Acute liver failure is a rapidly progressive deterioration of liver function resulting in high mortality.

In experimental mouse models of acute liver failure, we found that two metabolic enzymes, namely pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and lactic dehydrogenase, translocate to the nucleus resulting in detrimental gene expression.

Treatment with an inhibitor of these two enzymes was found to reduce liver damage and to improve survival.
