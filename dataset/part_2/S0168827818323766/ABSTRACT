ABSTRACT

TITLE

MicroRNA-378 promotes hepatic inflammation and fibrosis via modulation of the NF-κB-TNFα pathway

PARAGRAPH

The progression of hepatosteatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a critical step in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular cancer.

However, the underlying mechanism(s) for this progression is essentially unknown.

This study was designed to determine the role of miR-378 in regulating NASH progression.

PARAGRAPH

We used immunohistochemistry, luciferase assays and immunoblotting to study the role of miR-378 in modulating an inflammatory pathway.

Wild-type mice kept on a high-fat diet (HFD) were injected with miR-378 inhibitors or a mini-circle expression system containing miR-378, to study loss and gain-of functions of miR-378.

PARAGRAPH

MiR-378 expression is increased in livers of dietary obese mice and patients with NASH.

Further studies revealed that miR-378 directly targeted Prkag2 that encodes AMP-activated protein kinase γ 2 (AMPKγ2).

AMPK signaling negatively regulates the NF-κB-TNFα inflammatory axis by increasing deacetylase activity of sirtuin 1.

By targeting Prkag2, miR-378 reduced sirtuin 1 activity and facilitated an inflammatory pathway involving NF-κB-TNFα.

In contrast, miR-378 knockdown induced expression of Prkag2, increased sirtuin 1 activity and blocked the NF-κB-TNFα axis.

Additionally, knockdown of increased Prkag2 offset the inhibitory effects of miR-378 inhibitor on the NF-κB-TNFα axis, suggesting that AMPK signaling mediates the role of miR-378 in facilitating this inflammatory pathway.

Liver-specific expression of miR-378 triggered the development of NASH and fibrosis by activating TNFα signaling.

Ablation of TNFα in miR-378-treated mice impaired the ability of miR-378 to facilitate hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, suggesting that TNFα signaling is required for miR-378 to promote NASH.

PARAGRAPH

MiR-378 plays a key role in the development of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis by positively regulating the NF-κB-TNFα axis.

MiR-378 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NASH.
