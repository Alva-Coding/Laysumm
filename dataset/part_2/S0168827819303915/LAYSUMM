TITLE

The epigenetic regulator SIRT6 protects the liver from alcohol-induced tissue injury by reducing oxidative stress in mice

PARAGRAPH

The liver, the primary organ for ethanol metabolism, can be damaged by the byproducts of ethanol metabolism, including reactive oxygen species.

In this study, we have identified a key epigenetic regulator SIRT6 that plays a critical role in protecting the liver from oxidative stress-induced liver injury.

Thus, our data suggest that SIRT6 may be a potential therapeutic target for alcohol-related liver disease.
