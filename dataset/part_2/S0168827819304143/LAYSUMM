TITLE

Decentralized care with generic direct-acting antivirals in the management of chronic hepatitis C in a public health care setting

PARAGRAPH

We assessed the safety and efficacy of public health care using no-cost all-oral generic direct-acting antiviral drugs against hepatitis C in the state of Punjab, India.

The goal is elimination of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) by 2030 and involves primary care providers at 25 sites in the state.

We enrolled 48,088 individuals (63.8% male; mean age 42.1â€¯years; 80.5% rural; 14.8% compensated cirrhotic; 69.9% genotype 3) between 18th June 2016 to 31st July 2018.

Cure was achieved in 91.6% of patients, demonstrating that decentralized care of CHC with generic all-oral regimens is safe and effective.
