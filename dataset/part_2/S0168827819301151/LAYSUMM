TITLE

Clinical utility of genomic analysis in adults with idiopathic liver disease

PARAGRAPH

We performed whole-exome sequencing in 19 adult patients with unexplained liver disease after an unrevealing conventional work-up performed by a hepatologist.

In 5 cases, genomic analysis led to a diagnosis and informed treatment and management of the disease.

Therefore, we suggest using whole-exome sequencing in the evaluation and management of adults with unexplained liver disease.
