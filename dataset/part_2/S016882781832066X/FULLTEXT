TITLE

The P2X4 purinergic receptor regulates hepatic myofibroblast activation during liver fibrogenesis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Beside huge regenerative properties, the liver classically undergoes fibrogenesis in association with liver repair during chronic injury, impairing hepatic functions with high morbidity and mortality.1

As well as in other organs, in the liver, the main cellular contributor to excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition is the myofibroblast, derived from hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and/or portal fibroblasts2 after acute or during chronic liver injury.

Hepatic myofibroblasts (hMF) are characterized by αSMA (ACTA2) expression, contractile properties, and by overexpressed ECM components and regulators.

The acquisition of an ECM remodeling phenotype in hMF during liver injury is strongly dependent on a complex network of cellular interactions within the liver microenvironment, involving a large number of cytokines and growth factors.1

Nevertheless, the so-called “danger activated molecular patterns”, released by dying or stressed cells during injury, including extracellular ATP, also constitute a powerful signaling network which impact on liver fibrogenetic processes.3,4

In general, signaling via extracellular ATP and its receptors, i.e. P2Y (G protein-coupled receptors) and P2X (ligand-gated ion channels), is reported to have regulatory impact on fundamental processes like secretion, contraction, survival and proliferation in a wide spectrum of cells and tissues, including the liver.5,6

ATP release from cells occurs under different stress conditions, particularly under osmotic or mechanical challenge.7

In the liver, each cell type expresses its own repertoire of purinoceptor subtypes and ectoATPases,8 P2X4 (P2RX4) and P2X7 (P2RX7) often being predominant among P2 receptor subtypes.9,10

We previously observed robust ATP release from the liver immediately after partial hepatectomy (PH) in rats and in human living transplant donors, resulting from intrahepatic mechanical stress and contributing to hepatocyte cell cycle entry.11

In a recent study in mice, we proposed that during liver regeneration after PH, ATP signaling through P2X4 contributed to the control of biliary homeostasis, with a resulting impact on hepatocyte protection and proliferation, through basic mechanisms involving exocytosis of lysosomes, an organelle in which P2X4 is strongly expressed.10

Beside evidence for a purinergic-dependent regulation of liver repair after acute injury,10–13 only few data are available as far as chronic liver injury and fibrogenesis are concerned.

Previous studies in the context of liver fibrosis reported that adenosine (ATP's breakdown product), and its A1 and A2 receptors provide profibrogenic signals,14 at least in part through modulation of macrophage or HSC activation,15 although some contradictory results have been reported.16

Regarding the P2 side of purinergic input signaling during liver fibrosis, while some P2Y isoforms have been reported to be expressed and to play some role in HSC-myofibroblast differentiation,17,18 most of the recent studies were focused on P2X7 signaling.

In mice, pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of P2X7 resulted in less carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced liver fibrosis,19,20 through incompletely defined cell-specific mechanisms, including impact on splanchnic hemodynamics20 and myofibroblast activation and/or inflammasome induction.21–23

However, a clear picture of the purinergic-related control of liver fibrogenesis is still lacking, in particular according to cell types, ligands and receptors involved, and finally depending on the experimental model used.

Indeed, biliary and non-biliary type fibrosis appeared to exhibit differential sensitivity to purinergic signals and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.16,18

Importantly, other P2 receptors, including the highly expressed P2X4, were not investigated in the context of liver fibrogenesis.

As P2X4 was reported to regulate secretion of inflammatory mediators,24 cytoskeleton organisation25 and collagen deposition26 in extrahepatic sites, we aimed at studying the impact of P2X4 on hMF phenotype and liver fibrogenesis.

PARAGRAPH

In the present work, using both in vivo and in vitro approaches, we provide data showing that P2X4 had a profibrogenic effect through an impact on hMF activated phenotype (contraction, migration, fibrotic ECM accumulation and regulation).

Our data ultimately suggest that P2X4 antagonism may be of interest in the treatment of liver fibrosis.

Results

SECTION

The lack of P2X4 protects the liver from fibrosis

PARAGRAPH

Fifteen days after BDL as well as after six weeks of MCD diet, P2x4-KO mice exhibited significantly less collagen protein and transcript accumulation in the liver compared to WT mice (Fig. 1A), while liver injury or steatosis were similar (Fig. S1A,B).

As we reported that P2X7 expression was downregulated in P2x4-KO mice, and in the light of previous studies suggesting that P2X7 inhibition was associated with reduced liver fibrogenic response,30 we challenged P2x7-KO mice with BDL.

As shown, WT and P2x7-KO mice exhibited similar phenotypes 15 days after BDL or upon MCD diet (Fig. S2), suggesting that the hypofibrotic phenotype observed in P2x4-KO mice was not related to P2X7 deficiency.

P2x4-KO mice also displayed reduced ductular reaction known to be associated with liver fibrosis,31 as revealed by CK19 (Krt19) expression (Fig. S3).

Accordingly, while hepatic αSMA staining and transcript expression increased at 7 and 15 days after BDL in WT mice, this upregulation was significantly less pronounced in P2x4-KO animals (Fig. 1B).

Similar results were observed after administering an MCD diet (Fig. 1B).

In line with these data, whilst WT mice exhibited a profibrogenic pattern after BDL or MCD diet, consisting of an upregulation of TGF-β1 (Tgfb1) (Fig. 1C), Timp1 and Mmp2, 9 and 13 mRNAs, the lack of P2X4 receptor led to a significantly reduced mRNA induction of Timp1 and Mmp9, as well as Mmp2 (Fig. S4), which is strongly related to cirrhosis progression.32

Interestingly, 7 days after BDL or after 11 days of MCD diet, Mmp13 which is known to be involved in fibrosis recovery,33 was upregulated in P2x4-KO compared with WT mice (Fig. S4D).

Of note, the expression of Il6, Tnf, Mcp1 (Ccl2) and F4/80 (Adgre1) was similar in BDL or MCD diet challenged WT and P2x4-KO livers, suggesting that inflammatory cells in these experimental models were not significantly affected by the lack of P2X4 (Fig. S1C).

These data indicating a shift towards a fibrolytic pattern in the absence of P2X4, suggest that this receptor plays a fibrogenic role during chronic liver injury.

Intriguingly, we did not observe any difference in liver fibrosis between CCl4-injured WT and P2x4-KO mice (Fig. S5A).

In line with this result, P2X4 expression was significantly upregulated after BDL as well as upon MCD diet, whereas it was not in the livers from CCl4-treated mice (Fig. S5B, 4C).

Whether P2X4 would impact a particular hMF subpopulation more involved in BDL and MCD than in CCl4 models remains to be investigated (34,35 and Fig. S5D).

PARAGRAPH

As shown (Fig. 2A–C), P2X4 mRNA and protein were expressed in mouse and human isolated hMFs, as well as in mouse and human fibrotic liver (Fig. 2D, E; Fig. S5B, C).

Analysis of the different hMF markers revealed that our isolated mouse and human hMF exhibited mainly a portal MF rather than an HSC-derived expression profile (Fig. S7A).

Importantly, the hMF expression repertoires of other P2 receptors (Fig. 2A) as well as adenosine receptors and ectonuceotidases (Fig. S7B) were quite similar in WT and P2x4-KO mice.

In addition to the BDL and MCD diet experimental settings, in human patients with chronic biliary (primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis) or non-biliary (alcoholic cirrhosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and chronic viral hepatitis C) diseases, P2X4 expression was also upregulated compared with control samples (Fig. 2D).

Furthermore, the higher the METAVIR score, the greater the upregulation of P2X4 (Fig. 2E).

Taken together, these observations led us to hypothesize that P2X4 may impact activation and/or fibrogenic properties of hMF during liver fibrosis.

SECTION

P2X4 contributes to hMF activation

PARAGRAPH

Studies on isolated hMF from WT mice showed that αSMA was upregulated upon ATP (the endogenous P2X4 agonist) treatment, whereas it had no effect on P2x4-KO hMF (Fig. 3A), suggesting that P2X4 stimulation impacted hMF activation status.

Supporting this hypothesis, P2x4-KO hMF or WT mouse and human hMF transfected with a P2X4 siRNA, displayed a remarkably lower basal and ATP-stimulated αSMA protein expression, compared with WT or control cells (Fig. 3B, C and Fig. S8).

Interestingly, TGF-β1 treatment restored similarly increased αSMA expression in P2x4-KO and WT hMF, pointing to a defect in hMF activation in the cells lacking P2X4 (Fig. 3A).

Therefore, P2X4 expression and stimulation may control the reversible activation state and fibrogenic properties, namely, contraction, migration, ECM remodeling and profibrogenic secretion of human and murine hMF.

SECTION

The lack of P2X4 is associated with less profibrogenic properties in hMF

PARAGRAPH

In agreement with the αSMA expression data reported above (Figs. 1 and 3), collagen gel contraction experiments showed that the lack of P2X4 reduced the basal hMF ability to contract and that ATP significantly enhanced contraction in WT but not P2x4-KO hMF (Fig. 4A).

Again, only a TGF-β1 treatment significantly enhanced gel contraction in P2x4-KO hMF.

Of note, P2X4 expression did not affect TGF-β1 release nor TGF-β1 receptors expression in hMF (Fig. S9A, B).

PARAGRAPH

On the basis of these data, and since integrin-based interactions between the cytoskeleton and ECM also contribute to build contractile forces in hMF, we studied the impact of P2X4 on cell adhesion.

Even though expression of the major integrin mRNAs was similar in WT and P2x4-KO hMF (Fig. S9C), adhesive WT hMF number on fibronectin-coated plates increased with time upon ATP treatment, whereas this was not observed for P2x4-KO hMF (Fig. 4B).

PARAGRAPH

We then studied cell migration, another key hMF activation feature during fibrogenesis,36,37 we found that 24 h after making a wound on confluent cells, ATP-stimulated migration of WT but not P2x4-KO hMF (Fig. 4C).

PARAGRAPH

In addition, compared to WT, P2x4-KO hMF as well as murine and human hMF transfected with P2X4 siRNA exhibited significantly less collagen protein expression (Fig. 5A) and, conversely significantly more expression and release of the collagen degrading enzyme MMP2 (Fig. 5B).

Strikingly, the matrix degradation inhibitors TIMP1 and PAI-1 (SERPINE1) expression and release were upregulated upon ATP treatment in WT mouse and control human hMF but not in P2x4-KO mouse hMF, nor in P2X4 siRNA-treated mouse and human hMF (Fig. 5C, D).

In the same line, the proinflammatory cytokine IL6, as well as the promitogenic and chemotactic PDGF-BB (Pdgfb) and the angiogenic Vegfa were significantly less induced (expression and release) upon ATP treatment in P2x4-KO than WT hMF (Fig. S10).

As P2X receptor stimulation with ATP classically induces Ca2+ entry,38 we tested for P2X4 contribution to this effect in hMF and found that the P2X4 antagonist 5-BDBD significantly inhibited ATP (10 μM)-induced Ca2+ entry in WT hMFs (Fig. 6A).

Importantly 5-BDBD had no significant impact on ATP induced Ca2+ entry in P2x4-KO hMF (Fig. S11).

Therefore, we searched for potential P2X4-dependent transcription factor activation in hMF, that may underlie the hypofibrogenic profile observed in the absence of this receptor.

As shown (Fig. 6B, C), it turned out that the activation of NF-κB, STAT3, ATF2, and p38 kinase, which are all reported to contribute to hMF activation39,40 and be linked to calcium signaling,41 at least in part depends on P2X4-related signaling in hMF.

PARAGRAPH

Taken together, these in vitro data suggested that purinergic P2X4-mediated signaling drives hMF activation and thus profibrogenic phenotype, through the regulation of cell contraction, adhesion and migration, as well as by the control of matrix synthesis/degradation balance.

These observations fit well with the in vivo observed hypofibrotic phenotype in P2x4-KO mice.

SECTION

P2X4 mediates lysosomal exocytosis in hMF

PARAGRAPH

Knowing that P2X4 is highly enriched in lysosomes, as shown on lysosome-enriched hMF preparations (Fig. 7A),10 we focused on the involvement of P2X4 in the control of lysosomal exocytosis in hMF, as a potential link between purinergic signaling, secretory molecules impacting hMF activation, and the hypo-fibrogenic phenotype observed in the absence of P2X4.

As shown (Fig. 7B), ATP stores were localized in lysotracker positive vesicles in WT mouse hMF as observed in murine hepatocytes10,11 in which we hypothesized that P2X4 may control ATP release through lysosomal exocytosis.10

We then looked at fibronectin- and TGF-β1-stimulated ATP release, and found that it was largely inhibited in P2x4-KO compared with WT hMF (Fig. 7C).

In line with these data, exocytosis was impaired in P2x4-KO hMF, as revealed by dextran loading experiments (Fig. 7D).

Finally, lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase measurements in hMF supernatants from control and stimulated (with fibronectin and TGF-β1) cells further supported that the lack of P2X4 was associated with altered lysosomal exocytosis (Fig. 7E).

Taken together, these data argue for a regulatory role of P2X4 in the process of Ca2+-dependent lysosomal exocytosis in hMF, with a functional impact on the hMF activation phenotype, in particular through the control of their secretory profile.

Pharmacological P2X4 inhibition reduces fibrosis progression

PARAGRAPH

In line with the data presented above, we found a significant reduction in αSMA expression and contraction capacity in WT hMF upon treatment with the P2X4 antagonist 5-BDBD (Fig. 8A, B).

As shown, 5-BDBD-treated hMF reached values very close to basal levels observed in the lack of P2x4-KO.

Importantly, 5-BDBD had no significant effect on αSMA expression and hMF contraction in P2x4-KO hMF.

PARAGRAPH

Finally, in vivo, with the aim of stopping the progression of hMF activation during fibrogenesis after BDL, we treated WT mice with 5-BDBD, from 7 days (when hMF were already activated) towards 15 days after surgery.

Compared to vehicle-treated mice, 5-BDBD-treated animals exhibited significantly less αSMA mRNA expression and immunofluorescent staining area on liver sections (Fig. 8C), as well as reduced collagen accumulation in the liver (Fig. 8D).

Of note, proinflammatory cytokine expression was not changed by P2X4 antagonism (Fig. S12).

Taken together, these data confirmed that antagonizing P2X4 blunted hMF activation and protected the liver from BDL-induced fibrogenesis.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

There is a large body of evidence linking tissue fibrosis and purinergic signaling, the impact of which is either beneficial or aggravating, depending on the considered organ.3,4

However, the global view of purine agonists and respective receptors involved in liver fibrogenesis remains poorly delineated.3,4,42

In particular, while previous reports focused on adenosine and P2X7 receptors,19,20 nothing was known about other P2X receptors in the context of liver fibrogenesis, in particular for the highly expressed P2X4 that we showed to be involved in the control of acute liver repair.10

In the present study, we provided in vivo and in vitro data showing that P2X4-mediated signaling had a profibrogenic effect through an impact on hMF phenotype.

Our data demonstrate that P2X4 is the most highly expressed purinergic receptor in hMFs, where it regulates αSMA expression, cell contraction, adhesion and migration, as well as the release of profibrogenic mediators.

We provide evidence that these effects occur at least in part through P2X4-regulated lysosomal exocytosis and transcription factor activation.

During fibrogenesis, hMF are the target of multiple chemical and mechanical stimuli.1

The agonists involved include cytokines, growth factors, but also the so-called danger activated molecular patterns among which extracellular nucleotides have now acquired a recognized position.3,4

Our data suggest that P2X4-related signaling shifts the hMF phenotype toward a profibrogenic profile.

At least in part, these effects appeared to be related to P2X4-dependent regulation of lysosomal exocytosis, contributing to a secretory pattern through the release of profibrogenic/profibrolytic mediators (IL6, PDGFB, VEGFA, MMPs, PAI-1 and TIMPs) by hMF.

Our study further suggests that hMF also release ATP in a P2X4-dependent manner, likely providing a positive feedback loop on hMF activation.

These P2X4-dependent secretory effects are in line with previous reports suggesting that post-transcriptional regulation took place in hMF activation, namely through the calcium-dependent regulated exocytosis of TIMP143 or MMP9,44 with important impact on fibrogenesis.

We recently reported that hepatocyte P2X4 was involved in ATP release in the acute contexts of PH and BDL.10

Thus, we may speculate that in the chronic context, the lack (or the inhibition) of P2X4 may lead to less nucleotide release, providing a globally lower purinergic (i.e. profibrogenic) input in the injured liver.

The indirect impact on other P1 and P2 receptors that would become less stimulated, may contribute to the observed P2x4-KO phenotype.

In this respect, we found that the hMF purinoceptor and ectonucleotidase repertoire was not deeply remodeled in the absence of P2X4.

PARAGRAPH

Our data clearly demonstrate that P2X4-mediated purinergic signaling strongly controls hMF contraction, adhesion and migration.

These results are in line with the known P2X4-induced calcium entry (38, and this study) which has been linked with contraction and actin remodeling processes.25

What we found is in agreement with previous reports on purinergic (in particular P2X4) impact on cell adhesion and migration.45–47

One possible scenario is that P2X4 would position downstream along a mechanotransduction signaling cascade, receiving mechanical stimuli through a putative coupling with integrins, in line with previous reports in microglia and podocytes.25,48

In this respect, we did not find significant alterations in hMF integrin expression in the absence of P2X4.

Precise mechanisms involved in upstream P2X4 activation during fibrogenesis remain to be further explored and may be related to intra-lysosomal pH elevation49 and/or mechanical stress.50

PARAGRAPH

In summary, based on our data and current knowledge, we propose that during liver fibrogenesis, P2X4-related signals contribute to hMF activation at least in part through mechanisms involving lysosomal-dependent ATP release and secretion of profibrogenic molecules (Fig. S13).

We showed that antagonizing P2X4 during the course of fibrogenesis blunted hMF profibrogenic phenotype.

Together with in vitro experiments, these data suggest that antagonizing P2X4 may control the fibrogenic/fibrolytic balance51 and that targeting P2X4 may be an interesting anti-fibrosing strategy in chronic liver diseases.
