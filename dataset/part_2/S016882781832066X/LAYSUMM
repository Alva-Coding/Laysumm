TITLE

The P2X4 purinergic receptor regulates hepatic myofibroblast activation during liver fibrogenesis

PARAGRAPH

During chronic injury, the liver often repairs with fibrotic tissue, which impairs liver function, and for which there is currently no treatment.

We found that a previously unexplored pathway involving the purinergic receptor P2X4, can modulate fibrotic liver repair.

Therefore, this receptor could be of interest in the development of novel therapies for fibrotic liver diseases.
