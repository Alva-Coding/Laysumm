ABSTRACT

TITLE

Newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with advanced hepatitis C treated with DAAs: A prospective population study

PARAGRAPH

Direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) are safe and effective in patients with hepatitis C. Conflicting data were reported on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during/after therapy with DAAs.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of newly diagnosed HCC and associated risk factors in patients with advanced hepatitis C treated with DAAs.

PARAGRAPH

The study is based on the NAVIGATORE platform, a prospectively recording database of all patients with hepatitis C receiving DAAs in the Veneto region of Italy.

The inclusion criteria were: fibrosis stage ≥F3.

The exclusion criteria were: Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP)-C, liver transplantation before DAAs, history or presence of HCC, follow-up <4 weeks after starting DAAs.

A total of 3,917 out of 4,234 consecutive patients were included, with a mean follow-up of 536.2 ± 197.6 days.

PARAGRAPH

Overall, HCC was diagnosed in 55 patients.

During the first year, HCC incidence was 0.46% (95% CI 0.12–1.17) in F3, 1.49% (1.03–2.08) in CTP-A and 3.61% (1.86–6.31) in CTP-B cirrhotics; in the second year, HCC incidences were 0%, 0.2%, and 0.69%, respectively.

By multivariate analysis, HCC was significantly associated with an aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio ≥2.5 (hazard ratio [HR] 2.03; 95% CI 1.14–3.61; p = 0.016) and hepatitis B virus infection (HR 3.99; 1.24–12.91; p = 0.021).

Failure to achieve a sustained virological response was strongly associated with development of HCC (HR 9.09; 5.2–16.1; p = 0.0001).

A total of 29% of patients with HCC had an aggressive tumor, often seen in the early phase of treatment.

PARAGRAPH

These data, obtained in a large, prospective, population-based study, indicate that in patients with advanced hepatitis C receiving DAAs, the risk of “de novo” hepatocarcinoma during the first year is not higher, and might be lower, than that of untreated patients.

The risk further declines thereafter.

Early hepatocarcinoma appearance may reflect pre-existing, microscopic, undetectable tumors.
