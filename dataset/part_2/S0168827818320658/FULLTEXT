TITLE

Non-invasive prediction of esophageal varices by stiffness and platelet in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease cirrhosis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

The pandemic spreading of obesity and diabetes makes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) the most rapidly growing cause of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis,1 an increasing risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma,2 and an emerging indication for liver transplantation.3

Consistent with these data, the management of patients with NAFLD-related cirrhosis represents a challenge in terms of epidemiological, clinical and economic burden.

In this complex picture, the diagnosis of esophageal varices (EV) and especially large (grade 2/3) EV requiring primary prophylaxis (varices needing treatment [VNT]), is of paramount prognostic importance in all patients with cirrhosis, including those with NAFLD.4,5

However, VNT are not frequent in patients with compensated cirrhosis, and strategies to reduce the number of unnecessary esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedures have been proposed.

Recently, the Baveno VI guidelines proposed that compensated cirrhotic patients with a liver stiffness measurement (LSM) <20 kPa and a platelet count >150,000/μl can avoid screening endoscopy,6 the specificity of this strategy for excluding VNT being validated in different studies.7

Furthermore, expanded Baveno VI criteria, obtained by optimizing LSM and platelet count (PLT) values (<25 kPa and >110,000/μl, respectively), have also been proposed and demonstrated to spare a higher proportion of unnecessary EGD when compared to Baveno VI criteria.8

PARAGRAPH

Both Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria were proven to be reliable in large cohorts of patients with compensated cirrhosis, mostly of viral and/or alcoholic etiologies, while patients with NAFLD-related cirrhosis are absent or under-represented.

This is a significant limitation considering that in patients with NAFLD-related cirrhosis, LSM could also account for the severity of steatosis and obesity.9,10

Furthermore, studies assessing the diagnostic accuracy of Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria considered LSM values obtained only by M probe.

However, there is a high prevalence of obesity in patients with NAFLD, resulting in the frequent need to measure LSM by XL probe in cases of M probe failure.

PARAGRAPH

We aimed to validate the Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria in patients with compensated cirrhosis due to NAFLD, also taking into account potential differences in LSM values from M and XL probes.

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Patients selection

PARAGRAPH

Data from 790 patients fulfilling the aforementioned inclusion criteria and prospectively recruited at the first diagnosis of NAFLD-related compensated cirrhosis in 10 different centers were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed.

PARAGRAPH

Inclusion criteria were presence of a reliable LSM and of an EGD within six months of LSM.

LSM was obtained by FibroScan® machine by using M and/or XL probe.

In some centers only the M prove was available, in some others both M and XL probes were available.

When both probes were available some centers used the XL probe only in case of failure of the M probe, some others measured LSM by both probes.

Cirrhosis was diagnosed by histology11 and/or by LSM >11.5 kPa for M probe12 and >11 kPa for XL probe.13

In patients without histology, diagnosis of NAFLD required detection of ultrasonographic steatosis plus at least one criterion of the metabolic syndrome (obesity, diabetes, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia).

Other causes of liver disease were ruled out, including alcohol intake >20 g/day during the previous year (evaluated by interview of patients on amount, frequency and type, and confirmed by at least one family member), viral (hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis C antibody and anti-human immunodeficiency virus negativity) and autoimmune hepatitis, hereditary hemochromatosis, and alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency.

Patients with advanced (Child Pugh B or C) cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, EV banding, portal or splenic vein thrombosis and splenectomy were excluded.

The study cohort finally included 372 patients from the Centre d’Investigation de la Fibrose Hépatique, Bordeaux University Hospital, 110 patients from the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, McGill University Health Centre of Montreal QC, 104 patients for the Section of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Palermo, 63 patients from the Hepatology Unit, Ospedale San Giuseppe University of Milan, 36 patients from the Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Torino, 35 patients from the Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 25 patients from the Swiss Liver Center, 21 patients from the Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, Ca' Granda IRCCS Foundation, Policlinico Hospital, University of Milan, 12 patients from the Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust, Freeman Hospital, and 12 patients from the Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale e Clinica, University of Florence.

PARAGRAPH

The study was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration, and with local and national laws.

Approval was obtained from the Hospital Internal Review Boards and their Ethics Committees, and written informed consent for the study was obtained from all patients.

SECTION

Patients evaluation

PARAGRAPH

Clinical and anthropometric data, including body mass index (BMI), the presence of arterial hypertension and type 2 diabetes, were collected at the time of enrollment.

The same day a 12 h overnight fasting blood sample was drawn to determine serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, PLT, albumin, total bilirubin, international normalized ratio, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and plasma glucose concentration.

PARAGRAPH

Transient elastography was performed with the FibroScan (Echosens, Paris, France) medical device, using the M and/or XL probes.

In each center, LSM was assessed after at least 4 h fasting, by a trained operator who had previously performed at least 300 determinations in patients with chronic liver disease.

Only patients with 10 valid measurements and with reliable results according to published criteria were enrolled.14

PARAGRAPH

EGD was performed by a small number of experienced operators at each Hospital.

Patients were excluded from this study if there was more than a six-month time interval between transient elastography and EGD examinations.

At endoscopy, high-risk EV which warrant primary prophylaxis against EV bleeding were defined by medium or large size or the presence of high-risk stigmata findings (red wale marks, cherry red spots).6

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Continuous variables were summarized as mean ± SD, and categorical variables as frequency and percentage.

PARAGRAPH

The training set was defined as the subcohort of patients for whom LSM were available by both M and XL probes, while the remaining patients with LSM measurements taken from either M probe or XL probe, but not both, acted as validation sets.

Patients in the training set were used to find two different combined thresholds of LSM and PLT, one for the M and the other for the XL probe, which maximized the absolute number of spared endoscopies, while keeping the risk of missed VNTs below 5% (constraining the negative predictive value [NPV] to at least 0.95).

The 5% false negative rate of undetected VNT was agreed as a reasonable criterion by experts in the Baveno VI consensus conference and later adopted by the American Gastroenterological Association and several other authors.6

The performance of thresholds were subsequently evaluated in their respective validation sets.

PARAGRAPH

Baveno VI (LSM <20 kPa and PLT >150,000) and expanded Baveno VI (LSM <25 kPa and PLT >110,000) criteria were also evaluated in both training and validation sets.

PARAGRAPH

Performance evaluations were made in terms of number and percentage of spared endoscopies, number and percentage of undetected EV, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios.

PARAGRAPH

All the analyses were performed using the R statistical computing environment.

Results

SECTION

Patient characteristics

PARAGRAPH

The baseline characteristics of the 790 patients with NAFLD-related compensated cirrhosis (682 Child Pugh A5, and 108 Child Pugh A6) included in the study are shown (Table 1).

Mean age was 62.3 years, with a 55% prevalence of males.

Sixty-two percent of patients were obese, and diabetes and arterial hypertension were present in 62.8% and 61.1% of cases, respectively.

The characteristics of the population split by center are provided (Table S1).

Another 56 patients with NAFLD-related compensated cirrhosis were not included in the study because LSM was not reliable.14

This cohort, compared to the 790 patients enrolled, had similar age (61 ± 12 years) and similar prevalence of male gender (60.7%), and of VNT (10.7%), with higher BMI (35.1 ± 8.0 kg/m2), the latter being the main cause of LSM unreliability.

PARAGRAPH

Liver cirrhosis was diagnosed by histology in 34.4% of patients.

EV were present in 31.5% of cases, and VNT in 11.5%.

The prevalence of EV (55.5% vs. 27.4%; p <0.001) and of VNT (29.6% vs. 8.6%; p <0.001) was higher in Child Pugh A6 compared to A5 patients.

LSM was similar in patients with histological diagnosis of cirrhosis compared to those without, for both M (24.3 ± 16.5 vs. 25.3 ± 15.8; p = 0.44) and XL (22.9 ± 14.0 vs. 22.2 ± 15.9; p = 0.68) probes.

Among the 139 patients with LSM <13 kPa – at lower risk of liver damage – the diagnosis of cirrhosis was made by histology in 53.2%, and based on LSM values12,13 in the remaining 65 patients.

PARAGRAPH

Three-hundred fourteen patients had LSM by both M and XL probes, and this cohort was considered as the training set.

In this cohort, LSM by M probe was significantly higher than that by XL probe (24.2 ± 14.7 vs. 19.8 ± 14.2; p <0.001).

Three-hundred thirty-eight and 138 patients had LSM by only M and XL probe, respectively, and these cohorts were considered as validation sets.

When considering patients with LSM by M probe, those in the training cohort had similar LSM (24.2 ± 14.7 kPa vs. 25.6 ± 17.2; p = 0.26) and PLT (176.5 ± 80.0 103/mm3 vs. 178.4 ± 98.1; p = 0.78) values and similar prevalence of VNT (10.2% vs. 13.3%; p = 0.21) compared to those in the validation cohort, while having a significantly higher prevalence of obesity (64.7% vs. 49.8%; p <0.001) and a significantly lower prevalence of any grade EV (26.4% vs. 36.3%; p = 0.006) (Table 1).

When looking at patients with LSM by XL probe, those in the training cohort had similar PLT values (176.5 ± 80.0 103/mm3 vs. 176.3 ± 81.6; p = 0.98) and similar prevalence of both any grade EV (26.4% vs. 29.7%; p = 0.47) and VNT (10.2% vs. 10.1%; p = 0.98) compared to those in the validation cohort, while having a significantly lower prevalence of obesity (64.7% vs. 88.5%; p <0.001) and significantly lower LSM values (19.8 ± 14.2 kPa vs. 27.7 ± 16.9; p <0.001) (Table 1).

Diagnostic accuracy of LSM and PLT for VNT

SECTION

Training set

PARAGRAPH

One hundred six out of 314 patients (33.8%) met Baveno VI criteria as a rule-out for VNT, of whom 11 (10.4%) had any grade EV and 1 patient (0.9%) had VNT (Table 2A).

When looking at expanded Baveno VI criteria 182 out of 314 patients (58%) met the criteria, of whom 30 (16.5%) had any grade EV and 7 patient (3.8%) had VNT (Table 2A).

Consistently, NPV for VNT was 99.1% and 96.2% for Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria, respectively (Table 2A).

PARAGRAPH

Furthermore, we tested new criteria specific for NAFLD-related cirrhosis –hereinafter called NAFLD cirrhosis criteria – and discriminated for M or XL probe.

We identified VNT, PLT >110,000 and LSM <30 kPa for M probe, and PLT >110,000 and LSM <25 kPa for XL probe as the best thresholds for rule-out.

The use of these thresholds enabled 68.5% and 65% of EGD to be spared, by missing 4.2% and 4.9% of VNT, and 17.7% and 18.1% of any grade EV, respectively (Table 2A and B).

NPV for VNT was 95.8% and 95.1% for patients with LSM by M or XL probe, respectively (Table 2A and B).

Consistent with these data, usage of NAFLD cirrhosis criteria in this cohort would have led 31.5% of patients to EGD screening (99 out of 314), which respectively represents 34.7% less EGDs than those required using Baveno VI criteria (208 out of 314), and 10.5% less EGDs than required using expanded Baveno VI criteria (132 out of 314).

SECTION

Validation set

PARAGRAPH

The diagnostic accuracy of Baveno VI, expanded Baveno VI and new NAFLD cirrhosis criteria was tested in the validation cohorts.

PARAGRAPH

In the validation cohort of 338 patients with LSM by only M probe, PLT >110,000 and LSM <30 kPa were confirmed as better than Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria in terms of spared endoscopy (61.8% vs. 33.4% vs. 54.1%) while keeping a similar rate of missed VNT (4.8% vs. 4.4% vs. 4.4%) and of missed any grade EV (22.5% vs. 18.6% vs. 21.3%), and a similar NPV (95.2%, 95.6% and 95.6%) (Table 2A).

Consistently, the number of EGDs needed with NAFLD cirrhosis criteria is 28.4% and 7.7% less than those needed using BAVENO VI and expanded BAVENO VI criteria, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

Finally, in the validation cohort of 138 patients with LSM by only XL probe – those where in clinical practice XL probe would be used because of failure of M probe – we confirmed the good diagnostic accuracy of PLT >110,000 and LSM <25 kPa in terms of spared endoscopy (46.4%), missed VNT (1.6%), missed any grade EV (17.2%), and NPV (98.4%) (Table 2B).

SECTION

Sensitivity analyses

PARAGRAPH

Sensitivity analyses performed in each center considered separately, confirmed that when considering LSM by M probe, the newly elaborated NAFLD cirrhosis criteria spared more EGD than Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria (range 50%–80.6% vs. 25%–52.8% vs. 41.7%–60%), while keeping a similar rate of missed VNT (range 0%–8.7% vs. 0%–12.5% vs. 0%–10%) and any grade EV (0%–38.6% vs. 0%–32.4% vs. 0%–41.3%) (Table S2).

Similar results were observed when considering the newly elaborated NAFLD cirrhosis criteria using XL probe (range 33.3%–70.3% for spared EGD; 0%–22.2% for missed VNT; 0%–66.7% for missed any grade EV) (Table S2).

PARAGRAPH

When considering the entire cohort of 652 patients with LSM by M probe – those where in clinical practice M probe would be used – Baveno VI, expanded Baveno VI and NAFLD cirrhosis criteria spared 33.6%, 56% and 65% of unnecessary EGD, respectively, by missing 2.7%, 4.1% and 4.5% of VNT, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

When excluding the 139 patients with LSM <13 kPa – at lower risk of liver disease severity – the prevalence of any grade EV and of VNT was 35.6% and 14.1%, respectively; 412 patients had LSM by M and 344 by XL probe.

In these patients NAFLD cirrhosis criteria spared 52.2% of unnecessary EGD by using M probe and 50.6% by using XL probe, also showing a similarly good rate of missed VNT (5.6% and 4.6%, respectively) and missed any grade EV (23.3% and 20.1%, respectively).

Notably, in the subgroup of patients with LSM by M probe, NAFLD cirrhosis criteria worked better than Baveno VI (18.7% spared EGD, 2.6% missed VNT and 14.3% missed any grade EV) and expanded Baveno VI (39.6% spared EGD, 4.9% missed VNT and 21.5% missed any grade EV) criteria.

PARAGRAPH

Finally, when splitting the entire population according to obesity, 110 non-obese and 202 obese patients had LSM by both M and XL probe.

In the obese group, NAFLD cirrhosis criteria spared 73.8% of unnecessary EGD by using M probe and 70.8% by using XL probe, also showing a similarly good rate of missed VNT (1.3% and 2.8%, respectively) and missed any grade EV (15.4% for both) (Table 3).

Notably, when looking at the group of non-obese patients, while NAFLD cirrhosis criteria by M or XL probes showed a similar performance, their accuracy was worse than that observed in obese patients.

Specifically, in non-obese patients, NAFLD cirrhosis criteria spared 59.1% of unnecessary EGD by using M probe and 54.5% by using XL probe, providing a rate of missed VNT of 10.8% and 10.5%, respectively, and missed any grade EV of 23.1% and 25%, respectively (Table 3).

To strength the robustness of these results, we analyzed separately patients with clinical or histological diagnosis of NAFLD cirrhosis.

Notably the worse performance of NAFLD cirrhosis criteria was confirmed in both groups.

Specifically, in non-obese patients with histological (n = 34) or clinical (n = 76) diagnosis of NAFLD cirrhosis the rate of missed VNT was 10.5 and 11.1% for the M probe, and 5.5% and 11.9% for the XL probe, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

Similar results were observed for both M and XL probe-based NAFLD cirrhosis criteria by splitting the entire cohort of patients with LSM, by M or XL probes, according to obesity (data not shown).

PARAGRAPH

The different accuracy of NAFLD cirrhosis criteria according to obesity was also confirmed for Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria, even if Baveno VI criteria kept a rate of missed VNT <5% sparing only 20% of EGD (Table 3).

Again, these results were confirmed in the entire cohorts of patients with LSM by M or XL probes, and in non-obese patients split for clinical or histological diagnosis of NAFLD cirrhosis (data not shown).

SECTION

Characteristics of patients with missed VNT or any grade EV

PARAGRAPH

In the entire cohort of 652 patients with LSM by M probe, NAFLD cirrhosis criteria missed 66 patients (15.5%) with small EV and 19 patients (4.4%) with VNT.

Notably, when considering patients fulfilling NAFLD cirrhosis criteria, those with missed VNT had a significantly lower prevalence of obesity compared to those without EV (26% vs. 61%; p = 0.007), and significantly lower PLT (174 ± 71 vs. 213 ± 82; p = 0.03) and higher LSM (20 ± 5.7 vs. 16.9 vs. 5.6; p = 0.02) values (Table 4A).

Similar results were observed for patients with missed small EV who had significantly lower PLT (182 ± 68 vs. 213 ± 82; p = 0.003) and higher LSM (18.5 ± 5.8 vs. 16.9 ± 5.6; p = 0.04) values compared to patients without EV (Table 4A).

PARAGRAPH

When looking at the 452 patients with LSM by XL probe, NAFLD cirrhosis criteria missed 37 patients (13.8%) with small EV and 11 patients (4.1%) with VNT.

Notably, among patients fulfilling NAFLD cirrhosis criteria, those with missed VNT when compared to those without EV had a significantly lower prevalence of obesity (46% vs. 78%; p = 0.03), and significantly lower PLT (146 ± 27 vs. 217 ± 77; p = 0.002) and higher LSM (16.4 ± 6.4 vs. 13.7 ± 5.0, p = 0.08) values (Table 4B).

Similar results were observed for patients with missed small EV who had significantly lower PLT (186 ± 63 vs. 217 ± 77, p = 0.02) and a trend for higher LSM (15.2 ± 5.6 vs. 13.7 ± 5.0, p = 0.09) values compared to those without EV (Table 4B).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this study on a large multicenter cohort of patients with NAFLD-related compensated cirrhosis we confirmed that expanded Baveno VI works better than Baveno VI criteria for ruling out the presence of VNT, sparing more EGD even if slightly increasing the number of missed VNT.

We also elaborated new more accurate criteria, optimized for M and XL FibroScan probes and always based on LSM and PLT values, that were able to spare more than 50% of unnecessary EGD.

PARAGRAPH

Portal hypertension significantly affects the natural history of liver cirrhosis of any etiology, including NAFLD.4

Along this line, the identification of EV by EGD or non-invasive tools is a key clinical need.

Baveno VI expert recommendations suggest avoiding EGD screening for VNT in patients with LSM <20 kPa and PLT >150,000 mm3,6 and expanded Baveno VI criteria have also been suggested.8

PARAGRAPH

In the present study, we found that Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria spared 33.8% and 58% of unnecessary EGD by missing 0.9% and 3.8% of VNT, respectively, these data being replicated in the validation cohort.

Firstly, our study validated Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria in the clinical setting of NAFLD-related cirrhosis, overall confirming that the updated criteria work better than the original Baveno VI, even if slightly increasing the number of missed VNT.

Notably, our data demonstrated a rate of spared EGD for Baveno VI criteria higher than the overall 20% reported in patients with cirrhosis due to viral and/or alcohol etiologies,7 also showing a higher rate of spared EGD for NAFLD by using the expanded Baveno VI criteria.8

These data confirmed the similar trend observed by Augustin and colleagues in a small cohort of 90 patients with NAFLD-related advanced chronic liver disease.8

This issue could be explained by the impact of viral infections and alcohol use on PLT values, and on hepatic inflammation.

PARAGRAPH

Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria were proposed and extensively validated in patients with cirrhosis mostly due to viral infections and/or alcohol abuse, and by considering LSM values obtained only by using the M probe.

For these reasons, we tested new criteria directly elaborated in NAFLD-related cirrhosis and differentiated for M and XL probes.

Notably, while keeping 110,000/mm3 as the best threshold for PLT, we identified that 30 kPa for M probe and 25 kPa for XL probe (the same threshold of LSM applied in the expanded Baveno VI criteria for M probe) were the best LSM thresholds, finally generating the new NAFLD cirrhosis criteria.

When considering the use of M probe, the NAFLD cirrhosis criteria performed better than Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI enabling 68.5% of unnecessary EGD to be spared, while keeping a similar rate of missed VNT, and replicating these results in the validation cohort.

The better accuracy of a higher threshold of LSM compared to that of the expanded Baveno VI could be related to the fact that the LSM in patients with NAFLD is directly related not only to fibrosis and, probably, portal hypertension, but also to severity of steatosis,9 obesity10 and higher skin-to-capsule length,15 all factors frequently observed in patients with NAFLD.

Furthermore, NAFLD cirrhosis criteria with modified LSM threshold for XL probe showed a similar and good diagnostic accuracy for ruling out patients with VNT.

These criteria used a lower LSM value compared to that used for the M probe.

This is not surprising, because, as observed for fibrosis13 in the setting of cirrhotic patients, LSM values obtained using an XL probe were significantly lower than those obtained by using the standard M probe.

Notably, the good and better – with respect to Baveno and Baveno VI – accuracy of NAFLD cirrhosis criteria for avoiding unnecessary EGD while keeping an acceptable rate of missed VNT, was largely validated in the higher risk cohort of patients with LSM ≥13 kPa and in all participating cohorts considered separately.

However, some of these analyses were limited by the small sample size.

PARAGRAPH

In the present study we found a higher prevalence of VNT in non-obese compared to obese patients.

This data, even if all included patients had compensated Child A cirrhosis, could suggest that non-obese patients, indicative of sarcopenia, had a more advanced disease – more severe portal hypertension, lower liver function, etc. – unfortunately not measurable by Child Classification.

Notably, from a diagnostic point of view, when splitting the population according to obesity, we confirmed that both M and XL probe-based NAFLD cirrhosis criteria had a similar diagnostic accuracy in obese and non-obese patients.

However, we also observed that these criteria – as also reported for expanded Baveno VI – had a worse performance in non-obese patients where the rate of missed VNT was of about 10%.

This picture was further confirmed by the evidence that BMI was significantly lower in patients with missed VNT compared to those without EV who fulfilled NAFLD cirrhosis criteria.

Differences in skin-to-capsule distance and/or steatosis severity between obese and non-obese patients could explain discrepancies in the observed diagnostic performances.

From a clinical point of view, these data, even if worthy of further validation, suggest careful interpretation of non-invasive scores for ruling out VNT in non-obese patients with NAFLD-related cirrhosis, where Baveno VI criteria seems to be more conservative even if sparing only 20% of EGD.

Anyway, the lack of a complete understanding of this phenomenon means that caution is required when interpreting this result.

PARAGRAPH

Another issue from the present study is that by applying Baveno VI, expanded Baveno VI and NAFLD cirrhosis criteria, designed to rule-out VNT, we missed about 10%–15% of patients with EV not needing treatment.

This data is clinically relevant because the presence of EV significantly affects the prognosis of cirrhotic patients via a higher risk of liver decompensation and death4,5 Notably, when looking at M or XL probe-based NAFLD cirrhosis criteria, patients with missed EV not needing treatment had significantly higher LSM and lower PLT values than patients without EV and considered not worthy of EGD.

These data potentially suggest that some of these patients when retested at one year, as suggested by Baveno VI recommendations, could be considered worthy of EGD screening.

PARAGRAPH

This study has some limitations.

First, the analysis of the data was retrospective and the evaluation of EV size has been performed by several endoscopists, not testing interobserver agreement.

In addition, lack of data about gastric varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy could further affect the interpretation of our results.

However, the same issues were present in other multicenter large studies assessing non-invasive prediction of VNT in cirrhosis,8 and both prevalence of VNT and performance of tested scores was similar among centers.

Second, interobserver concordance of LSM examinations was also not assessed, which could potentially affect the interpretation of our results.

However, all tests were performed by expert operators following the same protocol and fulfilling validity criteria.

Moreover, different relevant studies assessing FibroScan in NAFLD were based on multicenter cohorts and/or on multiple operators.12,13

Finally, many different studies reported good interobserver concordance for LSM and controlled attenuation parameter.16,17

Another limitation of our study lies in the fact that we cannot rule-out that some patients with reliable LSM by M probe could have a skin-to-capsule distance >2.5 cm, this issue potentially affecting the accuracy of our results.

The maximum six-month interval between LSM and EGD could further bias our results.

A strength of our paper is the availability of both M and XL FibroScan probes in a large population of patients with NAFLD.

Next generation FibroScan devices directly drive the use of M and XL probe and devices under development will adjust LSM values, eliminating differences related to probes.

However, available devices will be still used for many years so we are confident that our study adds relevant insights in this topic.

A further methodological issue is the potentially limited external validity of the results for different populations and settings.

Our study included a cohort of NAFLD-related compensated cirrhotic subjects, largely obese, who were referred to tertiary centers for liver disease, limiting the applicability of the results in different populations, and especially in Asiatic populations largely under-represented in this study.

Finally, lack of follow-up data may limit the potency of our results.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, we demonstrated that, in a large cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis due to NAFLD, the newly elaborated NAFLD cirrhosis criteria can safely spare more than 50% of unnecessary EGDs, working better than the previously proposed Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria.

Prospective studies are needed to further validate our results.
