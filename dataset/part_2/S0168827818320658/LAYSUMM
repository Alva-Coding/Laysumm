TITLE

Non-invasive prediction of esophageal varices by stiffness and platelet in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease cirrhosis

PARAGRAPH

In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-related compensated cirrhosis, the expanded Baveno VI criteria work better than the Baveno VI criteria for ruling out the presence of varices needing treatment, sparing unnecessary and invasive screening procedures.

New diagnostic criteria for this patient group, based on liver stiffness measurement and platelet count, and optimized for the specific FibroScanÂ® probe used, work better than both Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria.

The accuracy of all non-invasive scoring criteria was lower in non-obese patients.
