TITLE

Comparison of the accuracy of AASLD and LI-RADS criteria for the non-invasive diagnosis of HCC smaller than 3 cm

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most frequent cancer and the second leading cause of death from cancer worldwide, occurring on cirrhosis in over 90% of cases.1,2

Early detection is the only hope for effective and curative treatment of patients with HCC, emphasizing the crucial role of screening strategies in the monitoring of high-risk patients.

Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging play a key role in the diagnostic strategy of HCC, and an imaged-based diagnosis of HCC is accepted by several guidelines in Europe, North America and Asia, based on the unique vascular profile of this tumor.2–6

In fact, in nodules measuring >10 mm, the combination of hyperenhancement during the arterial phase followed by washout during the portal venous and/or delayed phases has been shown to have a specificity for HCC of nearly 100%, but the sensitivity and specificity is influenced by the size of the tumors.7,8

PARAGRAPH

Nevertheless, the inter-observer variability of these imaging criteria can vary according to the radiologist’s experience, the local medical culture and differences in interpretation.9

Recently, the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS®) was developed by the American College of Radiology to standardize terminology and criteria for interpreting and reporting CT and MR imaging results of the liver in patients at risk of HCC.

The initial version of LI-RADS first appeared online in 2011 and has been updated several times.10

The aim of LI-RADS is to help radiologists categorize findings in at-risk populations and to assist referring physicians in understanding the reports of liver imaging.

Observations are categorized from LR-1 (definitely benign) to LR-5 (definitely HCC).

LI-RADS includes major and ancillary criteria.

The former includes lesion size (10 to 19 mm and ≥20 mm), enhancement on multiphasic contrast-enhanced imaging including arterial, portal venous, and/or delayed phases, the presence of a capsule, and growth over six months.

The latter are ancillary features that can result in the upgrade or downgrade of the category.

The relative weight of each feature remains unknown.

PARAGRAPH

Studies have shown that LR-5 is highly specific for the diagnosis of small-sized HCC.11,12

Results are more controversial with LR-4 because some studies11,12 have shown a similar specificity with LR-5, while others have found a much lower specificity.13

Furthermore, up to 17%–29% of LR-4 diagnoses are downgraded into lower Li-RADS categories.14,15

How radiologists should use LI-RADS instead of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) criteria for the diagnosis of HCC in high-risk populations has still not been determined.

Although a few studies have assessed or compared the diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility of LI-RADS to other standardized systems for the diagnosis of HCC by imaging,9,12,13,16,17 data comparing LI-RADS to AASLD criteria are scarce.11

These studies are mainly single center and retrospective, and CT and MR imaging have rarely been compared.

PARAGRAPH

Thus, the goals of this prospective study were to compare the diagnostic accuracy of AASLD and LI-RADS for the non-invasive diagnosis of small HCC using CT and MR imaging, and to evaluate the diagnostic value of each ancillary feature of HCC found in LI-RADS.

SECTION

Materials and methods

PARAGRAPH

This is an ancillary study based on data from a multicenter prospective study registered on clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00848952.18

The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by an independent review board, and all patients received oral and written information, and provided informed consent before enrollment in the study.

SECTION

Patient inclusion and study design

PARAGRAPH

From April 2009 to April 2012, patients were prospectively enrolled from 16 tertiary university hospitals.

Inclusion criteria were: i) age >18 years old, ii) Child-Pugh class A or B cirrhosis proven either by pathology or with a combination of ultrasound elastography and laboratory tests, and iii) up to three focal liver lesion(s) between 10 and 30 mm in diameter identified on ultrasound or CT or MR imaging in patients under surveillance.

Patients with a history of HCC treated by surgery or tumor ablation could be included, but only new nodules at a distance of >2 cm from previously treated lesions were considered.

Non-inclusion criteria were: i) patients with a history of chemoembolization, ii) patients with a least one nodule >3 cm, and iii) any patient with a contraindication to CT or MR imaging, or a contraindication to intravenous injection of ultrasound, iodinated or gadolinium-based contrast agents.

PARAGRAPH

Patients underwent contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), CT and MR imaging within one month after inclusion.

In the present study, we focused on CT and MR imaging features, thus nodules visible only on CEUS were excluded.

Demographics, clinical and biological data were noted.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 684 nodules were detected in 442 patients during the study period.

Eighty-nine of these (13%) were excluded from the final analysis for the following reasons: 71 because they were <10 mm or >30 mm, five because a definitive diagnosis could not be reached and 13 because they were only seen on CEUS.

PARAGRAPH

Thus, the final study group included 422 patients (343 male, 81%) and 595 nodules (Fig. 1).

SECTION

Imaging protocols

SECTION

CT imaging

PARAGRAPH

All CT examinations were performed with a variety of multidetector cardiac CT (MDCT) devices (16 and 64 MDCT scanners).

Acquisition protocols varied according to the different centers, with a reconstruction thickness from 0.625 to 3 mm.

All CT examinations included four phases extending from the diaphragm to the iliac crest or the lower part of the right liver: an unenhanced phase, late hepatic arterial (30 to 35 s), portal venous (70 to 90 s) and delayed (3 min) phases.

A total of 1.5 to 2 ml/kg of iodine contrast media, with an iodine concentration of 350 g/L was injected with a power injector at a rate of 3–4 ml/s without exceeding 150 ml.

SECTION

MR imaging

PARAGRAPH

MR imaging examinations of the liver were performed using 1.5 T magnets in 11 centers, 3 T magnets in two centers, and either 1.5 or 3 T magnets in three centers.

All examinations were performed with a phased-array torso coil.

The MR imaging protocol systematically included the following: a respiratory-triggered fat-suppressed fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequence, an in- and opposed-phase gradient-echo T1-weighted sequence, a diffusion-weighted sequence with a b value of >400 s/mm2, a fat-suppressed 3D gradient-echo T1 weighted sequence, before and after intravenous injection of extracellular gadolinium chelates, obtained at the arterial (bolus triggering), portal (70 s), and delayed (3 min) phases.

Contrast agent and saline were injected with a power injector at a rate of 2 ml/s.

SECTION

Image analysis

SECTION

Imaging features and nodule classification

PARAGRAPH

CT and MR imaging analysis was performed in each center by senior abdominal radiologists.

Each reader was blinded to the other imaging results and any clinical information, but was aware of the presence of a chronic liver disease.

The following items were noted for each CT or MR imaging examination: i) size and location according to the Couinaud classification, ii) signal intensity or attenuation on unenhanced, late arterial, portal venous, and delayed phase images.

Lesions were compared to the liver parenchyma for signal intensity or attenuation.

“Hypervascularization” was defined as hyperenhancement during arterial phase images.

“Wash out” or “wash out appearance” was defined as nodules showing portal/delayed hyposignal/attenuation, iii) the presence of a capsule, defined as peripheral rim enhancement on portal venous or delayed phase images, and iv) the presence of venous tumor invasion.

PARAGRAPH

Both AASLD and LI-RADS (v.2014) criteria were applied to each nodule on both imaging modalities.

Nodules were diagnosed as HCC by AASLD criteria when they displayed a specific vascular profile (hyperenhancement during the arterial phase and washout during portal venous and/or delayed phases).

Nodules were classified as LR-1 to LR-5 by LI-RADS criteria.

For hypervascular nodules ranging from 10 to 19 mm, LR-5 included the LR-5us category if nodules showed “washout” and were visible as discrete nodules at antecedent surveillance ultrasound.

The growth threshold was excluded from the analysis.

This choice was made to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the scores (AASLD and LI-RADS v.2014) at a given time point in a population of patients at risk of developing HCC.

The LR-M category (i.e. probable malignancy, not specific to HCC) was not considered because this category is not included in the AASLD criteria.

SECTION

LI-RADS ancillary features

PARAGRAPH

Readers also analyzed ancillary features used and defined in LI-RADS on CT and MR imaging.

A senior resident and a senior radiologist retrospectively reviewed all CT and MR imaging results of nodules classified as LR-3 by consensus.

In the LI-RADS system, ancillary features are not used to automatically upgrade an LR-3 nodule to LR-4, but should be used at the judgement of the radiologist.

Importantly, the ancillary features cannot upgrade a lesion to LR-5.

Yet, the relative weight of each feature remains unknown.

In order to evaluate the weight of these features, we arbitrarily chose to upgrade LR-3 nodules to LR-4 in the presence of at least one ancillary sign suggesting HCC.19

Readers analyzed the following features on MR imaging: mild-moderate T2 signal hyperintensity, hypersignal on diffusion-weighted images with at least moderate diffusion weighting (e.g. b ≥400 s/mm2), a distinctive rim (as discrete perilesional rim), corona enhancement, mosaic architecture, intra-lesional fat, lesional iron sparing, lesional fat sparing, blood products.18

Only the six latter criteria were also assessed on CT images.

The ancillary features were not applied to LR-1 or LR-2 nodules.

SECTION

Final diagnosis

PARAGRAPH

A composite step-by-step algorithm was defined to obtain the reference standard.

PARAGRAPH

The goal of this algorithm was to diagnose “HCC nodules” from “non-HCC nodules”.

PARAGRAPH

First, the diagnosis of HCC was histologically confirmed (by either pathological examination of liver resection, liver transplantation, or biopsy).

Positive histology for HCC was only taken into consideration if it was performed within six months after the last imaging examination.

If the positive diagnosis of HCC was not obtained by histology, a nodule displaying the typical imaging hallmarks of HCC2,3 on both CT and MR imaging was considered to be HCC, as the combination of two imaging results has a specificity of nearly 100%.4,8

If the nodule was solitary, larger than 20 mm and atypical either on CT and/or MRI (even if typical on one imaging modality), an alpha-fetoprotein serum level >200 ng/ml was considered a positive diagnosis of HCC.

Finally, if a positive diagnosis of HCC could not be obtained, the following modifications were considered diagnostic for HCC within six months after the imaging: increase in size (>30%) or a change in the enhancement pattern (hypervascularization in a previously non-hypervascular nodule or washout in a nodule with initial arterial hypervascularization but without washout).

The six-month interval was chosen because it corresponds to the estimated doubling time of HCCs.

Remaining nodules were considered non-HCCs following these different steps.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Continuous variables are presented as means and standard deviations.

When not normally distributed, continuous variables are expressed as medians and interquartile range.

Categorical variables are presented as numbers and percentages.

PARAGRAPH

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of AASLD criteria, the diagnosis of HCC was confirmed when the nodule displayed the specific vascular profile on one imaging modality (i.e. CT or MR imaging).

For LI-RADS, the percentage of HCC in each category (i.e. LR-1 to LR-2, LR-3, LR-4, LR-5 and LR-5V) was calculated for both imaging techniques.

The diagnostic accuracy of the following combinations of categories was assessed: LR-5V, LR-5 + LR-5V, LR-4 + LR-5 + LR-5V.

Diagnostic performances between criteria were compared using the McNemar test.

PARAGRAPH

Given that imaging could be a part of the final diagnosis algorithm, the study design may lead to an incorporation bias.

Therefore, analyses were also performed in nodules that underwent resection.

PARAGRAPH

To assess the added value of each ancillary feature, we decided to recategorize any LR-3 nodule with a given ancillary feature as LR-4.

Therefore, we evaluated the accuracy of the different LR-5V + LR-5 + LR-4 + LR-3/ancillary combinations, in which “ancillary” stood for any of the ancillary features taken separately.

Sensitivity and specificity were calculated respectively, as the proportion of HCCs and non-HCCs that were correctly identified with the different imaging criteria.

We obtained exact 95% CIs for sensitivity and specificity from the binomial distribution.

Positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV), and likelihood ratios (LR) were calculated with their 95% CIs.

P <0.05 was considered significant.

PARAGRAPH

SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Inc.

Cary, North Carolina,) was used for all statistical analysis.

Results

SECTION

Patients and tumors

PARAGRAPH

Demographics, clinical and biological characteristics of the patients are summarized (Table 1).

All observations were made for cirrhosis from two main etiologies: excess alcohol consumption (58%) and chronic hepatitis C (31%).

A total of 595 nodules were included, 559 (94%) identified on MR imaging, 529 (89%) on CT and 493 (83%) on both.

The mean number of nodules per patient was 1.4 and nodules were a mean 18 ± 6 mm large.

Forty-two (7%) and 211 (35%) nodules were resected and had biopsy, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

The diagnosis of HCC was confirmed in 342 (61.2%) nodules visualized by MR imaging, and 332 (62.8%) visualized by CT, with 180 (51.6%) and 176 (53.5%) HCCs in the 10–19 mm group, and 162 (77.1%) and 156 (78%) HCCs in the 20–30 mm group, respectively.

The remaining 217 (38.8%) and 197 (37.2%) lesions were defined as non–HCCs.

Final diagnosis of pathologically proven non–HCC nodules is provided (Table S1).

Sixty-seven patients had both HCC and non-HCC nodules.

Ten HCCs (<3%) were diagnosed by mean of change on six-month follow-up imaging (including three for a mean growth of 70%, and seven for changes in enhancement).

SECTION

Diagnostic accuracy of AASLD criteria

PARAGRAPH

The diagnostic accuracy of AASLD criteria for the diagnosis of HCC with each imaging modality is summarized (Tables 2 and 3).

The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 72.5%, 87.6%, 90.2%, and 66.9%, respectively for MR imaging, and 71.4%, 77.7%, 84.3%, 61.7% for CT.

The specificity increased while the sensitivity did not significantly change in 20–30 mm nodules compared to 10–19 mm nodules: from 84.6% and 72.2% to 97.9% and 72.8% on MR imaging, and from 73.2% and 71% to 93.2% and 71.8% on CT, respectively.

SECTION

Diagnostic accuracy of LI-RADS classification

PARAGRAPH

The diagnostic accuracy of the LI-RADS criteria for the diagnosis of HCC for each imaging modality is summarized (Tables 2 and 3).

Results for nodules that underwent resection or not are presented (Tables S2 and S3).

Results for primary nodules and for recurrent nodules are presented (Tables S4 and S5).

PARAGRAPH

A total of 61 (12%) and 61 (11%), 116 (21%) and 133 (24%), 98 (19%) and 95 (17%), 243 (46%) and 264 (47%) and 11 (2%) and 6 (1%) nodules were classified as LR-1 or 2, LR-3, LR-4, LR-5 and LR-5V on CT and MR imaging, respectively.

Among the LR-5 nodules, 57 nodules on MR imaging and 97 nodules on CT were classified as LR-5us.

Among the LR-4 nodules, 28 (29%) and 17 (18%) showed both hypervascularity and washout on CT and MR imaging, respectively, while other nodules showed either no hypervascularity or no washout.

PARAGRAPH

No (0%) LR1 and LR2, 44 (33%) and 47 (41%) LR3, 50 (53%) and 54 (55%) LR4, 244 (94%) and 222 (91%) LR5 and 4 (67%) and 9 (82%) LR5V were HCC on MR imaging and CT, respectively.

The percentage of HCC was significantly different in the various LI-RADS categories with both CT (p <0.0001), and MR imaging (p <0.0001), and increased from 41% for LR-3 (Fig. 2) to 91% for LR-5/LR-5V for CT and from 33% for LR-3 to 92% for LR-5/ LR-5V on MR imaging (Tables 2, 3 and 4, Fig. 2).

The size of the lesions (HCC and non-HCC combined) increased significantly from LR-3 to LR-5 for both CT and MR imaging (p <0.001) (Table S6).

PARAGRAPH

The sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of HCC varied according to the LI-RADS categories.

The highest sensitivity was observed with the combination of LR-3, LR-4, LR-5 and LR-5V on CT and/or MR imaging, while the highest specificity was observed with LR-5V alone and with the LR-5V and LR-5 combination on CT and/or MR imaging.

PARAGRAPH

When LR-4 nodules were added to LR-5 and LR-5V nodules, the sensitivity increased for both modalities (from 72.5% and 87.1% for MR imaging and from 69.6% to 85.8% for CT), but the specificity decreased (from 89.9% to 69.1% for MR imaging and from 88.3% to 66% for CT) (Fig. 3).

PARAGRAPH

There was disagreement in the LI-RADS category between CT and MR imaging in 152 nodules out of 493 nodules visualized on both MR imaging and CT (31%).

The details on these nodules are presented (Table S7).

SECTION

Comparison between AASLD and LI-RADS

PARAGRAPH

Comparison between AASLD and LI-RADS criteria is provided (Tables 1 and 2).

For the entire cohort of nodules explored by MR imaging, the sensitivity and specificity of AASLD and the combination of LR-5 + LR-5V were not statistically different (p = 1.0, and p = 0.18, respectively).

Yet, for nodules smaller than 20 mm, this LI-RADS combination offered lower sensitivity (p = 0.002) but higher specificity (p = 0.02) than the AASLD criteria.

The sensitivity of the combination of LR-5 + LR-5 + LR-4 was significantly higher than that of AASLD for all tumor sizes (p = 0.008 to p <0.001), but its specificity was significantly lower (p <0.001).

PARAGRAPH

For nodules explored by CT, the sensitivity of the combination of LR-5 + LR-5V was not statistically different for that of the AASLD for the entire cohort (p = 0.24) but it was smaller for nodules smaller than 20 mm (p <0.001).

Its specificity was higher for all nodules and those smaller than 20 mm (p <0.001).

The sensitivity of the combination of LR-5 + LR-5 + LR-4 was significantly higher than that of AASLD for all tumor sizes (p = 0.045 to p <0.001), but its specificity was lower in the entire cohort and in nodules larger than 20 mm (p <0.001 for both).

SECTION

Ancillary features of LR-3 nodules [H2]

PARAGRAPH

The main characteristics of LR-3 nodules are summarized (Table 5).

Most nodules classified as LR-3 were between 10 and 19 mm (125 [94%] on MR imaging and 112 [97%] on CT).

Hypervascularity was observed in 88 nodules (66%) on MR imaging and 63 nodules (54%) on CT (p = 0.223 and p = 0.565).

The presence of washout was observed in 18 nodules (14%) on MR imaging and 44 nodules (37%) on CT (p = 0.056 and p = 0.121).

A capsule was only noted in one nodule (1%) on MR imaging and none on CT.

PARAGRAPH

The frequency of the different ancillary features suggesting HCC varied.

The three most frequent features on MR imaging were a mild to moderate hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images (46%), hypersignal on diffusion-weighted imaging (32%), and intra-lesional fat (12%).

On CT, intra-lesional fat (40%), lesional fat sparing (20%) and mosaic architecture (9%) were the most frequent images.

Only a mild to moderate hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images was significantly more frequent in HCC than in non–HCC lesions (52% vs. 48%; p <0.001).

PARAGRAPH

When LR-3 nodules were recategorized as LR-4 based on the presence of ancillary features, the diagnostic accuracy depended upon the ancillary features taken into account (Tables S8 and S9) with the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of HCC ranging from 87.1% to 96.5% and 55.8% to 67.7%, on MR imaging, respectively, and from 86.4% to 92.5% and from 53.1% to 65.5%, on CT respectively.

When recategorizing LR-3 to LR-4 based on the presence of at least one ancillary feature, sensitivity increased from 87.1% to 97.1% and specificity decreased from 69.1% to 51.2% on MR imaging.

On CT, sensitivity increased from 85.8% to 95.2% and specificity decreased from 66% to 44.2%.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this prospective multicenter study including 422 patients with cirrhosis with more than 500 small-sized nodules, the diagnostic accuracy of LI-RADS was not better than the AASLD criteria for the non-invasive diagnosis of small HCC on MRI or CT.

PARAGRAPH

The goal of LI-RADS was not only to increase the consistency of categorizing liver results, but also to potentially increase the diagnostic accuracy for HCC with additional criteria.

The present study confirms the high specificity of LR-5/LR-5V for HCC, but with a sensitivity that is much lower than that of AASLD criteria, particularly in 10–20 mm nodules with CT and MR imaging.

Our results are similar to those by Darnell et al. who reported a high specificity (98.2%) and a low sensitivity (42.3%) of the LR-5 category in a population of 133 nodules ≤20 mm.11

Choi et al. also reported an excellent PPV for the LR-5 category.13

PARAGRAPH

Indeed, combining the LR-4 and LR-5/ LR-5V categories for the diagnosis of HCC markedly increased the sensitivity of both CT and MR imaging, but resulted in an unacceptably low specificity.

These results can be explained by the fact that one-third of the LR-4 results were non-HCC lesions in our series.

The combination of both categories (LR-4 and LR-5/ LR-5V) to diagnose HCC is controversial in the literature.

For some authors, there was a marked increase in sensitivity with no loss in specificity (98.2% to 96.4%)11,12 while for others the rate of false positive lesions (LR-4 observations that were confirmed as being non-HCC nodules) ranged from 18% to 20.9%.13

Our results are similar to the latter and we strongly believe that the LR-4 and LR-5 categories should not be combined for the diagnosis of HCC.

Interestingly, it has been shown that a minority of LR-4 observations progress to LR-5 while most remain stable and can even downgrade to LR-3 or LR-1.14,15

PARAGRAPH

In the current study, we also evaluated the diagnostic value of LR-3 observations with at least one ancillary finding, suggesting the presence of HCC “upgraded to LR-4”, as well as the diagnostic value of each ancillary finding.

Like results combining LR-4 with LR-5/LR-5V, the sensitivity of the combination of LR-3 upgraded to LR-4 and LR-5/LR-5V was excellent while specificity was poor (24.8%).

None of the ancillary findings were observed significantly more often in HCC than in non-HCC nodules, except mild-moderate hyperintense T2-weighted images.

However, this finding was frequently seen in non-HCC nodules.

Thus, it cannot reliably discriminate nodules in chronic liver diseases.

The LR-3 category does seem to be a reliable entity.

In our series, the proportion of HCC was 33% and 41% on CT and MR imaging, respectively, while the proportion of HCC in LR-3 observations varies from 9% to 69% in literature.11,16

These differences may be due to the study design (retrospective or prospective), the size of the study population, and lesion size.

In the article reported by Ehman et al., only a few lesions were smaller than 20 mm, while nearly all of our LR-3 results were smaller than 20 mm.

Thus, although the 2014 version of the LI-RADS seems to provide a fair indication of the probability of HCC for a given nodule, it cannot be applied in routine practice like the BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System),20 which is used to rank breast abnormalities on imaging.

BI-RADS lesions classified as ACR3, which is the equivalent of LR-3, have <2% probability of malignancy.21–23

Therefore, how can the LI-RADS be used in the diagnostic algorithm of nodules for chronic liver diseases?

First, for the diagnosis of HCC (LR-5) and the diagnosis of non-HCC nodules (LR-1 and 2).

Second, it can also probably be used to adapt patient management in LR-4 and LR-3 categories including a more aggressive approach and extensive indications for liver biopsy in patients with ancillary findings that favor HCC.

Indeed, this strategy should be validated on a large scale.

PARAGRAPH

Discrepant LI-RADS categories were identified in more than 30% of the nodules analyzed by both imaging modalities.

These discrepancies are well known and can even reach 77%.24

We also showed that MR imaging was better than CT for the diagnosis of HCC, which has also been found in several studies that reported improved visualization of arterial hyperenhancement of small HCCs,25 and greater accuracy for detecting the peripheral capsule.26

Thus, the accuracy of a combination of CT and MRI is better than with either imaging modality alone, mainly by increasing the positive predictive value of HCC in nodules showing consistent classification with both modalities.

These results show that these two imaging modalities may be combined to assess the smallest nodules (10–20 mm), as suggested by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)-European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer guidelines2 and the studies by Forner et al. and Khalilli et al.27,28 Yet, a recent study from Aubé et al. showed that this combination resulted in a very low sensitivity.18

PARAGRAPH

This study has several limitations.

Firstly, MR imaging examinations were performed with an extracellular gadolinium contrast agent, so we could not assess two ancillary features: hepatobiliary phase hypointensity and transitional phase hypointensity.

Nevertheless, the study was performed according to Western guidelines,2,3 which do not recommend the use of first-line hepatospecific MR contrast agents.

In a recent letter, Forner et al. emphasized the need for further large prospective studies to confirm the superiority of hepatobiliary contrast agents for the diagnosis of small HCC.4

Secondly, the growth threshold, one of the major LI-RADS criteria, was excluded from the analysis.

This choice was made to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the two scores (AASLD and LI-RADS) at a given point in time in a population of patients at risk of developing HCC.

However, although the growth threshold is regarded as one of the main diagnostic criteria, its diagnostic value seems to be low13 and follow-up of high-risk patients with nodules >10 mm does not correspond to existing international guidelines.2,3

Thirdly, we did not include the LR-M category (i.e. probable malignancy, not specific of HCC) because the primary endpoint was the comparison with the AASLD criteria, and this category does not exist in these criteria.

Finally, the reference standard for the final diagnosis of HCC is composite and not based on a histologic diagnosis alone.

Nevertheless, this reference standard is clinically relevant, and we followed EASL guidelines for nodules between 10 and 20 mm (i.e. a combination of contrast-enhanced CT and MR imaging), which have the highest reported specificity.2

Moreover, in a significant portion of HCCs, the diagnosis was obtained by histology.

Considering only an absolute reference (as surgical resection) would have introduced more bias.

Histology and follow-up is the classical gold standard, but this also has limitations particularly negative biopsy caused by sampling error or mistargeting.

Furthermore, follow-up does not always solve the problem, because histology of the nodule at the time of imaging may not be ascertained.

Instead, the composite reference method we built was a step-by-step process considering only an absolute specificity of the different diagnostic tests.

The similar diagnostic performance of imaging, using surgical resection only as a reference compared to the whole population confirmed the appropriateness of our composite reference method.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, the 2014 version of the LI-RADS is no more accurate than the AASLD score for the non-invasive diagnosis of small HCC in high-risk patients, but it provides important information on the probability of having HCC in high-risk patients, allowing possible changes in management of these patients.
