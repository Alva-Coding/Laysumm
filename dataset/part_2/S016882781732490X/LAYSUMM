TITLE

Anti-HBV response to toll-like receptor 7 agonist GS-9620 is associated with intrahepatic aggregates of T cells and B cells

PARAGRAPH

New therapies to treat chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are urgently needed.

In this study we performed a retrospective analysis of liver and blood samples from a chimpanzee model of CHB to help understand how GS-9620, a drug in clinical trials, suppressed hepatitis B virus (HBV).

We found that the antiviral response to GS-9620 was associated with accumulation of immune cells in the liver that can either kill cells infected with HBV or can produce antibodies that may prevent HBV from infecting new liver cells.

These findings have important implications for how GS-9620 may be used in patients and may also help guide the development of new therapies to treat chronic HBV infection.
