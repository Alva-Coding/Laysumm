TITLE

Role of liver and spleen stiffness in predicting the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after resection

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a frequent complication in patients with chronic liver diseases, and one of the most common malignancies worldwide.1,2

Liver resection is the first option for the treatment of patients with small solitary tumors and preserved liver function.1,2

Tumor recurrence complicates 70% of cases of hepatic resection at 5 years, and is the expression of both intrahepatic metastasis (mainly stated as early recurrence) and the development of de novo tumors (late recurrence).3–8

PARAGRAPH

Some studies9–12 recently explored the differences between early and late recurrence and investigated the risk factors for each type of recurrence.

Predictive factors for early recurrence, i.e. recurrence within 24 months of surgery, are well established and are mainly tumor- or treatment-related (i.e. tumor size, tumor number, presence of microsatellites and vascular invasion).13

By contrast, only poor data are available for the prediction of late recurrence, i.e. recurrence 24 months post-surgery, which is probably related to the evolution of the underlying chronic liver disease.

Among the possible predictive factors for late HCC recurrence, the presence and the degree of portal hypertension (PH) could play an important role.

In fact clinically significant PH influences the natural history of advanced liver disease, as the degree of PH is directly correlated with the risk of developing complications,14 including HCC.15

PARAGRAPH

The measurement of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is the gold standard method used to assess PH, which stratifies the severity and prognosis of patients with chronic liver diseases.

HVPG >10 mmHg has been identified as an independent predictive factor for HCC development.15

However HVPG is invasive, thus in the last decade, several authors16,17 have tried to assess PH with non-invasive methods.

In particular, the role of liver16 and spleen stiffness18–20 (LS and SS) have been investigated as non-invasive markers of PH and its complications.

In addition, our research group also identified spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) as a predictor of clinical complications in patients with compensated cirrhosis, including HCC.19

PARAGRAPH

The investigation of the degree of both liver fibrosis and PH with non-invasive tests could thus identify patients at risk of recurrence after resection.

In fact, 2 recent studies correlated the degree of pre-resection LS, a marker of liver fibrosis and PH, with the late recurrence of HCC.21,22

PARAGRAPH

To the best of our knowledge, the role of SS as a predictor of HCC recurrence has not yet been investigated.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and SSM in the prediction of HCC recurrence after curative resection.

SECTION

Patients and methods

PARAGRAPH

Between October 2008 and January 2014, patients with a first HCC diagnosis who were suitable for curative hepatic resection according to American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) guidelines 200523 were prospectively and consecutively enrolled before surgery and followed up for at least 30 months after curative resection in order to identify HCC recurrence.

The study was carried out at the Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences of the S. Orsola Hospital, in Bologna, Italy and approved by the local Ethics Committee; informed consent was obtained from all patients.

PARAGRAPH

The inclusion criteria for the study were: patients with chronic liver disease and primary HCC suitable for hepatic resection.

Exclusion criteria were patients with HCC recurrence and patients who refused surgical treatment.

PARAGRAPH

HCC diagnosis was performed on the basis of clinical and/or histological and/or biochemical and/or radiological parameters, according to AASLD guidelines.23

HCC staging (mainly size and number) was performed according to imaging evaluations, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).23

PARAGRAPH

In brief, we judged patients suitable for surgery according to the most recent guidelines available when the study started,23 thus, we included patients with normal bilirubin concentration, and the absence of decompensated liver cirrhosis.

Neither LSM nor SSM were used for the selection of surgical candidates.

Ultrasound (US) was performed on all patients during surgery in order to detect any additional nodules that had not been revealed pre-operatively and to ascertain a tumor-free margin of at least 1 cm.

During parenchymal transection, clamping was always adopted to control bleeding; central venous pressure was maintained under 5–6 mmHg to prevent bleeding from hepatic veins.

SECTION

Liver and spleen stiffness measurements

PARAGRAPH

LSM and SSM were assessed by transient elastography within 1 week before surgery using a FibroScan® (Echosens, Paris, France) after an overnight fasting and a complete abdominal US examination before surgery.

LS values were obtained as previously reported18 and according to the Liver Stiffness Study Group “Elastica” of the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver24 and the recommendations of the European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB).25,26

For each patient, LS values were considered adequate if the success rate was >60%, and the interquartile range (IQR) was <30% of the median value.

PARAGRAPH

SSM was performed as previously described18,19 with the same probe used to perform LSM.

SS values were obtained, after overnight fasting and under US assistance.

The same guidelines for LS measurement were applied (i.e., success rate >60%, IQR <30%) to SS to consider the examination adequate.24

An LSM was always performed in the cirrhotic liver parenchyma, far from the HCC, using US as a guide.

SECTION

HCC recurrence diagnosis

PARAGRAPH

HCC recurrence was defined according to previous studies27,28 and the recent AASLD guidelines as early (if occurring <24 months) or late (if occurring >24 months).1

The follow-up protocol included a clinical assessment by physical examination, US and laboratory exams every 3 months.

HCC recurrence was diagnosed according to modifications of alpha-fetoprotein levels and US appearance, confirmed either by multiphasic CT or multiphasic MRI.23

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Continuous variables were reported as median (interquartile range [IQR] or 25th–75th percentiles), and categorical variables were reported as counts (percentage).

To identify factors associated with HCC recurrence, we considered the following variables: gender (male/female), age, body mass index (BMI), etiology (hepatitis C virus [HCV], hepatitis B virus [HBV], HCV-HBV vs. other causes such as alcohol or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH]), HCC grade tumor, HCC maximum diameter, HCC number of nodules (≤1 vs. >1), macrovascular invasion, microvascular invasion, histologic margins of the resection <1 cm, HCC satellitosis, localization of HCC on the right lobe/left lobe/both lobes, esophageal varices (EV), spleen length (<12 cm vs. ≥12 cm), platelet to spleen length ratio (<909 vs. ≥909), LSM and SSM assessed by FibroScan®.

As most of the patients would have been in Child-Pugh class A with a low model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, these 2 variables were not considered in univariate and multivariate analyses.

PARAGRAPH

We prospectively and consecutively enrolled all patients suitable for curative surgery.

Patients were followed for 24 months in order to detect early recurrences and then for at least further 6 months starting from the 24th month in order to detect late recurrences.

We performed 2 separate analyses: the first considering the first 24 months and the second a follow-up of at least a further 6 months.

We assumed that if a patient had an early recurrence, he/she could not have a late recurrence.

In order to identify the factors associated with early and late HCC recurrence, 2 separate analyses were performed.

First, considering all the participants enrolled, a Cox regression analysis was conducted to assess the ability of the above variables in predicting the risk of HCC recurrence in the first 24 months after the resection.

Second, considering only patients with at least 24 months of follow-up without early HCC recurrence, a similar Cox regression analysis was performed to assess the ability of the same variables to predict late HCC recurrence.

In order to define the meaning and possible use of our results in clinical practice, we selected a cut-off value that would optimize the prediction of late HCC recurrence.

According to this cut-off value, the included patients were divided into 2 sub-groups; then using the Kaplan-Meier approach the risk of late HCC recurrence was estimated and compared between the 2 sub-groups.

The log-rank test was used for these comparisons.

We planned to enroll about 25 patients/years and expected about a 60% recurrence rate in these patients.

PARAGRAPH

We performed 2 non-planned post hoc analyses: first, for conflicting results29,30 we decided to not include alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) as a predictor of early HCC recurrence in the initial study model; however, subsequently studies demonstrated a possible role for AFP.31,32

Thus, we tried to assess the role of AFP in predicting early HCC recurrence.

The available AFP values were rescaled (divided by 100) and introduced into the model.

Second, we noted that HCC late recurrence occurred mostly in patients with Metavir score F4; thus, we performed an analysis introducing Metavir score (F4 compared to score 1, 2, 3) for the prediction of late HCC recurrence.

PARAGRAPH

For both early and late recurrence analyses, the same statistical approach was used.

Firstly, several univariate Cox regression analyses were performed considering all the variables.

Subsequently, only the variables significantly associated with the recurrence in univariate analyses were entered into a multivariate model.

Finally, the best multivariate model was identified, adopting a backward elimination procedure.

Data were analyzed considering deaths and liver transplantations as competing events.

The estimated hazard ratios (HR) with their 95% CIs were calculated.

P values less than 0.05, (2-tailed), were considered statistically significant.

SAS statistical software (version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA.)

was used for the statistical analyses.

Results

SECTION

Patient characteristics

PARAGRAPH

Of the 175 enrolled patients, 18 were lost to follow-up.

The characteristics of the remaining 157 patients, followed up for at least 24 months from the inclusion or until HCC recurrence, is shown (Table 1).

Among the overall population, 64 out of 157 (40.8%) patients did not develop HCC recurrence, 66 out of 157 (42%) patients developed an early HCC recurrence within 24 months (16 after 12 months); 27 out of 157 (17.2%) patients developed late recurrence (after 24 months) (Fig. 1).

PARAGRAPH

Of the 157 patients evaluated, 1 patient who did not develop HCC recurrence underwent liver transplantation within 24 months from liver resection, 6 patients who did not develop HCC recurrence died (4 out of 6 for liver-related causes and 3 out of 6 died within 24 months of surgery) and finally 1 patient who developed late recurrence died due to liver-related causes.

PARAGRAPH

The majority of the enrolled population was male (87.9%) with a median age at diagnosis of 62 years.

The prevalent etiology at diagnosis was an HCV-related liver disease.

Of the enrolled population, 94.9% had a Child-Pugh score A. Of our population, 3.8% had stage F1 liver fibrosis on the biopsy specimen sampled during surgery, according to the Metavir classification,33 8.3% had stage F2, 31.2% had stage F3, and 56.7% had stage F4.

Seventy-two (45.9%) patients underwent atypical liver resection and 85 patients (54.1%) underwent anatomical resection.

All patients underwent an R0 resection with absence of tumor at the resection margin.

PARAGRAPH

Of the 157 enrolled patients, SSM was invalid in 15 patients (9.6%) and in 6 of them LSM was also invalid (3.8%).

In addition, among these 15 patients with invalid SSM, 9 patients developed early HCC recurrence and only 1 patient developed late HCC recurrence.

Of the 6 patients with invalid LSM, 4 patients developed early HCC recurrence and none of these 6 patients developed late HCC recurrence.

PARAGRAPH

The median length of follow-up in the patients without late recurrence was 1,871 days, and in patients with recurrences, it was 951 days.

The post-operative and 90-day mortality rate from surgery were zero.

SECTION

Risk factors for early (<24 months) HCC recurrence

PARAGRAPH

Among all variables evaluated in the univariate logistic Cox regression analysis (Table 2), considering 157 patients at risk of early recurrence, early recurrence was associated with etiology, HCC diameter, HCC grading, resection margins <1 cm, satellitosis and being beyond the Milan criteria.

Multivariate Cox analysis showed that only viral (HCV, HBV) etiology, HCC grading (3 or 4), resection margins <1 cm and being beyond the Milan criteria were independently associated with early recurrence.

Early HCC recurrence-free survival is shown (Fig. 2).

SECTION

Risk factors for late (>24 months) HCC recurrence

PARAGRAPH

For the Cox univariate analysis, we considered 87 patients followed for at least 24 months (4 patients excluded due to incomplete follow-up, in particular 1 patient underwent liver transplantation within 24 months of surgery, and 3 patients died within 24 months of surgery) without early recurrence.

HCC late recurrence was associated with the presence of esophageal varices, spleen length, platelet/spleen length ratio <909, LSM and SSM.

At Cox multivariate analysis, only an increase in SSM values was independently associated with a major risk of the late recurrence of HCC (Table 3).

We defined SSM 70 kPa as the optimal cut-off value, which allowed us to obtain a positive predictive value of 75% and a negative predictive value of 75%.

Late HCC recurrence-free survival is shown in the subgroup of patients with SSM >70 kPa compared to those with SSM ≤70 kPa, with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.0002) (Fig. 3).

SECTION

Post hoc analyses

PARAGRAPH

We performed 2 non-planned post hoc analyses regarding the role of AFP in predicting early HCC recurrence and Metavir F4 fibrosis score in predicting late HCC recurrence.

PARAGRAPH

When we planned the study, AFP was not included in the model and thus, it was available for a subset of 80 patients.

We included AFP in the model for early HCC recurrence, obtaining a statistically significant result at univariate analysis: HR 1.039 (CI 1.013–1.066) for each 100 ng/ml AFP increase, p = 0.0036.

However, at multivariate analysis AFP was not statistically significant.

PARAGRAPH

Including Metavir score in a post hoc analysis as a predictor of late HCC recurrence, we obtained a statistically significant result at univariate analysis: HR 5.891 (CI 2.028–17.114) for Metavir F4 compared to Metavir F1,2,3, p = 0.0011.

In the multivariate analysis no variable remained statistically significant: Metavir score HR 3.72 (CI 0.946–14.481) p = 0.060; SSM HR 1.028 (CI 0.995–1.062) p = 0.0966.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The aim of our study was to investigate the potential role of LSM and SSM in predicting early and late HCC recurrence after surgery in cirrhotic patients.

The most significant result was that an increase in SSM was identified as the only predictor of late HCC recurrence.

In addition, we found that viral etiology and tumor characteristics (HCC grade, resection margins <1 cm, being beyond the Milan criteria) were independently associated with early recurrence of HCC.

PARAGRAPH

HCC is a frequent complication in patients with chronic liver diseases, and 1 of the most common malignancies worldwide.1,2

Tumor recurrence complicates 70% of cases of hepatic resection at 5 years, and is the expression of both intrahepatic metastasis (known as early recurrence) or the development of de novo tumors (late recurrence).3–8,34

PARAGRAPH

The recognition of predictive factors for both early and late HCC recurrence could improve the management of these patients.

While for early recurrence there is an agreement indicating that the most important predictors are the biological characteristics of the tumor,35,36 few data are available for late recurrence.21,22

PARAGRAPH

The results of the present study show that the late recurrence of HCC seems to be predicted by the severity of the liver disease, mainly expressed by LSM and SSM as non-invasive markers of PH, and not by the tumor characteristics.

In fact, late recurrence of HCC was associated with signs of PH such as the presence of EV, splenomegaly and its correlation with platelet count, LSM and SSM.

Meanwhile, early HCC recurrence was associated with viral etiology, HCC diameter, HCC grade, resection margins <1 cm, satellitosis and being beyond the Milan criteria.

These results suggest that late recurrence could be regarded as de novo tumor,37,38 with a different tumor biology compared to early HCC recurrence,35–36 which are distant in terms of time and not related to the primary HCC,10 but to an increasingly severe liver disease.10

PARAGRAPH

We observed a statistically significant difference in the curves for late HCC recurrence-free survival: patients with SSM >70 kPa had a higher recurrence rate (Fig. 3).

Moreover, using a cut-off of 70 kPa for SSM either the positive and the negative predictive values were 75%.

PARAGRAPH

To the best of our knowledge this is the first study documenting that SSM is an independent predictor of late HCC recurrence.

SSM is an accurate non-invasive method for the assessment of the degree of PH, as previously demonstrated by our group18 and others.39

It is widely accepted that the degree of PH negatively influences the natural history of chronic liver disease,14 including HCC occurrence.15

We also found that SSM can predict liver disease complications, including HCC development.19

PARAGRAPH

The predictive role of SSM in late HCC recurrence that we observed in the present study confirms that SSM represents an accurate non-invasive surrogate marker of PH, since PH is one of the pathogenetic factors involved in HCC development.14

In fact cirrhosis scars may be associated with vascular proliferation due to an impaired oxygen delivery caused by intrahepatic shunts, veno-occlusive thrombotic lesions, a reduction in the sinusoidal area, sinusoidal capillarization and increased resistance to blood flow.40

Thus, angiogenic factors are more highly expressed by hepatocytes in cirrhotic nodules, above all by the production of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and other cytokines, which induce both fibrogenesis and angiogenesis, finally leading to PH and carcinogenesis.41

PARAGRAPH

As far as LSM is concerned, Jung et al.21,22 found a correlation between late HCC recurrence and LSM.

Conversely, we found a positive correlation between LSM and late HCC recurrence only at univariate analysis, while at multivariate analysis only SSM, which was not measured by Jung et al.,21,22 correlated with late recurrence.

A possible explanation for these different results is the known better accuracy42 of SSM than LSM, as surrogate markers in evaluating PH, which plays an important role in HCC development and recurrence.15

PARAGRAPH

It is worth noting that in our series most of the HCC late recurrences occurred in patients with Metavir score F4 (Table 1), confirming that the late HCC recurrences develop mostly in advanced chronic liver disease.

However, the fibrosis staging according to the Metavir grade was not included in the model.

Indeed, we expected that most of the included patients would have Metavir F4 and this scoring system would not be able to describe a further progression of chronic advanced liver disease.

Otherwise, we included in the model other variables considered accurate in defining a disease progression in patients with Metavir F4, such as LSM and SSM, platelet count, spleen length and platelet count to spleen length ratio.

Anyway, we performed a post hoc analysis to assess the possible predictive role of Metavir F4 compared to Metavir F1-2–3.

At univariate analysis the result was statistically significant, but in the multivariate analysis no variable remained statistically associated to HCC late recurrences, underlining the critical problem of inflating the number of variables included in the model in the presence of suboptimal sample size.

PARAGRAPH

Taking into account early recurrence, our results confirm findings of other studies43–45 that this recurrence is predicted by intrinsic HCC characteristics and by the radicality of the surgical resection.

In fact, early recurrence was associated at multivariate analysis with the viral etiology of the underlying liver disease, tumor differentiation (grading), resection margins <1 cm, and HCC staging beyond Milan criteria.

When we planned the study, on the basis of conflicting results29,30 we decided to not include AFP as a predictor of early recurrence.

However, subsequently further studies become available and demonstrated a possible predictor role of this biomarker.31,32

Thus, we performed a post hoc analysis in the subset of 80 patients with available AFP values.

We obtained a statistically significant result at univariate analysis that did not remain significant in the multivariate analysis; with these limitations we cannot support the role of alpha-fetoprotein in our series for the prediction of early HCC recurrence.

PARAGRAPH

Most of the patients enrolled had an HCV-related liver disease.

HCV liver disease etiology has already been investigated and associated with a higher risk of HCC recurrence after hepatectomy.46,47

Sasaki et al.47 showed that patients with HCV had a 2–5% higher incidence of HCC recurrence than those with HBV after 20 months post-resection, and HCV was found to be an independent predictor of HCC recurrence.

In addition, another recent study48 highlighted that HCV association with HCC recurrence was stronger in the first year after resection and subsequently the trend decreased.

PARAGRAPH

Regarding the Milan criteria, the relationship between tumor size, number, resection margins <1 cm and recurrence is clear.49

HCC nodules ≥5 cm in diameter are associated with an increased recurrence rate50,51 due to the higher risk of intrahepatic metastases, invasion of the portal vein,50 and microvascular invasion,51 which are all observed in the presence of larger tumors.

PARAGRAPH

Our data confirm that tumor grade is another strong predictor of early recurrence,27,49,52 although it is well known that its predictive value is related to microvascular invasion:27,53,54 a poorly differentiated tumor brings a 2-fold increased risk of early recurrence compared to well-moderately differentiated tumors.27

PARAGRAPH

By identifying completely different predictors among the early and late recurrences, our results may indirectly confirm previous studies which showed that 2 years (24 months) is the correct time interval to discriminate between early and late HCC recurrence.2,37

PARAGRAPH

A limitation of the present study is that we observed only 27 late recurrences of HCC and, assessing many variables, we cannot rule out that there may have been a data bias and some overfitting.

We aimed to assess the predictors of early and late recurrences after HCC curative resection, above all LSM and SSM, and we also had to test other plausible predictors.

However, there is little data available on HCC recurrence predictors and we probably introduced too many variables compared to the realistically expected number of events.

However, we performed the study in a single center to minimize other factors related to different surgical techniques.

PARAGRAPH

Another limitation was that we were unable to evaluate, in patients with HCV-related liver disease, the possible effect of the new direct antiviral agents (DAAs) on HCC recurrence.

In fact, all our patients were enrolled in a pre-era DAAs era and only 39 out of 93 (41.9%) patients with HCV reached the DAA era without HCC recurrence; 38 out of 39 patients (97.4%) reached sustained virological response and 5 of them developed late HCC recurrence.

Due to the small sample size it is not possible to evaluate a potential effect of HCV eradication with DAAs on HCC recurrence.

However, this association is still under debate.55–57

The strength of our study is that in a single tertiary center we were able to explore both early and late recurrence in a cohort of candidates for HCC surgical resection, thus variability in surgical approach and technique were minimized.

Inclusion in the study was based on accepted and validated criteria,2 and consequently our cohort can be considered representative of patients with HCC and the results can be generalized or transferred to similar contexts.

In addition, only around 10% (18/175) of the enrolled patients were lost at follow-up.

Regarding the LSM and SSM feasibility, spleen stiffness measurement produced invalid results in 15 patients out of 157 (10%) (Fig. 1) and LSM was invalid in 6 of these 15 patients (3.8% out of 157 patients).

These data are in accordance with the literature,18,19,58 which reports percentages ranging from 10% to about 15%.

Using patients with early recurrence-free survival as an inception cohort enabled us to demonstrate a statistically significant association of late HCC recurrence with SSM.

PARAGRAPH

However other factors not explored in this study could play a role, and the actual predictive accuracy seems at least moderate, thus preventing the creation of an accurate predictive model.

Additional studies are thus needed to validate the present results and to explore the possible role of other predictors.

PARAGRAPH

It is known that a follow-up after resection is recommended due to high rates of treatable recurrences;59 in fact, the European Association for the Study of the Liver recently published HCC recommendations advising a 3–4 month interval of follow-up in the first year after resection for primary HCC.

For late HCC recurrence, the follow-up strategies are still not clearly defined.

According to our results, we suggest performing SSM before HCC resection, in order to help the clinician in designing a tailored surveillance program mainly for those patients with SSM >70 kPa.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, SSM seems to be an independent predictor of HCC late recurrence after liver resection, since it is directly correlated with the degree of liver disease and PH. In addition, our study confirms that tumor-related factors such as viral etiology, HCC grade, resection margins <1 cm and being beyond the Milan criteria are independently associated with early recurrence.
