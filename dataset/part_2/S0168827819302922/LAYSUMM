TITLE

Contributing factors and outcomes of burn-associated cholestasis

PARAGRAPH

Cholestasis is common after burn injuries and is associated with burn severity, sepsis, organ failure and mortality.

Patients with hyperbilirubinemia without elevated alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase levels after the burn injury have a poor prognosis.

Patients with burn-associated cholestasis may develop sclerosing cholangitis and secondary biliary cirrhosis.
