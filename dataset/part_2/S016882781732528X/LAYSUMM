Modelling the elimination of hepatitis C as a public health threat in Iceland: A goal attainable by 2020

PARAGRAPH

In Iceland, a nationwide program has been launched offering treatment for the entire population living with hepatitis C virus (HCV).

A mathematical model was used to estimate the additional health system requirements to achieve the HCV elimination targets of the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as the year that this could occur.

With some additional screening of people who inject drugs, Iceland could reach the WHO targets by 2020, becoming one of the first countries to achieve HCV elimination.

The model estimated that once elimination targets were reached, maintaining current monitoring and harm reduction services while providing ongoing access to DAA therapy for people diagnosed with HCV would ensure that future HCV outbreaks are unlikely to occur.
