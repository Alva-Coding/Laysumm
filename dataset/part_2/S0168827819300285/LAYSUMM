TITLE

Central role of the β-cell in driving regression of diabetes after liver transplantation in cirrhotic patients

PARAGRAPH

Diabetes occurring in cirrhosis as a direct consequence of loss of liver function should regress after transplantation of a new functioning liver, though the pathophysiological mechanisms are unclear.

This is the first study evaluating the contribution of all 3 direct determinants of insulin-dependent glucose regulation using a sophisticated mathematical model.

Results show that β-cell function is the key process governing favourable or detrimental changes in glucose regulation in cirrhotic patients undergoing transplantation, pointing to the need to develop therapies to sustain β-cell function in these individuals.
