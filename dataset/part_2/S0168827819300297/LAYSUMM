TITLE

Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor efavirenz activates PXR to induce hypercholesterolemia and hepatic steatosis

PARAGRAPH

Efavirenz is widely prescribed for HIV-infected patients but has some side effects.

It can increase lipid levels in patientsâ€™ blood and liver.

Here we show that efavirenz can activate a unique liver protein called PXR which mediates the adverse effects of efavirenz on lipid levels in mouse models.
