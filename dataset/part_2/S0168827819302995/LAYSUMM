TITLE

MMP2/MMP9-mediated CD100 shedding is crucial for inducing intrahepatic anti-HBV CD8 T cell responses and HBV clearance

PARAGRAPH

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health problem worldwide.

The clearance of HBV relies largely on an effective T cell immune response, which usually becomes dysregulated in chronic HBV infection.

Our study provides a new mechanism to elucidate HBV persistence and a new target for developing immunotherapy strategies in patients chronically infected with HBV.
