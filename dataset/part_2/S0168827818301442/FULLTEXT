TITLE

The prognostic value of acute-on-chronic liver failure during the course of severe alcoholic hepatitis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Severe alcoholic hepatitis (sAH) is a complication of alcoholic liver disease associated with high mortality.1–4

Several studies have shown that in patients suffering from sAH, with a Maddrey discriminant function (mDF) score of more than 32, the use of corticosteroids (CS) significantly improves survival.2,5–8

Nevertheless, the long-term benefit of CS on survival of patients with sAH has not been clearly established.

A recent large randomized controlled study (the STOPAH study) provided evidence that 90-day mortality for sAH was about 30% with or without this treatment.9

A more accurate stratification system is needed to help clinicians identify patients at high risk of death in sAH.10

PARAGRAPH

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a newly described syndrome that can occur during the course of chronic liver disease.11,12

It is characterized by an acute decompensation of cirrhosis (ascites, encephalopathy, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and/or bacterial infection) along with at least one failure of the following organs or systems: liver, kidney, brain, coagulation, circulation, or lungs.13

The onset of ACLF dramatically reduces survival in chronic liver disease.14,15

ACLF develops as a consequence of an acute burst of systemic inflammation and potentially occurs secondarily to well-defined precipitating events.12

Both bacterial infections and active alcoholism have been identified as major events that can act as triggers for ACLF.16

The identification of ACLF is frequent during the time course of sAH.

ACLF can be established at the time of diagnosis of AH (prevalent ACLF [pACLF]) but can also develop during the course of medical management of this disease (incidental ACLF [iACLF]).14

Questions remain regarding the prognostic role of ACLF on mortality in sAH.

Moreover, the relationship between underlying infection and the occurrence of ACLF in sAH has yet to be determined.

PARAGRAPH

The aims of this study were, first, to evaluate the prognostic value of pACLF on the course of severe AH, and, second, to analyze the occurrence and impact of iACLF on outcomes for AH.

The predictive value of underlying infection on death and ACLF in these patients was also studied.

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Study population

PARAGRAPH

This study was a single-center cohort study based on an ongoing database of all consecutive patients admitted for severe AH to the Liver Unit of Erasme Hospital, Bruxelles, Belgium (retrospective analysis of a prospective database).

The present study analyzed data for patients admitted from July 2006, to July 2015.

The development of this prospective database of all patients suffering from AH was approved by the local institutional review board (Erasme-ULB Ethics Committee, reference: B2011/005).

Written informed consent was obtained from each patient.

To be included in the prospective database, the following eligibility criteria were checked: i) age of at least 18 years, ii) heavy consumption of alcohol (above 40 g/day for women and 50 g/day for men), iii) mDF ≥32, iv) absence of pregnancy and hepatocellular carcinoma, and (v) recent onset of jaundice (serum bilirubin level ≥5 mg) within the past three months.

Histological proof of AH was mandatory.17

To be included in the present study, patients must have had regular follow-up at the Erasme Hospital.

Other exclusion criteria included the presence of human immunodeficiency virus antibodies and transjugular intrahepatic porto-sytemic shunt.

SECTION

Patient follow-up and assessment of infectious episodes

PARAGRAPH

Baseline was defined as the date of liver biopsy.

Mortality was assessed at 28 days and 168 days after inclusion.

Clinical and biological monitoring was scheduled daily during the first week after biopsy, weekly during the first month, and monthly thereafter for the next five months.

To provide systematic detection of infections, two strategies were applied.

First, a complete screening procedure for infections using a time-scheduling strategy was implemented.

From the day of inclusion to day seven, a daily evaluation was performed including clinical and biological evaluation, chest X-ray, urinary sediment and urinary culture, and ascitic fluid cell count and culture (if applicable).

Blood cultures were mandatory in the presence of fever (≥38.5 °C) and/or any established infection.

After the first week, this complete evaluation was repeated weekly for one month and monthly for the five remaining months.

Second, in any case of suspicion of infection (based on clinical or biological indicators) occurring out of this scheduled screening, the complete previously described procedure (including blood cultures) was performed.

In infected patients, antibiotics were given as appropriate.18,19

Data for the type of bacterial or fungal infection, site of acquisition, and resistance to antibiotics (multidrug resistance [MDR]) were collected to assess relationships between these factors and the occurrence of ACLF and mortality.

The pathogens/sites of infection that are considered in this analysis are those documented the day of ACLF in patients with pACLF or those which preceded ACLF (maximum seven days before) in cases of iACLF.

Standard criteria were used to define and diagnose bacterial/fungal infections.18,19

Details on these criteria are summarized (Table S1).

SECTION

Assessment of ACLF episodes

PARAGRAPH

The presence of ACLF was assessed at baseline and during the study period.

The criteria for ACLF diagnosis and grades were based on those of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)-Chronic Liver Failure (CLIF) Consortium and were derived from the CANONIC study (Table S2).11,12,20

Patients were classified either according to the grade of ACLF or according to the presence of ACLF irrespective of the grade.

PARAGRAPH

Two scoring systems were selected to evaluate the severity and prognosis of ACLF: the CLIF-OFs and the CLIF-C ACLF.

The CLIF-OFs assigns a sub-score based on a three-point range to each organ system, resulting in a final CLIF-OFs ranging from 6 to 18 (Table S2).11,12

The CLIF-C ACLFs incorporates the CLIF-OFs and two other independent prognostic indicators of mortality, age and white blood cell count.

The calculation of the CLIF-C ACLFs is available on the CLIF Consortium website (http://www.clifresearch.com/ToolsCalculators.aspx).

SECTION

Treatment protocol for AH

PARAGRAPH

The use of CS was considered the standard of care for biopsy-proven AH.

The presence of an underlying infection at admission was not considered to be an absolute contraindication to CS administration.

CS were not given only if antibiotics failed to control the infection.18

Lille scores were calculated after seven days of corticosteroid therapy or at day seven if the patient did not receive any CS.21

Calculating the Lille score and its formula has been previously described (http://www.lillemodel.com).

CS treatment was continued for 28 days if the patient was responding to treatment (Lille score less than 0.45).

In cases of non-response to medical therapy, patients were evaluated for early liver transplantation (LT), as previously described, with highly selective criteria.22

SECTION

Validation cohort with an independent series

PARAGRAPH

The results of the present study (patients from Erasme Hospital) were compared with patients from an independent validation cohort: the European CANONIC cohort.12

In the CANONIC study, histological proof of AH was not mandatory.

To select the patients with a high suspicion of sAH (probable sAH), the following criteria, were applied:23 active alcoholism, serum total bilirubin ≥5 mg/dl at enrolment, aspartate aminotransferase >50 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio >1.5, PT below 50%.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Continuous data that were normally distributed are reported as mean ± SD.

Categorical variables are reported as counts and percentages.

Group comparisons were made using Student’s t test, the Mann-Whitney test, the Chi-squared test, or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.

Cumulative incidence of death (CID) was estimated at two different time-points: on days 28 and 168 after inclusion.

Data for patients were censored at the time of last contact or on day 168.

Throughout the study, LT was considered as a competing risk factor for the occurrence of death and for incidental ACLF.

A multistage approach using a competing risk method was employed: death, alive, or transplanted.

Gray’s test was used to test cause-specific death differences.

To assess factors predicting death and the incidence of ACLF, univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed using the Fine and Gray competing risks proportional hazards regression model.

The presence of iACLF and infection at any time were considered as time-dependent variables to assess risk factors in these models.

Multivariable models were built using the forward elimination technique and only variables that had p values less than 0.1 by univariate analysis were introduced into the model.

The results are presented as crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

The accuracy of CLIF-C ACLF and Maddrey score to predict mortality was assessed by Harrel’s C index.

To assess the occurrence of iACLF, a cumulative incidence function of ACLF was used to describe the probability of ACLF at a given time.

The time-dependent effect of incidental infection was estimated considering different time windows: first, using a 28- and 168-day delay of occurrence, and second, using a seven-day delay of occurrence before the incidental ACLF.

All tests were two-tailed and a p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Analyses were performed with the SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and R software, version 2.10.1 (CRAN project).

Results

SECTION

Patient characteristics, prevalence of ACLF at baseline, and treatment with corticosteroids

PARAGRAPH

A total of 213 patients had biopsy-proven AH during the study period while 165 fulfilled the criteria for inclusion (Fig. S1).

Clinical characteristics, biochemical values, and treatment at inclusion of the 165 included patients are summarized (Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

Seventy-nine patients (47.9%) fulfilled ACLF criteria at baseline, pACLF: the number of patients suffering from pACLF-1, pACLF-2, and pACLF-3 were 26 (15.7%), 24 (14.5%), and 29 (17.6%), respectively.

Forty-five patients (27.3%) did not receive CS because of an uncontrolled bacterial infection.

Among patients treated with CS, 70 (58.3%) were considered responders based on a Lille score <0.45.

SECTION

Cumulative incidence of death and factors associated with mortality

PARAGRAPH

Seventy-eight patients (47.3%) died in the whole group.

Only 10 patients died without any prior documented infection, but cause of death was multiple organ failure in all of them.

Sixteen patients underwent LT during the 168-day follow-up period (Fig. S2).

For the whole study population, 28-day and 168-day CID was 31% (95% CI 24–39%) and 47% (95% CI 39–55), respectively.

In patients treated with CS, 28-day and 168-day CID was 27% (95% CI 20–35) and 46% (95% CI 36–54), respectively.

The 28-day CID of patients who responded to CS (Lille score <0.45) was 14% (95% CI 7–23) and in non-responders it was 46% (95% CI 31–59), p <0.0001.

The 168-day CID of responders was 35% (95% CI 24–46%) and in non-responders it was 60% (95% CI 45–73), p <0.0001.

PARAGRAPH

Results of univariate and multivariate analysis of factors associated with 28-day mortality are shown (Table 2).

Significant predictors of death were subsequently introduced into the multivariate regression model.

Independent factors predicting 28-day CID were: the occurrence of an infection during follow-up, Maddrey score at baseline, and MELD score at biopsy.

Factors predicting 168-day mortality are shown (Table S3).

The 168-day CID without pACLF was 25.6% (95% CI 16.8–35.1).

SECTION

Accuracy of the CLIF-C ACLF scoring system for predicting mortality

PARAGRAPH

When calculated for the 79 patients suffering from pACLF at baseline, the Harrel’s C index for the CLIF-C ACLF score in predicting the risk of 28-day mortality was 0.68 (95% CI 0.59–0.76).

The C index for the Maddrey score (identified here as the best scoring system predicting death, see Table 2) in predicting the risk of 28-day mortality was 0.64 (95% CI 0.56–0.73).

In predicting the risk of 168-day mortality, the C index of CLIF-C ACLF was 0.67 (95% CI 0.59–0.74).

The C index of the Maddrey score in predicting the risk of 168-day mortality was 0.63 (95% CI 0.56–0.70).

SECTION

Impact of ACLF on the response to CS

PARAGRAPH

The response rate to CS in patients with and without pACLF was 21/55 (38.2%) and 49/64 (76.6%), respectively, p <0.0001.

For patients with ACLF-1, ACLF-2, and ACLF-3, the number of responders to CS was 12 (52.2%), 8 (42.1%), and 1 (8.3%) respectively, p <0.0001 (Fig. 2).

In patients with pACLF, the infection rate in responders to corticosteroids was 15/26 (57.7%) while it was 35/42 (83.3%) in non-responders (p = 0.026).

In patients with pACLF, 28-day CID with and without response to CS were 33.3% (95% CI 14.5–53.6) and 60.0% (95% CI 41.5–74.3), respectively, p = 0.018.

For these patients, 168-day CID with and without response to corticosteroids were 61.9% (95% CI 36.9–79.4) and 74.2% (95% CI 55.4–86.1), respectively, p = 0.080.

The 28-day CID in patients without ACLF responding and not responding to corticosteroids was 6% (95% CI 1–15) and 13% (95% CI 2–35), p = 0.35.

The 168-day CID in patients without ACLF responding and not responding to corticosteroids was 24% (95% CI 13–37) and 26% (95% CI 5–50), p = 0.75.

SECTION

Outcomes for patients with prevalent ACLF not treated with CS

PARAGRAPH

For the 23 patients with pACLF (whatever the grade) who did not receive CS (due to uncontrolled infection), the 28- and 168-day CID were 65% (95% CI 41–81) and 73% (95% CI 49–87), respectively.

For reference, the 28- and 168-day mortality rates for the 56 patients with pACLF treated with CS were 50% (95% CI 36–62) and 69% (95% CI 55–80), respectively.

SECTION

The importance, risk factors, and prognostic role of incidental ACLF

SECTION

Occurrence of incidental ACLF

PARAGRAPH

Eighty-six patients did not have pACLF.

Among these, 29 cases of iACLF were recorded at day 168.

The cumulative incidence of iACLF in patients without pACLF was 23% (95% CI 15–33%) at day 28 and 33% (95% CI 24–44) at day 168.

Forty-nine patients without pACLF were responders to CS.

Among these responders, 14 (28.6%) developed iACLF during follow-up (see Fig. S3).

When estimated only for patients who received CS, the cumulative incidence of iACLF was 22% (95% CI 13–33) at day 28 and 34% (95% CI 23–46) at day 168.

SECTION

Risk factors for incidental ACLF

PARAGRAPH

Variables predicting 28-day iACLF are shown (Table 3).

The variables predicting 168-day incidental ACLF are also shown (Table S4).

The occurrence of a prior incidental infection was the only independent variable predicting the onset of 28-day incidental ACLF.

Considering a recent infection as a trigger of iACLF, the risk of 28-day iACLF in patients who developed an infection seven days or less before this event was 92.8% (95% CI 39.7–99.8) while it was 21.7% (95% CI 12.8–32.1) in patients without an infection in the previous seven days.

SECTION

Prognosis of incidental ACLF

PARAGRAPH

The 28-day and 168-day CID for patients without pACLF who developed iACLF (occurring until day 28 and day 168 of follow-up) were 27.6% (95% CI 12.8–44.6) and 55.2% (95% CI 34.9–71.4), respectively.

The relative risk of death in patients who developed a prior iACLF was 41.87 (95% CI 5.231–335.1, p <0.001) at day 28 and 10.08 (95% CI 4.099–24.8, p <0.001) at day 168.

SECTION

Association between infectious episodes, the occurrence of ACLF, and 28-day mortality

PARAGRAPH

Data on the type of bacterial/fungal infection associated with pACLF or iACLF are summarized (Table S5).

The type of pathogen, the site of infection, and the presence of multidrug resistance to antibiotics were not significantly associated with the occurrence of pACLF, iACLF, or 28-day mortality.

Results of these analyses are available (Table S6A–C).

SECTION

Characteristics and results from patients in the validation cohort

PARAGRAPH

A total of 97 patients suffering from probable sAH constituted the validation cohort.

Their clinical characteristics and biochemical values at baseline (day 0) are summarized (Table 1).

For the whole validation cohort, the 28-day CID was 17.5% (95% CI 10.7–25.7) and the 168-day CID was 35.5% (95% CI 26.3–45.1).

Forty-four patients (45.4%) fulfilled ACLF criteria at baseline: the number of patients suffering from pACLF-1, pACLF-2, and pACLF-3 were 16 (16.5%), 22 (22.7%), and 6 (6.2%), respectively.

The 28-day CID for patients with and without pACLF was 29.5% (95% CI 16.8–43.4) and 7.5% (95% CI 2.4–16.7), respectively, p <0.0001.

The 28-day CID for patients with pACLF-1, pACLF-2, and pACLF-3 were 31.2% (95% CI 10.8–54.4), 13.6% (95% CI 3.6–31.3), and 83.3% (95% CI 8.6–98.6), respectively, p <0.0001 (see Fig. S4).

The 168-day CID for patients with and without pACLF were 50.7% (95% CI 34.8–64.6) and 22.6% (95% CI 12.6–35.3), respectively, p <0.0001.

The 168-day CID for patients with pACLF-1, pACLF-2, and pACLF-3 were 50.0% (95% CI 23.9–73.9), 40.9% (95% CI 20.2–60.6), and 83.3% (95% CI 8.6–98.6), respectively, p <0.0001.

PARAGRAPH

When calculated for patients with prevalent ACLF, the C Index for the CLIF-C ACLF score in predicting the risk of 28-day mortality was 0.80 (95% CI 0.65–0.94).

In predicting the risk of 168-day mortality, the C Index of CLIF-C ACLF was 0.74 (95% CI 0.63–0.80).

PARAGRAPH

The cumulative incidence of iACLF at day 28 was 11.4% (95% CI 4.5–21.6).

The 28-day and 168-day CID for patients without pACLF who developed iACLF were 33.3% (95% CI 3.3–70.4) and 83.3% (95% CI 8.6–98.6), respectively.

In patients who developed iACLF, the relative risk of death was 21.7 (95% CI 1.9–239.9), p <0.001 at day 28 and 16.4 (95% CI 4.79–56.5), p <0.001 at day 168.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

This study shows that ACLF is frequent in sAH and has a negative impact on survival, in both the prevalent and incidental types of this syndrome.

PARAGRAPH

Severe AH is characterized by high mortality, so it is important to identify factors predicting poor prognosis.24

ACLF usually develops secondary to bacterial infection or active alcoholism.16

The major aim of the current study was to determine the prognostic role of ACLF in the course of sAH and to assess the role of infection as a precipitating event for ACLF.

PARAGRAPH

The present study identified prevalent ACLF as a high-risk factor for mortality in sAH.

In a previous study, it has already been shown that systemic inflammatory response syndrome and lipopolysaccharide levels are major risk factors predicting multi-organ failure and death in AH.25

Identification of ACLF and bacterial/fungal infections are well-identifiable and easy-access parameters for clinicians in daily practice.

PARAGRAPH

In this study, risk of death was related to the severity of ACLF.

The validation cohort confirmed the high frequency of ACLF during the time course of sAH with a significant increase in mortality, especially in patients with ACLF-3.

In the main cohort, the presence of prevalent ACLF and its severity were associated with a decreased response to CS.

This could partially explain the higher mortality observed with more severe grades of ACLF.

PARAGRAPH

This work also showed that the CLIF-C ACLF score11 has poor sensitivity and specificity for early identification of patients at high risk of death at 28 and 168 days.

The CLIF-C ACLF score was not designed to predict mortality in patients with sAH.11

Its interpretation should be integrated with other scores including Child, MELD, and Maddrey.

PARAGRAPH

Focusing on the incidental type of ACLF, this work highlighted the high incidence of this syndrome during sAH.

iACLF was associated with a dramatic excess of mortality.

The validation cohort confirmed that the occurrence of iACLF was related to a high risk of death.

Onset of iACLF was observed in 28% of patients who responded to CS suggesting that these patients must be closely monitored for the occurrence of ACLF during follow-up.

PARAGRAPH

Patients with prevalent ACLF who were treated or not treated with CS had a 168-day mortality of about 70%.

In the present work, no comparison between patients with and without CS could be conducted, but these similar results raise an important issue.

That is, how do we identify which patients may not benefit from the use of CS?

It makes sense to further these investigations by initiating a randomized controlled trial assessing the beneficial effect of CS in patients with ACLF.

Patients with ACLF grade 2 and 3 in this study had the highest mortality, and these results bring into question the benefit of using CS in such a sick population.

Developing new strategies in the management of severe forms of AH is of major importance.

PARAGRAPH

This work confirmed the high risk of infection during the time course of sAH.26,27

Moreover, this work showed that the occurrence of an infection strongly predicts and acts as a trigger to the development of iACLF during the time course of AH.

It should be underlined that one limitation of the present study is the relatively small number of iACLF cases.

This could introduce imprecision into the assessment of risk factors for this event.

The authors of the CANONIC study showed previously that infections and heavy alcohol consumption during the previous three months were both major triggers for the development of ACLF.12

In the present study, infection was also identified as a major trigger in the development of ACLF.

However, in a non-negligible proportion of cases (56% of pACLF and 45% of iACLF), no infections were documented.

This finding suggests a contrario that ACLF can occur during the time course of sAH without any overt infection.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, in order to help clinicians identify patients with a high risk of death, this work highlighted that both prevalent and incidental ACLF is associated with high mortality in AH.

Infections are a major risk factor for developing this newly described clinical entity.
