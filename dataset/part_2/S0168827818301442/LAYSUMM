TITLE

The prognostic value of acute-on-chronic liver failure during the course of severe alcoholic hepatitis

PARAGRAPH

In patients with chronic liver disease, an acute deterioration of liver function combined with single or multiple organ failures is known as acute-on-chronic liver failure.

This study shows that acute-on-chronic liver failure is frequent during the course of severe alcoholic hepatitis.

In severe alcoholic hepatitis, acute-on-chronic liver failure is associated with high mortality and frequently occurs after an infection.
