ABSTRACT

TITLE

The prognostic value of acute-on-chronic liver failure during the course of severe alcoholic hepatitis

PARAGRAPH

A better identification of factors predicting death is needed in alcoholic hepatitis (AH).

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) occurs during the course of liver disease and can be identified when AH is diagnosed (prevalent ACLF [pACLF]) or during follow-up (incidental ACLF [iACLF]).

This study analyzed the impact of ACLF on outcomes in AH and the role of infection on the onset of ACLF and death.

PARAGRAPH

Patients admitted from July 2006 to July 2015 suffering from biopsy-proven severe (s)AH with a Maddrey discriminant function (mDF) ≥32 were included.

Infectious episodes, ACLF, and mortality were assessed during a 168-day follow-up period.

Results were validated on an independent cohort.

PARAGRAPH

One hundred sixty-five patients were included.

Mean mDF was 66.3 ± 20.7 and mean model for end-stage liver disease score was 26.8 ± 7.4.

The 28-day cumulative incidence of death (CID) was 31% (95% CI 24–39%).

Seventy-nine patients (47.9%) had pACLF.

The 28-day CID without pACLF and with pACLF-1, pACLF-2, and pACLF-3 were 10.4% (95% CI 5.1–18.0), 30.8% (95% CI 14.3–49.0), 58.3% (95% CI 35.6–75.5), and 72.4% (95% CI 51.3–85.5), respectively, p <0.0001.

Twenty-nine patients (17.5%) developed iACLF.

The 28-day relative risk of death in patients developing iACLF was 41.87 (95% CI 5.2–335.1; p <0.001).

A previous infection was the only independent risk factor for developing iACLF during the follow-up.

Prevalence, incidence, and impact on prognosis of ACLF were confirmed in a validation cohort of 97 patients with probable sAH.

PARAGRAPH

ACLF is frequent during the course of sAH and is associated with high mortality.

Infection strongly predicts the development of ACLF in this setting.
