TITLE

Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) modulates liver ischemia reperfusion through the expression adhesion molecules

PARAGRAPH

Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) is as an important modulator of polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN)-induced liver injury, which occurs in ischemia-reperfusion.

Here, we show that the NOD1 pathway targets liver adhesion molecule expression on the endothelium and on hepatocytes through p38 and ERK signaling pathways.

The early increase of adhesion molecule expression after reperfusion emphasizes the importance of adhesion molecules in liver injury.

In this study we generated nanoparticles loaded with NOD1 antagonist.

These nanoparticles reduced liver necrosis by reducing PMN liver infiltration and adhesion molecule expression.
