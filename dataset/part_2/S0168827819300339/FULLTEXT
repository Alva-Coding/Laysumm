TITLE

Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) modulates liver ischemia reperfusion through the expression adhesion molecules

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

In the field of liver transplantation, organ shortage is a major issue; especially in western countries where the living donor transplantation is still scare.

This situation led transplant units to use of liver allografts following donation after cardiac death along with marginal and extended criteria donors.1

These marginal grafts are known to be more susceptible to early graft dysfunction and retransplantation, increasing morbidity and mortality2–5 mostly due to liver ischemia–reperfusion (IR) injuries.6,7

Liver IR is a biphasic phenomenon in which hypoxia-induced lesions are exacerbated, after oxygen delivery is restored, by shear stress and tissue infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs).8

This process of liver injury also occurs during hemodynamic instability and hepatic resection.

It is a frequent cause of acute liver dysfunction.2–5,9,10

Thus, preventing IR and its consequences remains a clinical challenge.

PARAGRAPH

The pathophysiology of liver IR involves numerous cells (i.e. PMN, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatocytes) and is considered to be an experimental model of PMN-mediated hepatitis.3

The process of injury occurs during the reperfusion phase with PMN infiltration11.

The first step of this event is the interaction between PMNs and the endothelium, allowing PMNs to enter the liver parenchyma.

The upregulation of adhesion molecules (i.e. ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin) on LSECs follows reperfusion, allowing PMN recruitment in the rolling process,12 through the binding of neutrophil adhesion molecules L-Selectin and Mac-1, an heterodimeric integrin (CDb/CD18).13

The dual role and interactions between the endothelium and PMNs are accepted to be a cornerstone of the pathophysiology of liver IR.

Thus, inhibiting adhesion molecule expression (such as ICAM, VCAM, E-selectin, CD44 and PECAM) or using blocking antibodies have been widely studied to reduce liver injury.14

PARAGRAPH

Contrary to the endothelium, the mechanisms driving the interaction between PMNs and hepatocytes during liver IR remain to be clarified.

The expression of adhesion molecules by the hepatocyte has been suggested to be important for its interaction with PMNs during IR.15

Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) has been shown to be expressed on the plasma membrane of hepatocytes under IR conditions.15

However, it remains unclear whether the regulation of ICAM expression on the hepatocyte impacts the severity of IR lesions.

PARAGRAPH

There is evidence that damage-associated molecular patterns and pathogen-associated molecular patterns activate PMNs16,17 leading to IR-mediated liver injury.

We previously showed that activation of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1), a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor, was responsible for activation of PMN function and migration.18

Indeed, by activating mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases such as p38, NOD1 leads to PMN infiltration in the liver, facilitating injury in a model of liver IR.

At the opposite, Nod1 knockout (KO) mice were protected against liver IR injury.18

In addition, NOD1 is significantly expressed in the liver and in hepatocytes,19 thus the NOD1 pathway appears to be a promising target for liver IR injury regulation.

PARAGRAPH

The aim of our study was to dissect the role of the NOD1 pathway on the expression of adhesion molecules in the liver, and more specifically in endothelial cells and in hepatocytes.

As IR lesions are induced by PMN liver parenchyma infiltration, we also explored the modulation of hepatocytes and PMN interaction by NOD1.

Then, as proof of concept, we tested NOD1 as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of IR lesions in a mouse model, by treating mice with a NOD1 inhibitor.

Reagents

PARAGRAPH

Three different NOD1 agonists were used in this study.

The natural ligand iE-DAP (1 µg/ml in vitro and 5 mg/kg in vivo) and its derivative C12-iE-DAP (100 ng/ml in vitro and 3.3 mg/kg in vivo) were obtained from InvivoGen (Toulouse, France).

FK565 (synthetic ligand, 10−6 M in vitro and 1 mg/kg in vivo) was obtained from Dr. M. Chamaillard.

TNFα (50 ng/ml) and IFNγ (100 ng/ml) were obtained from R&D (Lille, France).

We used ML-130 (Notilinib) and ALINO73 (analog of SB71120) synthetized by Natascha Leleu-Chavain as described as NOD1 antagonists.20,21

The ERK inhibitor (U0126, Sigma, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France) and p38 inhibitors (SB203580, InvivoGen, Toulouse France) were used at 10 µM.

Resomer RG503H was used as a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) matrix (Evonik Industries AG, Deutschland) (Supplementary CTAT Table).

SECTION

Animals

PARAGRAPH

C57BL/6J wild-type mice (Janvier Labs, Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France), Nod1 KO (C57BL/6J background)18 and their wild-type littermates (Nod1 WT) were used in this study.

Animals were kept in a controlled environment (12 h light/dark cycles) and fed a standard rodent pellet diet (RM1, Special Diet Service, France) ad libitum.

Experiments performed on animals were approved by the local ethics committee (n° 01757.01) in accredited facilities (n°B59-35010) according to government guidelines (n°2010/63/UE).

Ethics committee number for animal experiments: n° 01757.01.

SECTION

IR injury

PARAGRAPH

We used a murine model of 70% partial hepatic ischemia for 60 min.

Mice were or were not treated with a NOD1 agonist 24 h and 4 h before surgery.

Then mice were anesthetized with 10 mg/kg xylazine and 100 mg/kg ketamine, and a midline laparotomy was performed.

The left lateral and median lobes of the liver were ligatured using Ethicon mersutures™ F2541 (Ethicon, Issy Les Moulineaux, France).

After 60 min of ischemia, the ligature was removed to initiate hepatic reperfusion.

Mice were sacrificed 3 h (for hepatocyte isolation of the ex vivo experiment) or at 4, 8 and 20 h after reperfusion.

Blood and liver samples were collected for analysis at each time point.

Liver samples were fixed in paraformaldehyde 4% (w/v in PBS) and paraffin embedded or snap frozen.

SECTION

Cell isolation and culture

PARAGRAPH

PMNs were isolated following sterile peritonitis as previously described.22

Briefly, mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml of a solution of oyster glycogen at 150 µg/µl in phosphate buffer saline (PBS).

Mice were sacrificed 16 h later and peritoneal cells were harvested using 5 ml of sterile PBS without Ca2+/Mg2+.

Exudate cells were determined to be >95% neutrophils by flow cytometry.

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocytes were isolated by the collagenase perfusion method.23

Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 2% isofluran.

After laparotomy, the portal vein was cannulated (24G catheter, Terumo, Guyancourt, France).

The liver was then perfused for 10 to 20 min at 5 ml/min with washing buffer (HBSS without Ca2+ Mg2+, EDTA 0.5 mM, HEPES 50 mM), then perfused with collagenase buffer (HBSS without Ca2+ Mg2+, HEPES 50 mM, CaCl2 50 mM, Collagenase type IV 0.0025% 850 CDU/mg (C5138, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France) for 6 min at 5 ml/min.

PARAGRAPH

Following perfusion, the liver was collected in washing buffer and the Glisson’s capsule was cut.

Cell suspension was filtered in a 70 µM cell strainer.

Cells were washed twice with washing buffer and centrifuged at 50 g for 2 min at room temperature to pellet murine hepatocytes.

Hepatocytes were then washed with hepatocyte culture medium (DMEM Glutamax, glucose 4.5 g/L, Gentamycin 1%, FCS 10%, 10−7 M dexamethasone) and centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min.

One million hepatocytes were plated in 6-well plate (Sarstedt, Marnay, France).

PARAGRAPH

The main challenge to investigate the hepatocyte expression of adhesion molecules was to avoid any contamination of LSECs during the isolation of the mouse primary hepatocytes.

To deal with this contingency, we have optimized our experimental method and checked the purity of isolated hepatocyte by FACS using CD31 as a marker for endothelial cell contamination.

A purity >99% was considered acceptable (Fig. S1).

In addition, a cytospin followed by cell staining were performed before in vitro and ex vivo analysis to confirm purity.

PARAGRAPH

Primary Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained from Prof. Eric Boulanger (Lille, France) and were maintained in endothelial cell basal medium supplemented with Bullet Kit (EBM-2) on a culture flask coated with 0.1% gelatin and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% carbon dioxide.

HUVECs cultured from passages 4 to 8 were used for the experiments.

SECTION

Hepatocyte and PMN co-culture

PARAGRAPH

Freshly isolated hepatocytes were plated on a 48-well plate (1.25 × 105 cell per well) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 36 h. Purified peritoneal PMN (6.25 × 105 cell per well) were or were not added to the hepatocyte culture for 4 h in HBSS medium (without phenol red).

Supernatants were then harvested and centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min to discard cells and debris.

These supernatants were used to quantify lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity using the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche, Boulogne-Billancourt, France).

SECTION

Real-time PCR for mRNA quantification

PARAGRAPH

Real-time PCR analyses were performed for quantification of mRNA expression.

Mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a housekeeping gene.

Sequence-specific PCR primers were designated using Primer3 Software;24,25 see Table S1 and Supplementary CTAT Table for details).

Total RNA was extracted from isolated hepatocytes or liver samples using Nucleospin®RNAII (Macherey-Nagel EURL, Hoerdt, France).

First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg total RNA using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France).

Real-time PCR was performed using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in StepOne plus (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

SECTION

Western blot

PARAGRAPH

For western blot studies, proteins were extracted from liver samples or isolated hepatocytes in a lysis buffer including PBS with 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 100 mM Phenyl Methyl Sulfonyl Fluoride and a classical protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) as well as phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, Lyon, France).

Fifty micrograms of total proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted on nitrocellulose membranes.

Membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies (see Table S2 and Supplementary CTAT Table for details).

Immunodetection was completed with a secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:1,000, Dako Laboratories, Trappes, France) and chemiluminescence was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Orsay, France).

β-actin was used as a loading control.

Band intensity was analyzed using the MM4000 Pro (CareStream, Noisy-le-Grand, France), quantified using Image J (NIH) and compared to β-actin.

Results were expressed as relative units (RU).

SECTION

Immunohistochemistry, necrosis area quantification & liver PMN quantification

PARAGRAPH

Liver samples were fixed in paraformaldehyde (PFA) 4% and embedded in paraffin.

Four-micrometer-thick sections were exposed to primary antibodies after a specific step of heat-performed antigen retrieval (see Table S2 for details) and then to a biotinylated secondary antibody for 1 h.

After washing in TBS + 0.05% Tween 20, sections were incubated with strepavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Dako Laboratories, Trappes, France).

Staining was revealed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate (Dako Laboratories) for 1 to 5 min before the reaction was stopped in distilled water, and counterstained with hematoxylin.

Negative controls were incubated with irrelevant serum or isotype-matched immunoglobulin instead of the specific antibody.

Stained slides were observed and analyzed under a microscope (Leica, Bensheim, Germany).

Pictures were obtained using Axio Scan.Z1 (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany).

PARAGRAPH

Quantification of necrosis was obtained on digital images of IR livers (3 per mice) obtained from Axio Scan Z1 (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany).

The area of necrosis was defined as the ratio of (area of necrosis/ total liver area) × 100.

PARAGRAPH

Quantification of PMN infiltration was performed by counting PMN on 8–10 fields of necrosis and/or centrolobular area (magnification, 400) for each mouse.

SECTION

Human ICAM-1 promoter analysis

PARAGRAPH

The proximal human ICAM-1 promoter was amplified from human liver genomic DNA using the following primers: forward primer (5′-AGGGAGCTCTCGTCAAGATCCAAGCTAGCTG-3′) and (5′-GGAAGATCTGTGATCCTTTATAGCGCTAGCC-3′) corresponding to fragments between −895 and −57 upstream from ATG.

The purified fragment was cloned in the multiple cloning site of the reporter plasmid pGL4.10 [luc2] (Promega, France) using SalI and BglII (NEB, USA).

This construct (Prom ICAM, Fig. 5B) was amplified and purified before sequencing to confirm correct integration of the promoter.

CV-1 cells (ATCC® CCL-70™) were plated in 48-well plates (40,000 cells/well) and transfected with empty pGL4.10 [luc2] or Prom ICAM (100 ng/well) and a human NOD1 expression vector (20 ng/well, pHA-NOD1 kind gift from Dana J. Philpott).

After 20 h, cells were washed and lysed for luminescence quantification.

SECTION

Nanoparticle synthesis, formulation and characterization

PARAGRAPH

PLGA nanoparticles (np) were prepared as previously described.26

The Resomer RG503H (10 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of an organic phase consisting of acetone and ethanol (85:15).

After complete dissolution of the Resomer, it was injected into 10 ml water by stirring for 30 min at room temperature (21 to 24 °C).

Organic solvents were then evaporated with a rotary vacuum evaporator at 120 rpm, 28 °C for 4 min.

The resulting nanoparticles are used as a control (np).

Association with the NOD1 antagonist was performed by post-loading and adding the antagonists into the nanoparticle suspension.

ML130 was dissolved in DMSO at 100 mg/ml and loaded with np from 0.075% to 3% (w/w) for in vitro cell delivery corresponding to treatment from 0.125 to 5 µM (NP-ML130).

ALINO73 was dissolved in DMSO at 20 mg/ml and loaded with np from 0.2% to 4% (w/w) for in vitro cell delivery corresponding to treatment from 0.25 to 5 µM (npALINO).

For in vivo delivery, ALINO73 was loaded at 7.5% (w/w NP) and 5% (w/v) of glucose was added to the final suspension to compensate for osmolarity.

PARAGRAPH

The in vivo formulation of np ALINO was characterized for size (Z-Average = 92.8 nm) and zeta potential (−11.8 mV) respectively by dynamic light scattering and electrophoretic mobility analysis on a ZetaSizer NanoZS (Malvern Instrument, France).

The poly dispersity index was 0.259.

Statistics

PARAGRAPH

Data were expressed as medians, means ± SEM or means ± SD.

All comparisons were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test.

Statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism version 5.0, (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).

Differences were considered to be statistically significant if p was <0.05.

Results

SECTION

Induction of adhesion molecule expression in livers of mice treated with NOD1 agonists, in normal condition (without liver IR)

PARAGRAPH

Twenty hours after administering a NOD1 agonist injection under normal conditions (without liver IR), mouse livers displayed a significant induction of 2 important adhesion molecules, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, (1.4 RU vs. 0.8 RU, p = 0.032 and 0.25RU vs. 0.00 RU, p = 0.008 respectively), compared to vehicle-treated mice.

There was no effect of NOD1 agonist on E-selectin and P-selectin protein expression (Fig. 1A).

The immunostaining of ICAM-1 showed that NOD1 agonist treatment increased ICAM-1 expression not only on the endothelium but also on hepatocyte membranes compared to untreated livers which mainly displayed endothelial staining (Fig. 1B).

SECTION

NOD1 agonist increases liver IR injury and upregulates ICAM-1 and VCAM-1

PARAGRAPH

Twenty hours after IR, the livers of mice treated with the NOD1 agonist displayed a larger necrosis area than those treated with vehicle (Fig. 2A).

The kinetic analysis of PMN infiltration in liver parenchyma revealed that, regardless of NOD1 treatment, there was no PMN infiltration 4 h after reperfusion.

It became significant 8 h after reperfusion.

At 8 and 20 h after reperfusion, NOD1 agonist treatment significantly induced PMN liver infiltration compared to vehicle treatment.

Additionally, keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC) expression was upregulated 20 h after reperfusion in livers treated with the NOD1 agonist.

(Fig. 2B)

PARAGRAPH

Four hours after reperfusion, aminotransferases increased (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] 2,078 ± 350 IU/L vs. 1,921 ± 346.5 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase [ALT] 2,885 ± 547.7 IU/L vs. 2,610 ± 385 IU/L) without differences between the 2 treatment conditions (NOD1 agonist vs. vehicle).

ALT levels increased after 8 h of reperfusion, and were significantly higher in the NOD1 agonist group (3,910 ± 25 IU/L vs. 3,139.6 ± 292.5 IU/L; p = 0.05) whereas AST levels were not different in each group (1,802.0 ± 137.3 IU/L vs. 1,905 ± 159.6 IU/L).

After 20 h of reperfusion, the NOD1 agonist conditions presented significantly higher values of aminotransferases than vehicle conditions (AST 3,173 ± 96 IU/L vs. 2,402 ± 109 IU/L; p <0.01 and ALT 4,627 ± 78 IU/L vs. 3,062 ± 52 IU/L; p <0.01) (Fig. 2C).

PARAGRAPH

NOD1 agonist treatment upregulated Icam-1 and Vcam-1 mRNA expression at an early time point after reperfusion (4 h) (Fig. 2D).

This mRNA overexpression began before PMN infiltration and the establishment of histological necrosis (Fig. S2).

At a protein level, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were significantly induced 20 h after reperfusion in mice treated with NOD1 agonist (ICAM-1: 1.8 to 2.6 RU; p = 0.049 and VCAM-1: 0.37 to 0.94 RU; p = 0.049) (Fig. 2E).

PARAGRAPH

Considering other adhesion molecules, there was no difference of expression after NOD1 agonist treatment in liver IR condition for E-selectin and P-selectin (p <0.05) (Fig. 2E).

SECTION

NOD1 pathway targets ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in vitro in primary endothelial cells and hepatocytes

PARAGRAPH

HUVECs were cultured and exposed to NOD1 agonist at different dosages (0, 0.1 and 1 µg).

The mRNA expression of Icam-1, Vcam-1 and E-selectin were induced by NOD1 agonist treatment in a dose-dependent manner.

However, Pecam mRNA expression was not significantly modified by NOD1 activation (Fig. 3A).

PARAGRAPH

Mouse primary hepatocytes were cultured in vitro.

Before analysis, the purification of isolated cells was confirmed (hepatocyte purity >99%, Fig. S1).

Primary hepatocytes were then exposed to NOD1 agonists under basal or inflammatory (TNF/IFN) conditions.

As shown in Fig. 3B, Icam-1 mRNA was induced twice in Nod1 WT hepatocytes treated with the NOD1 agonist, as well as under inflammatory conditions induced by TNF/IFN.

Vcam-1 mRNA was significantly induced by NOD1 activation (1.2 RU vs. 3.3 RU, p = 0.005, Fig. 3A).

Induction of Icam-1 and Vcam-1 mRNA expression was synergistic with the NOD1 agonist and TNF/IFN treatments (Fig. 3B).

These data were confirmed at the protein level in mouse primary isolated hepatocytes which showed that ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were significantly increased by the NOD1 agonist both under basal and inflammatory conditions (Fig. 3D).

To confirm the specificity of the NOD1 agonist, hepatocytes were isolated from Nod1 KO mice and exposed to NOD1 agonist treatment under basal and inflammatory conditions.

Real-time PCR and western blot showed that the NOD1 agonist did not induce ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in Nod1 KO hepatocytes but responded to TNF/IFN treatment (Fig. 3C,E).

SECTION

NOD1 pathway targets ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression ex vivo in hepatocyte

PARAGRAPH

In ex vivo conditions, NOD1 agonist treatment of sham-operated mice induced significant hepatocyte expression of Icam-1 and Vcam-1 mRNA (6-fold and 10-fold increase, respectively) compared to vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 4A).

IR alone also induced Icam-1 and Vcam-1 mRNA (4-fold and 5-fold increase, respectively).

NOD1 activation during IR markedly increased hepatocyte Icam-1 and Vcam-1 mRNA expression (25-fold and 20-fold increase, respectively) compared to vehicle-treated sham animals (Fig. 4A).

At the protein level, NOD1 agonist treatment in sham-operated mice strongly induced hepatocyte expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (7.1-fold and 4.0-fold, respectively, Fig. 4C) compared to untreated mice.

After 3 h of reperfusion, induction of the ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 proteins also increased significantly (2.1-fold and 2.0-fold respectively, Fig. 4C).

NOD1 agonist-treated Nod1 WT mice that underwent liver IR showed massive induction of hepatocyte expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 protein (37-fold and 109-fold, respectively) compared to vehicle-treated sham animals.

More importantly, NOD1 agonist treatment increased ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 protein expression by 17.7 and 54.5-fold respectively upon liver IR conditions (Fig. 4C).

PARAGRAPH

In Nod1 KO mice, the NOD1-mediated induction of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression was blunted both following IR or a sham-operation (Fig. 4B,D).

SECTION

NOD1 activation in hepatocytes amplifies the interaction with PMNs and subsequent lysis

PARAGRAPH

Examination of the co-culture by electron microscopy revealed important adhesion of PMNs on hepatocytes which showed signs of distress such as swelling of mitochondria, cytoplasm clarification and lysosome (Fig. 5A).

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocytes isolated from Nod1 WT mice that were or were not treated with a NOD1 agonist showed low levels of spontaneous lysis when cultured alone (Fig. 5B).

A significant increase in LDH activity was observed when hepatocytes from untreated mice were co-cultured with PMN isolated from untreated WT mice.

When hepatocytes from NOD1 agonist-treated mice were co-cultured with PMN isolated from untreated WT mice, there was a significant increase in LDH activity compared to hepatocytes from vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 5B).

PARAGRAPH

To confirm the specificity of NOD1 in relation to this event, we reproduced these experiments with hepatocytes isolated from Nod1 KO mice treated or not with a NOD1 specific agonist.

As observed in Fig. 5C, targeting of Nod1 KO hepatocytes by PMN was reduced and NOD1 agonist-induced lysis was completely blunted.

SECTION

NOD1 signaling pathways driving ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in hepatocytes

PARAGRAPH

A liver active form of ERK (phospho ERK) was induced from 10 to 30 min after treatment with a NOD1 agonist (Fig. 6A).

A similar pattern was observed for p38 since active phospho p38 was induced at 10 and 30 min and then returned to the steady state 60 min after stimulation with a NOD1 agonist (Fig. 6B).

Treatment with the ERK inhibitor (U0126) significantly limited the increase in Icam-1 and significantly blocked the Vcam-1 mRNA overexpression induced by the NOD1 agonist (Fig. 6C-D).

The p38 inhibitor (SB203580) further blocked NOD1-induced hepatocyte Icam-1 and Vcam-1 mRNA expression.

Co-treatment with both ERK and p38 inhibitors did not increase blockade of the NOD1 effect.

PARAGRAPH

In vitro, we first cloned the human ICAM-1 promoter (Fig. 6E) and showed that NOD1 activation by an agonist resulted in a 50% increase in luciferase activity driven by this promoter compared to untreated cells (Fig. 6F).

SECTION

NOD1 antagonist development to prevent IR-induced liver injury

PARAGRAPH

ML130 and ALINO73 are 2 specific NOD1 inhibitors that have been identified by screening different libraries of chemical compounds for activation or inhibition of NOD receptors.20,21

In an in vitro model that allows evaluation of NOD1 activation, cells were treated with a NOD1 agonist and increasing doses of either ML130 or ALINO73 (Fig. S3A-B).

Treatment with a NOD1 agonist-induced significant expression of the reporter gene (SEAP, OD655 0.165 ± 0.014).

Addition of ML130 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in NOD1 activity from 0.16 µM (OD655 0.106 ± 0.014) to maximum inhibition at 5 µM (OD655 0.013 ± 0.014).

Treatment with ALINO73 led to dose-dependent inhibition of NOD1 activity from 0.16 µM (OD655 0.197 ± 0.020 vs. 0.140 ± 0.021) to maximum inhibition at 2.5 µM (OD655 0.030 ± 0.014).

PARAGRAPH

Because both NOD1 antagonists are not soluble in injectable vehicles used for in vivo applications, ML130 and ALINO73 were associated with PLGA nanoparticles to facilitate in vivo delivery to the liver.

PARAGRAPH

The effect of antagonist-loaded nanoparticles on NOD1 activity was tested in the same in vitro system as above (Fig. S3C-D).

As shown in Fig. S3C when ML130 was associated with PLGA nanoparticles, it lost its inhibitory potential on NOD1 activity, ALINO73-loaded nanoparticles (np ALINO) appeared to be at least as effective as free ALINO73 for the dose-dependent inhibition of NOD1 activity in vitro (Fig. S3D).

SECTION

Modulating IR-induced liver injury with NOD1 antagonist nanoparticles

PARAGRAPH

np ALINO was then used to test the in vivo potential of NOD1 antagonists.

Mice received an intravenous injection of nanoparticles that was either empty (np Empty) or loaded with the NOD1 inhibitor (np ALINO) before undergoing 1 h of ischemia.

As shown in Fig. 7A, mice treated with np Empty displayed large areas of IR-induced necrosis.

However, when treated with the np ALINO the area of necrosis was lower in mouse livers (26.0 ± 3.2% vs. 15.6 ± 2.9%, p = 0.038) (Fig. 7B-C).

These results were confirmed by determining serum aminotransferase.

After treatment with np ALINO, serum ALT significantly decreased compared to treatment with empty nanoparticles (3,935 ± 493 IU/L vs. 5,814 ± 615 IU/L, p = 0.040) (Fig. 7D).

This improvement was associated with a lower liver expression of KC mRNA and lower infiltration of PMNs into the liver parenchyma, whereas the PMN number in centrolobular vessels was unchanged (Fig. 7E–F).

The expression of ICAM-1 in the liver was reduced after treatment with np ALINO, as observed using immunohistochemistry (Fig. 7G).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

We have demonstrated in this study that the NOD1 pathway modulates liver IR injury through the induced expression of adhesion molecules.

These adhesion molecules are mainly ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 and are expressed on LSECs as well as on hepatocytes.

With an exploratory experiment using NOD1 antagonist-loaded nanoparticles, we strongly suggest that targeting NOD1 in vivo can reduce liver IR injury in part by reducing the expression of ICAM-1 in the liver.

PARAGRAPH

NOD1 has been previously shown to impact liver IR through increased CD11b expression in PMNs.18

However, the role of the NOD1 pathway in the liver, and more specifically the expression of adhesion molecules on hepatocytes and the endothelium was unknown.

Numerous studies have demonstrated the clear impact of adhesion molecules, especially on the endothelium for the regulation of histological lesions and PMN tissue infiltration.14,27,28

Our study emphasizes the role of NOD1 on adhesion molecule expression in the pathophysiology of liver IR.

Indeed, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression were increased upon NOD1 agonist treatment during liver IR.

This upregulation of adhesion molecules in the whole liver and hepatocytes occurred within the first hours of reperfusion, before necrosis and PMN infiltration.

This early expression of adhesion molecules is then probably a part of the first steps of pathophysiological mechanisms at the origin of reperfusion lesions.

PARAGRAPH

At a cellular level, and more precisely in the context of in vitro culture of endothelial cells, E-selectin in addition to ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 is largely expressed and modulated after NOD1 pathway activation.

However, the absence of significant induction of E-selectin expression after NOD1 activation at the whole organ level suggests that the endothelium is not the exclusive actor of expression of adhesion molecules in the liver.

The ex vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that hepatocytes are able to express ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 and these last are inducible upon NOD1 agonist treatment.

Other adhesion molecules (CD44, P-selectin, PECAM) have been screened on hepatocytes, but with no significant modulation of their expression by NOD1 agonist (data not shown).

PARAGRAPH

Although it is central, the PMN/hepatocyte interaction during IR has not been as extensively investigated as the PMN/endothelial interaction.

During warm/cold ischemia, endothelial tissue is injured,29 sinusoidal endothelial cells are detached and sloughed into the sinusoid lumen,30 allowing PMNs direct access to hepatocytes31,32 as confirmed by our analysis by electron microscopy (Fig. S4).

We then designed a co-culture experiment to model the PMN/hepatocyte interface and clarify the hepatocellular role of NOD1 activation in this interaction.

Electron microscopy analysis of our model confirmed the direct interaction between both cell types leading to hepatocyte death.

Quantification of LDH shows that activation of NOD1 in the hepatocyte increases hepatocellular death upon PMN binding.

The results of the interaction between Nod1 KO hepatocyte and PMNs suggest that blocking hepatocyte NOD1 could prevent PMN-induced hepatocyte death in vitro.

PARAGRAPH

In relation to the intracellular pathway, the effect of NOD1 appeared mediated through ERK and p38 phosphorylation in hepatocytes.

The regulatory effect of ERK and p38 inhibitors confirms the role of the MAPK pathway in NOD1-mediated ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression.

These findings support data obtained in other cell types such as PMNs.18,19

PARAGRAPH

NOD1 is expressed widely in many organs and cell types.33

The clinical potential of NOD1 antagonists could be extended to other organs such as renal IR pathogenesis34 or myocardium infarct.35

In the kidney, Nod1 deficient mice are partially protected from IR-induced kidney injury.

NOD1 activation by diaminopimelic acid worsens cardiac IR injury through p38 MAPK.

Nod1 knockdown using siRNA in cardiomyocytes attenuates cell death.

The role of NOD1 in innate immune cells suggests that NOD1 antagonists should be evaluated for sepsis36 or PMN-related hepatitis (i.e. alcoholic hepatitis).37–39

The present results can serve as a basis for future studies investigating the therapeutic potential of NOD1 antagonists.

PARAGRAPH

Our results and previous studies performed in the liver18,19 strongly support evaluating the proof of concept for the use of NOD1 antagonists to prevent liver IR injury.

Previous screening of chemical libraries on NOD receptors20 led us to choose 2 prototypic NOD1 inhibitors from 2 different chemical entities based on their optimal IC50: ML130 and ALINO73 with the greatest inhibitory effect (Fig. S3).

ML130 and ALINO73 are insoluble in aqueous solutions and insufficiently soluble in non-toxic hydrophobic solvents.

Because these low hydrophilic properties prevented their use in vivo, we used nanoparticles to transport insoluble NOD1 antagonists to the liver.40

We choose PLGA nanoparticles because of their high biocompatibility and FDA approved safety.

PLGA is currently used in several drugs such as: Sandostatin LAR© (USAN (United States Adopted Name): Octreotide)41 for neuroendocrine tumors, Bydureon© (USAN: Exenatide)42 in diabetes and Risperdal Consta© (USAN: Risperidone) in schizophrenia.43

PARAGRAPH

The in vitro testing of PLGA nanoparticles loaded with ML130 or ALINO73 showed that np ML130 was not effective while np ALINO inhibited NOD1 activity at least as efficiently as free ALINO73 suggesting a high bioavailability despite the PLGA integration.

In mice, this NOD1 antagonist-loaded nanoparticle, np ALINO, decreased the area of necrosis induced by liver IR by about 40%.

This decrease in histological lesions was associated with a 33% decrease in serum aminotransferase, supporting the potential role of np ALINO as a therapeutic approach to prevent liver IR.

The np ALINO treatment was also associated with lower KC mRNA expression in the liver, lower PMN infiltration and reduced ICAM expression.

The reduction of KC expression could have reduced the total number of PMNs recruited to the liver.

Indeed, np ALINO did not impact the number of PMNs in centrolobular vessels, but significantly reduced the severity of PMN infiltration in necrosis areas.

These results raise the therapeutic potential of NOD1 antagonists in preventing hepatic IR in humans.

The use of NOD1 antagonists should be tested during different steps of liver transplantation.

These NOD1 antagonists could be used either in the donor before the organs are harvested, or added to the preservation protocol, as well as a treatment during reperfusion in the recipient.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, this study states that NOD1 regulates adhesion molecule expression in the liver.

NOD1 activation and blockage experiments confirm that the NOD1 pathway modulates the severity of liver IR injury.

These data complement the impact of NOD1 on PMN function and migration.

Thus, NOD1 has a dual role and targets 2 different actors implicated in reperfusion injury.

However, the relative contribution of each actor (PMN or adhesion molecule) on liver IR injury is unclear.

New experiments are needed to puzzle out the full mechanism by which the NOD1 pathway exerts this effect.

This work supports the development of NOD1 inhibitors.
