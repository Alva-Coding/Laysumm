TITLE

Hepatocyte-derived extracellular vesicles promote endothelial inflammation and atherogenesis via microRNA-1

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition highly prevalent in obese and/or diabetic patients, is emerging as an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease.

Herein, we demonstrated that extracellular vesicles, released by hepatocytes under NAFLD conditions, cause vascular endothelial inflammation and promote atherosclerosis.

Within these toxic vesicles, we identified a small molecular cargo that acted as a potent inducer of endothelial inflammation.

By inhibiting this cargoâ€™s function, a specific gene-based inhibitor profoundly attenuated atherogenesis in mice, uncovering a novel mechanism which may be used to prevent or treat cardiovascular disease in patients with NAFLD.
