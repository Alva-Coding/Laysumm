TITLE

A cross-sectional study of the public health response to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in Europe

PARAGRAPH

We conducted a survey on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with experts in European countries, coupled with data extracted from official documents on policies, clinical guidelines, awareness, and monitoring.

We found a general lack of national policies, awareness campaigns and civil society involvement, and few epidemiological registries.
