ABSTRACT

TITLE

A simple diet- and chemical-induced murine NASH model with rapid progression of steatohepatitis, fibrosis and liver cancer

PARAGRAPH

Although the majority of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have only steatosis without progression, a sizeable fraction develop non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Many established diet-induced mouse models for NASH require 24–52 weeks, which makes testing for drug response costly and time consuming.

PARAGRAPH

We have sought to establish a murine NASH model with rapid progression of extensive fibrosis and HCC by using a western diet (WD), which is high-fat, high-fructose and high-cholesterol, combined with low weekly dose of intraperitoneal carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), which serves as an accelerator.

PARAGRAPH

C57BL/6J mice were fed a normal chow diet ± CCl4 or WD ± CCl4 for 12 and 24 weeks.

Addition of CCl4 exacerbated histological features of NASH, fibrosis, and tumor development induced by WD, which resulted in stage 3 fibrosis at 12 weeks and HCC development at 24 weeks.

Furthermore, whole liver transcriptomic analysis indicated that dysregulated molecular pathways in WD/CCl4 mice and immunologic features were similar to those of human NASH.

PARAGRAPH

Our mouse NASH model exhibits rapid progression of advanced fibrosis and HCC, and mimics histological, immunological and transcriptomic features of human NASH, suggesting that it will be a useful experimental tool for preclinical drug testing.
