TITLE

Comparison of extracellular and hepatobiliary MR contrast agents for the diagnosis of small HCCs

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Liver cancer is the second most frequent cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents about 90% of primary liver cancers [1].

The concept of imaging-based non-invasive diagnosis of HCC is part of both Western and Asian guidelines [1–5].

In Western guidelines, the diagnosis can be made in cirrhotic patients for nodules ≥ 1cm showing typical hallmarks on contrast-enhanced multiphasic imaging (computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) [1].

PARAGRAPH

In the past, CT or MR extracellular agents (ECAs) have been used.

Recently, hepatobiliary MR contrast agents (HBAs) have been included in all guidelines for the non-invasive diagnosis of HCC [1–4,6].

On hepatobiliary phase (HBP) images, the vast majority of HCCs display signal hypointensity compared to the surrounding liver parenchyma [7].

The weight and value of this feature differ significantly depending on the guidelines.

While part of the HCC hallmarks [2–4,8] is a major feature in Asian guidelines, Western ones consider it as an ancillary feature that favors malignancy when present, but is not sufficient to make a conclusive diagnosis of HCC [1,5].

PARAGRAPH

In recent years, HBA-MRI has been evaluated in many studies for the diagnosis of HCC showing higher sensitivity than ECA-MRI, especially when small, suggesting that for diagnosing HCC, HBA should be used upfront [2–4,7,9].

However, others were discordant and reported either a lower sensitivity due to poorer arterial phase quality using HBA [10] or a lower specificity with HBA [11].

However, these studies were not based on direct intra-individual comparisons of ECA-MRI and HBA-MRI (head-to-head nodule comparison).

PARAGRAPH

To our knowledge, only one study, has performed a prospective monocentric head-to-head comparison of ECA-MRI and HBA-MRI, using the Liver Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) [12].

This study suggested a superiority of ECA-MRI over HBA-MRI.

However, other non-invasive sets of criteria, e.g., that of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) were not included.

Therefore, the comparison of the diagnostic performance of MRI using ECA or HBA, and the criteria to be used for HBA-MRI, remain to be determined in Western populations for the non-invasive diagnosis of HCC.

PARAGRAPH

We hypothesize that HBA-MRI has better diagnostic accuracies for the non-invasive diagnostic of small HCCs, due to its hepatobiliary phase.

The aim of the current study was to prospectively compare the performance of ECA-MRI and HBA-MRI for the non-invasive diagnosis of small HCCs according to the EASL criteria in a large multicentric trial.

SECTION

Materials and Methods

PARAGRAPH

The study was approved by a national Ethics committee and registered as NCT00848952.

All patients gave written informed consent.

This study was supported by French ministry of health grant (PHRC 2008-01).

Full study protocol is available at the research department of Angers University Hospital (Angers, France).

SECTION

Patients

PARAGRAPH

From August 2014 to October 2017, 189 consecutive patients with 284 nodules were prospectively enrolled in eight university hospital centers.

All of them are referral centers in HCC diagnosis and treatment.

The inclusion criteria were: patients with compensated cirrhosis undergoing surveillance with a de novo liver nodule sized between 10 and 30 mm found on ultrasound (US), CT or MRI.

A maximum of three nodules were accepted for each patient.

The patient could be either naïve of HCC or have already been treated for an HCC by surgery or percutaneous ablation techniques (radiofrequency (RF) or microwave (MW)).

Exclusion criteria were nodules located close to or less than 2 cm from a previous treated nodule and previous transarterial chemoembolization.

Patients were identified in the radiology or hepatology department of each center.

Patients underwent both ECA-MRI and HBA-MRI.

PARAGRAPH

Among these 189 patients and 284 nodules, 59 nodules were excluded for several reasons (Figure 2): 1) incomplete MRI examination: for one nodule, the arterial phase on the ECA-MRI was not performed and for two nodules, the delayed phases on the ECA-MRI were not performed.

The lack of theses sequences was confirmed by a second centralized reading; 2) absence of a final diagnosis following the gold standard algorithm (see below) because i) only one conclusive contrast-enhanced imaging technique was available with no histology and treated by ablation before the six-month follow-up (14 nodules), or ii) treatment during the follow-up revealed no positive diagnosis on histology and no typical imaging of HCC on two dynamic imaging techniques (11 nodules), or iii) no follow-up was performed until six months later (31 nodules).

Therefore, 225 nodules were analyzed in 171 patients.

SECTION

Imaging

PARAGRAPH

All patients underwent both ECA-MRI and HBA-MRI within a month.

CT and CEUS (contrast-enhanced ultrasounds) were also performed for clinical routine check-ups within a month in 168 and 166 patients respectively, and were used as part of the method of reference.

The CT and CEUS protocols are described in Supplementary Material 1.

PARAGRAPH

MRI studies were performed either on a 3.0T (3 centers) or 1.5T (7 centers) clinical scanner.

A routine MRI protocol was performed for all patients including: a fat-suppressed fast spine echo (FSE) T2-weighted imaging, a diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) using at least two b-values of 0 and ≥ 600 s/mms2, a breath-hold and opposed-phase T1-weighted gradient-echo (GRE) sequence, a fat-suppressed imaging T1-weighted GRE sequence during a single breath-hold with unenhanced, arterial phase (AP), portal venous phase (PVP), delayed phase (DP)/transitional phase (TP), and for HBA-MRI a hepatobiliary phase (HBP).

AP was acquired 7-8 s after the contrast agent’s arrival in the descending aorta, with a single or multi-arterial acquisition; PVP 70-90 s; DP/TP at 3 min, and HBP at 20 min.

The contrast agent and saline were injected with a power injector at a rate of 2 mL/s for the extracellular agent (ECA) and 1 mL/s for HBA (Gd-EOB-DTPA, Primovist, Bayer HealthCare, Berlin, Germany).

SECTION

Imaging analysis

PARAGRAPH

For each imaging modality (CT, MRI or CEUS), a senior radiologist performed the image analysis blinded to the other modalities and histology results.

The following features were assessed for each nodule: surrounding steatosis, localization according to the Couinaud classification, size (in mm), arterial phase enhancement, signal intensity on PVP and DP/TP, and signal intensity on HBP for HBA-MRI.

Enhancement patterns are reported in Supplementary Material 2.

All examinations were analyzed using a workstation and recorded on a picture archiving and communication system.

Image subtraction was systematically performed in contrast-enhanced sequences, and used when a nodule showed spontaneously signal hyperintensity on precontrast T1-weighed images.

SECTION

Histology

PARAGRAPH

In the study design, the histology of all nodules was recommended in all patients and mandatory when typical imaging hallmarks of HCC were not met.

Liver transplantation and surgical resection of the nodules were performed according to EASL guidelines.

Technical details of the biopsy and histology analyses are reported in Supplementary Material 3.

SECTION

Algorithm for the final diagnosis

PARAGRAPH

The algorithm was based on previous studies already published [13,14] that aim to closely reflect daily practice.

This is a step-by-step algorithm built to reach the highest possible specificity and to classify nodules as “HCC” or “not HCC”.

The algorithm is presented in Figure 1 and described in Supplementary Material 4.

Assessors of the algorithm were blinded to clinical, histological and imaging results.

SECTION

Statistics

PARAGRAPH

For sample size calculation, the alpha error was set at 0.05 and statistical power at 0.95.

The rate of correct HCC diagnosis with ECA-MRI and HBA-MRI was anticipated to be 75% and 90%, respectively.

Assuming a 5% dropout rate, the number of patients to be included was 170.

Data were reported as mean and standard deviations and range (for continuous variables), and count and frequency (for categorical variables).

Two analyses were performed: one analysis using the method of reference based on a step-by-step algorithm, and then analyses using histology as the only reference method (step 1+2 of the algorithm).

The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV) and diagnostic accuracy of ECA-MRI and HBA-MRI were calculated, as well as their 95% confidence intervals.

The comparison of diagnostic performances was performed using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM), more specifically a logistic mixed model, to take into consideration the intra and inter patient correlation.

Subgroup analyses were conducted for small (10-19 mm) and larger HCCs (20-30 mm).

In addition, an analysis was performed to evaluate and compare the diagnostic performances of multi-arterial and single-arterial vascular phases using also the GLMM.

Analysis was performed to assess the influence of steatosis on the diagnostic performance of ECA and HBA-MRI.

Comparison was made using also the GLMM.

A p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Statistical analyses were performed on SPSS, version 15.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).

Patients and nodules

PARAGRAPH

A flow chart of the study is shown in Figure 2.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 225 nodules were analyzed in 171 patients.

145 (85%) patients were men; the mean age was 66.2 ± 8.9 y/o.

The etiology of liver disease was alcohol in 105 (61%) patients, hepatitis C in 47 (27%) and metabolic syndrome in 54 (32%).

The patients’ characteristics are presented in Table 1.

All patients were included in a context of cirrhosis undergoing regular imaging surveillance according to EASL guidelines.

Due to history of nodule previously depicted, to history of HCC or to ultrasound limitation various imaging methods were used for surveillance, and depiction of the nodules was as follows: 63 (28%) nodules depicted by CT, 75 (33%) nodules depicted by US, 78 (35%) nodules depicted by MRI, and four nodules diagnosed after serum AFP increase (blood test performed between 2 imaging surveillances).

125 (73%) patients had a single nodule, 38 (22%) had two and 8 (5%) had three.

The mean size of the nodule was 17.3±5.9 mm.

154 nodules (98 HCC) measured 10 – 19 mm and 71 (55 HCC) measured 20 – 30 mm.

PARAGRAPH

The mean time delay between ECA and HBA-MRI was 15.9±19.6 days.

There was no clinical intervention between both MRI.

The main characteristics of the 153 HCCs according to the ECA-MRI and HBA-MRI are shown in Table 2.

APHE (arterial phase hyperenhancement) and enhancing capsule visualization were more frequently depicted with ECA-MRI than with HBA-MRI, 138 (90.2%) and 128 (83.7%) (p=0.097), and 82 (53.6%) and 50 (32.7%) (p<0.001) respectively.

SECTION

Performance of ECA-MRI

PARAGRAPH

Considering the classical imaging hallmarks, APHE followed by wash-out (WO) on PVP and/or DP, 121/225 nodules were classified as HCCs.

The sensitivity and specificity of the ECA-MRI was 71.2% and 83.3%, respectively (Table 3).

There were 12 false positive nodules (9 on histology, 3 on follow-up), detailed in Table 3.

Using only histology as the diagnostic reference, 80/137 nodules were classified as HCCs.

The sensitivity was quite similar (69.6%) but the specificity was lower (74.3%) (Table 4), probably because biopsies were performed for less typical HCCs.

The 9 false positive cases were detailed above.

SECTION

Performance of ECA-MRI

PARAGRAPH

Considering the classic imaging hallmarks, APHE followed by wash-out (WO) on PVP and/or DP, the sensitivity and specificity of the ECA-MRI were 71.4% and 85.7% respectively for 10-19 mm nodules and 70.9% and 75.0% respectively for 20-30 mm nodules.

SECTION

Performance of HBA-MRI

PARAGRAPH

APHE and WO on PVP and/or TP and/or HBP (Korean guidelines 2018)

PARAGRAPH

The sensitivity of ECA-MRI and HBA-MRI was not statistically different (p=0.375) for 10-19 mm nodules but specificity was significantly higher with ECA (p=0.020) at 85.7% and 66.1% respectively.

In contrast, there was no difference in the diagnostic performance for 20-30 mm nodules with similar specificity for ECA-MRI and HBA-MRI at 75.0% (p=1.000) and not statistically different in sensitivity (p=0.828).

PARAGRAPH

APHE and WO on PVP and/or HBP (JSH Consensus-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Hepatocellular Carcinoma 2014, Asia–Pacific clinical practice guidelines 2017)

PARAGRAPH

The sensitivity of ECA-MRI and HBA-MRI was similar (p=1.000) for 10-19 mm nodules but specificity was significantly higher with ECA at 85.7% and 66.1% (p=0.020) respectively.

Again, there was no difference in the diagnostic performance for 20-30 mm nodules with similar sensitivity and specificity for ECA-MRI and HBA-MRI at 70.9% and 75.0%, respectively (p=1.000).

PARAGRAPH

APHE and WO on PVP only (EASL guidelines 2018)

PARAGRAPH

The sensitivity of ECA-MRI was higher than HBA-MRI for 10-19 mm nodules at 71.4% and 42.9% (p<0.001) respectively, but specificity was not statistically different (85.7% and 83.9%, p=0.700).

The sensitivity of ECA-MRI was also higher than HBA-MRI for 20-30 mm nodules with 70.9% and 52.7% (p=0.043) respectively with no statistic difference in specificity (p=0.479).

SECTION

Performance regarding the multi-arterial or single-arterial phase:

PARAGRAPH

Ninety-four nodules were analyzed with multi-arterial and 130 with single-arterial phase acquisition.

One patient had an HBA-MRI with multi-arterial phase acquisition and an ECA-MRI with mono-arterial phase acquisition, so this patient was excluded from analysis.

PARAGRAPH

The use multi-arterial phase technique increased the proportion of arterial phase hyperenhanced HCC for both ECA and HBA MRI, but with a larger proportion for HBA MRI (87.8% to 92.8% [p = 0.746], and 76.8% to 91.4% [p = 0.559], respectively).

This resulted in a significantly higher sensitivity for HBA-MRI when using multi-arterial phase acquisition (Supplementary Materials Table 3 and 4).

SECTION

Performance according to the presence of steatosis:

PARAGRAPH

Steatosis was not evaluable for three patients (one nodule each) because of a marked hepatic iron overload (n=2), and of a missing sequence (n=1).

Of the 222 remaining nodules, 73 (33%) were developed in patients with steatosis detected on MRI, and 149 were not.

There was no statistically significant influence of steatosis on diagnostic performances of both ECA-MRI and HBA-MRI (Supplementary Material Table 5).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this prospective multicentric study, we show that ECA-MRI outperforms HBA-MRI for the diagnosis of small HCCs, whatever the criteria used with HBA.

Using criteria proposed by Eastern guidelines (including hypointensity on the hepatobiliary phase), sensitivities were similar with ECA and HBA-MRI, while specificity was much lower with HBA-MRI.

Indeed, the lower specificity is problematic as a major goal of non-invasive diagnosis is to maintain a high specificity, allowing conclusive diagnosis of HCC on imaging.

Using more restrictive criteria as proposed by EASL and AASLD (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases) (limiting wash-out to the portal venous phase), we can confirm that specificity is high and similar with ECA and HBA-MRI.

However, the sensitivity of HBA-MRI drops below 50% of the cases, which is not acceptable.

Results are similar in the histologically confirmed nodules, which represent 61% of all analyzed nodules.

PARAGRAPH

The size of the nodules does not influence the sensitivity of either ECA or HBA-MRI, but for the largest nodules (20-30 mm), the specificity is higher using HBA-MRI.

Indeed, for this group of nodules, diagnostic accuracy is equivalent for both contrast agents.

PARAGRAPH

The poorer results obtained with HBA-MRI, especially for the smallest nodules, are explained by three factors: i) lower depiction of APHE on HAP with HBA.

This has been demonstrated well using quantitative data and could be attributed to the lower concentration of gadolinium chelates (one-quarter of that of conventional ECA (0.025 mmol/kg vs. 0.1 mmol/kg) [15,16], the rate of injection [17], and the higher prevalence of artifacts on HBA-MRI [10]; ii) lower depiction of wash-out on PVP HBA-MRI compared to ECA-MRI, which could be related to the decreased percentage of enhancement of the adjacent liver parenchyma with HBA-MRI (reducing tumor to liver contrast) [18,19]; iii) low specificity of lesion hypointensity on the HB phase.

The latter is well known as all non-hepatocellular tumors lack OATP (organic anion transporting polypeptide) transporters and therefore appear hypointense on the HB phase.

In our study, of the 16 false positive cases with HBA-MRI, 6 were cholangiocarcinomas or hepatocholangiocarcinomas.

PARAGRAPH

The first two explanations (low detection of APHE and washout) could be influenced by steatosis related to the high proportion of alcoholic in our study population.

We assessed the possible influence of steatosis on diagnostic performance and do not found any statistical difference for diagnostic performances between nodules with surrounding steatosis or not.

This is probably explained by the fat suppression technique used for multiphasic contrast-enhanced sequences that minimizes the effect of steatosis.

Nevertheless, in case of steatosis, we recommended using image subtraction especially for APHE evaluation.

PARAGRAPH

Some adjustment could be done to overcome the low depiction of APHE on AP with HBA.

First, the use of multi-arterial phase imaging improved the depiction of APHE with HBA-MRI.

In the present study it allowed to detect APHE in 91.4% of the HCC instead of 76.8% when using single arterial phase.

Therefore, this technique significantly improved the sensitivity of HBA-MRI for the diagnosis of HCC and should be recommended.

Second, subtraction imaging (subtracting non-enhanced image from arterial phase image) for depicting APHE could be systematically used.

Finally, although it is not yet included in international standards, the use of APHE depicted on a recent CT scanner has been suggested to compensate for a missing APHE on the HBA-MRI.

Indeed, such combination of features extracted from different imaging modalities must be evaluated.

PARAGRAPH

Surprisingly, when considering hypointensity on the TP as one of the imaging features (APHE and WO on PVP and/or TP and/or HBP), as recommended by the Korean Guidelines, the specificity was not altered and the sensitivity increased, compared to those recommended by the Asian Pacific Association for the study of the Liver (APASL) or the JSH guidelines (APHE and WO on PVP and/or HBP).

As gadoxetic acid begins to be taken up by hepatocytes 60 to 90 seconds after contrast agent administration, we could have anticipated more false positive cases [20].

However, the new Korean guidelines have shown on a large retrospective cohort that it does not affect specificity.

By the way we confirm the recent finding of Kim et al. showing that extending washout appearance to the transitional or hepatobiliary phase (instead of restricting it to the portal venous phase) allowed higher sensitivity without a reduction in specificity [21].

Nevertheless, the specificity is much lower than that obtained with ECA-MRI.

PARAGRAPH

Our results are in line with the only head-to-head comparison between ECA-MRI and HBA-MRI, showing a better diagnostic performance with ECA-MRI [12].

Nevertheless, sensitivities and specificities are different in the two studies, with a higher sensitivity and lower specificity in ours.

This is explained by important differences that should be highlighted.

First, our patient population is different, as in the study by Min et al. [12], most patients had chronic hepatitis B and all were resected, whereas our top three etiologies were alcohol misuse, metabolic syndrome and hepatitis C. Only 16.0% of nodules (36/225) were resected in our series.

Consequently, our prevalence of HCC vs. non-HCC (68% vs. 32%) lesions reflects clinical practice more closely and is similar to previous studies [13,22,23].

Second, Min et al. used the LI-RADS classification, while we use the new EASL guidelines.

With ECA-MRI, the diagnostic performance of LI-RADS 5 and EASL criteria has been shown to be similar [14].

We could even expect a lower diagnostic performance of HBA-MRI with the LI-RADS classification as the enhancing capsule, which is part of the diagnostic criteria in LI-RADS, was seen significantly less often on HBA-MRI.

This finding has already been reported [16,24].

Recently, another study has prospectively evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of EOB-MRI in small, newly detected nodules and has shown disappointing results for EOB-MRI compared to ECA-MRI, but the study design is different from ours as it was not designed to compare both techniques head-to-head [25].

PARAGRAPH

Indeed, HBA-MRI also has advantages in patients with chronic liver diseases.

HBA-MRI has a high sensitivity in lesion detection, which is of particular value in patients considered to have a single HCC [26].

Moreover, non-APHE nodules that are hypointense on the HB phase have a higher risk of progressing to typical HCCs [27].

PARAGRAPH

Our study has some limitations: First, a histological gold standard was not available in all patients.

However, histological reference for all nodules is not recommended anymore and would not be ethical.

As such, we have built a step-by-step algorithm that maximizes specificity.

Moreover, results were similar in histologically confirmed nodules.

Second, we used MRI as part of the method of reference, when histology was not available.

It is always crucial to use an evaluated technique as part of the refence method.

On the other hand, we also minimized the bias by using other imaging modalities such as CT and CEUS.

We also took care not to favor one MRI technique over another.

Another limit of our study was that 37 nodules were diagnosed as being ‘not-HCC’ based on at least 6 months follow-up.

The possibility of false negative cases cannot be completely ruled-out.

Yet, 30 of them were followed between 9 to 12 months, and only three nodules were diagnosed as HCC.

Finally, imaging reading was not centralized, which could lead to a potential decrease of diagnostic performance.

This choice was made to reflect clinical practice, taking into account the fact that all centers were referral centers.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, ECA-MRI outperforms HBA-MRI for the non-invasive diagnosis of small HCCs, in particular for 1-2 cm HCCs.

The use of multi-arterial phase improves the sensitivity of both ECA and HBA-MRI, but to a greater extent for HBA-MRI.

We believe that these results are important and may change clinical practice.
