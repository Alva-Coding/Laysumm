TITLE

Comparison of extracellular and hepatobiliary MR contrast agents for the diagnosis of small HCCs

PARAGRAPH

There are 2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based approaches available for the non-invasive diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), using either extracellular or hepatobiliary contrast agents.

The current results showed that the sensitivity of MRI with hepatobiliary contrast agents was similar to that with extracellular contrast agents, but the specificity was lower.

Thus, hepatobiliary contrast agent-based MRI, although detailed in international guidelines, should be used with caution for the non-invasive diagnosis of HCC.
