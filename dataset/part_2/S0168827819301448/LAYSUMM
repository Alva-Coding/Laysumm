TITLE

F-actin dynamics regulates mammalian organ growth and cell fate maintenance

PARAGRAPH

The mechanical properties of cells and tissues (i.e. whether they are soft or stiff) are thought to be important regulators of cell behavior.

Herein, we found that inactivation of the protein CAPZ alters the mechanical properties of cells and liver tissues, leading to YAP hyperactivation.

In turn, this profoundly alters liver physiology, causing organ overgrowth, defects in liver cell differentiation and metabolism.

These results reveal a previously uncharacterized role for mechanical signals in the maintenance of adult liver homeostasis
