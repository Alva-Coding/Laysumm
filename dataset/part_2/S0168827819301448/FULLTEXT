TITLE

F-actin dynamics regulates mammalian organ growth and cell fate maintenance

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Cell behavior is powerfully regulated by the mechanical properties of the microenvironment.

For example, seminal studies indicated that extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and the resulting cell geometry can drive the choice between proliferation, cell death or differentiation, often dominating soluble cues and oncogenes.1–7

The current model explaining these observations is that cells probe the physical properties of the microenvironment by exerting contractile forces on adhesion complexes generated by their actomyosin cytoskeleton.8–12

In turn, actomyosin contractility regulates intracellular signaling pathways to regulate cell behavior.

PARAGRAPH

Several biochemical pathways respond to mechanical cues.

Among them, Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ or WWTR1) are required mediators of multiple biological responses dictated in vitro by mechanical cues and actomyosin contractility.13–15

YAP/TAZ function as transcriptional coactivators together with the TEAD family of transcription factors, and their activity is regulated by upstream inputs including the Hippo cascade, centered on the LATS1/2 kinases.16,17

In vivo, the function of YAP and of YAP-regulatory inputs has been studied with great detail in the liver tissue, where YAP activation leads to hallmark phenotypes.18–29

PARAGRAPH

Despite the increasing array of techniques to measure the mechanical properties of cells and tissues,30 a question that remains largely unanswered is whether mechanotransduction and the control of F-actin dynamics is really at work in controlling adult tissue and organ homeostasis, and whether it does so through YAP or other pathways.

Available functional data suggest a role for CAPZ as a negative regulator of YAP activity, and as one factor capable of regulating the response of mammary epithelial cells to ECM stiffness in vitro.32,41,42

Yet, how regulation of actin assembly dynamics at the filament barbed end by CAPZ31 is sufficient to trigger those phenotypes remains unknown.

By genetic inactivation in mice, we identified an unexpected role for CAPZ in regulating cell contractility and tissue stiffness.

This is relevant in adult hepatocytes to restrain YAP activity, such that CAPZ inactivation in the liver leads to organ overgrowth, hepatocyte dedifferentiation and alteration of physiological liver metabolic functions.

These phenotypes can be rescued by inhibition of cell contractility and by inactivation of YAP, thus unveiling a role for mechanotransduction in regulating organ size and tissue homeostasis.

Mice and treatments

PARAGRAPH

Capzbtm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi EM:04820 (EUCOMM/EMMA repository) mice were maintained in the C57BL/6 N strain.

Yap1fl/fl and ROSA26-LSL-LacZ mice were kindly provided by Dr. Pan.

Mice were kept in standard cages with a limit of 5 mice per cage, with ad libitum feeding at an average temperature of 19–24 °C.

Gender was random.

Animal experiments were performed according to our institutional guidelines as approved by the University Animal Welfare Commission (OPBA) and authorized by the Ministry of Health (945/2015-PR and 54/2015-PR).

Reporting was according to the ARRIVE guidelines.

PARAGRAPH

The neo and lacZ cassettes in the targeted allele (Fig. S1A) were removed by crossing with the CMV-FLP deleter line, generating Capzbfl/fl mice.

Subsequent crossings were performed to obtain Albumin-CRE-ERT2; Capzbfl/fl; ROSA26-LSL-lacZ mice (hereafter Capz LKO).

Mice received 5 consecutive daily i.p. injections of tamoxifen starting at 4–6 weeks of age and were analyzed after 1 month.

Control mice were mice of the same genotype but injected with corn oil only, or age-matched littermates without the CRE transgene and induced with tamoxifen.

Crossing with the CAGG-CRE deleter was used to obtain Capzb+/- mice, which were born at the expected mendelian ratio.

Crossing of Capzb+/- mice did not produce any viable Capzb-/- offspring (not shown, but significant by chi-square test).

Mice with liver specific knockout (LKO) of Yap1 were Albumin-CRE-ERT2; Yap1fl/fl; Wwtr1fl/fl; ROSA26-LSL-lacZ (hereafter Yap1 LKO).

PARAGRAPH

For genotyping, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane to surgically remove the tail tip.

Genomic DNA was extracted with NaOH at 95 °C for 30 min, followed by Tris-base pH = 8 neutralization.

DNA was diluted in water and used for PCR with the following pairs of oligos: Capzb-floxed: CAP 71+84; Capzb-null: CAP 71+48; Yap1-floxed: P1+P2; Yap1-null: P1+P3.

Primer sequences are provided in the CTAT table.

Antibodies, western blotting and staining

PARAGRAPH

Antibodies are provided in the CTAT table for immunofluorescence on liver sections, OCT-embedded tissue was cut into 5–8 µm thick sections with a Leica CM1950 cryostat.

Sections were dried at RT for 30 min on a glass coverslip (VWR), and either stored dried at −80 °C or directly processed by rehydration in 1×PBS followed by fixation in 4% PFA for 15 min.

Permeabilization was performed in 1xPBS-Triton 1% for 20 min.

Blocking was done with 10% goat serum in 1xPBS-Triton 0.5% for 1 h at RT.

Cytokeratin 19 (CK19 or KRT19)-positive area was quantified by measuring the proportion of CK19-positive pixels over the total number of pixels, by using binary thresholded pictures (ImageJ).

For phalloidin staining, Alexa Fluor-conjugated phalloidin (Thermofisher) was incubated with secondary antibody in blocking buffer.

For histological analysis, paraffin-embedded liver tissue was cut into 5 µm sections and stained with hematoxylin-eosin for histologic examination or with Picrosirius Red to visualize fibrosis (commercial kits and protocols).

For EdU labelling, mice were injected with 12.5 mg/kg of EdU in sterile 1xPBS (A10044 Molecular Probes) 15 h before tissue sampling.

Cells were incubated for 1 h with EdU prior to fixation.

Liver slice or cells were fixed in PFA 4% and blocked/permeabilized for 30 min in 1×PBS 3% BSA + 0.2% Triton (1% Triton for liver slices).

EdU reaction mix (100 mM Tris pH 8.5, 4 mM CuSO4, 625 nM Alexa Azide, 100 mM Ascorbic acid) was incubated for 30 min, and staining with other antibodies or DAPI was then performed as described above.

Cell lines

PARAGRAPH

Primary mouse adult fibroblasts (MAFs) were obtained by standard procedures after enzymatic digestion of the tail tip and plated in DMEM + 20% FBS, 1% Gln, Pen/Strep.

MAFs were kept in a low-oxygen (5%) incubator to prevent stress-induced senescence.

Subsequent manipulations and experiments were performed in a standard incubator.

Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination (ATCC Kit).

Plasmid DNA (GFP-actin, mCherry-vinculin) was electroporated according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Viral infections (Adeno-empty UIowa-272 and Adeno-CRE UIowa-5) were carried out following standard procedures and protocols.

SECTION

Microfabrications

PARAGRAPH

Substrates were made of polyacrylamide (PAA), polymerized on standard 25 mm glass coverslips.

(3-Aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane was applied to the glass surface for 3 min, followed by washes with ddH2O, and treatment with 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 min.

A pre-mixed solution was made of 500 µl 40% acrylamide, 65 µl 100% hydroxy-acrylamide and 250 µl 2% bis-acrylamide (Bis-AA, Fisher scientific), and diluted in PBS to obtain the desired stiffness.

After 15 min de-gassing, tetramethylethylenediamine and ammonium persulfate were added to initiate the cross-linking, and 50 µl of the solution was immediately pipetted onto the coverslips.

A plasma-cleaned coverslip made hydrophobic with RainX (Kraco Car Care International Ltd.) was lowered onto the drop to ensure even thickness; this was later covered with PBS and removed.

The gels were washed in PBS and sterilized under UV light.

Gels were treated with 100 µg/ml poly-d-lysine overnight, and then with fibronectin for 1 h to promote cell adhesion.

All chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise stated.

Micropatterned glass slides13 were from Cytoo SA (PADO-1 custom mask, available to all users upon request).

For each slide, 80,000 cells were plated in a 6-well plate dish containing a single slide, and non-adherent cells were washed with medium after 2 h.

SECTION

Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching

PARAGRAPH

MAFs were re-seeded on glass-bottom dishes (Matek, Sigma-Aldrich) coated with 10 µg/ml of fibronectin 24 h after transfection (mCherry-vinculin or GFP-actin), and imaged in Ringer’s phenol-red free medium upon complete spreading with a Confocal Spinning Disk microscope (Olympus) equipped with a 100×/1.35Sil silicone oil immersion objective, a iXon897 Ultra camera (ANDOR) and a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) module equipped with a 405 nm laser.

Environmental control was maintained with an OKOlab incubator.

Circular regions of interest (ROI) of 2 µm diameter were photo-bleached at 50% intensity for actin and 100% intensity for vinculin, and post-bleaching images were followed with 15 to 20% laser intensity for 100 frames (1 frame every second for actin, 1 frame every 0.5 seconds for vinculin).

FRAP data were analyzed as reported37 and curves fitted to a monoexponential recovery equation by the Graphpad Prism software: I = I0 + Imax * [1 − e−(k)*(t)].

Where I is the relative intensity compared to the pre-bleaching value, k represents the association rate constant, and t is expressed in seconds.

SECTION

Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy

PARAGRAPH

Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy of MAFs was performed using a DMI6000B equipped with AM TIRF module (Leica).

Images were acquired using either a PlanApoN 60x1.45-NA or UApoN 100x1.49-NA TIRF oil-immersion objective, captured using an Ixon+ electron multiplying CCD (EMCCD) camera (Andor).

All images were acquired with the same camera settings and laser intensity for consistent image analysis.

A custom macro, available upon request, was designed to quantify the number and size of focal adhesions per cell.

Images containing a single cell were background-subtracted and a binary mask was created by applying non-linear filters.

The mask was then applied on raw images to obtain particle sizes and area.

Only particle sizes >200 nm2 were considered in the analysis, as this avoided analysis of background particles.

All images were acquired with the same settings and consistently analyzed by concatenating all images, while saturated images were discarded.

SECTION

Traction force microscopy

PARAGRAPH

Preparation of PAA substrates.

PAA gels were prepared on imaging dishes (µ-Dish, Ibidi, Germany) as previously described.38

Fluorescent nanoparticles (FluoSpheres carboxylate, 0.2 µm, crimson, Life Technologies, UK) were added to the PAA pre-mixes, which were then placed in an ultrasonic bath for 30 s to separate the beads.

After starting polymerization, the imaging dish was inverted to ensure that beads settled close to the gel surface.

PARAGRAPH

Time lapse imaging for traction force microscopy (TFM).

MAFs were seeded onto PAA gels with shear storage moduli G′ of 1 kPa (‘soft’) and 10 kPa (‘stiff’).

After 24 h, cells where imaged using an inverted microscope (Leica DMi8) at 37 °C and 5% CO2, equipped with a digital sCMOS camera (ORCA-Flash4.0, Hamamatsu Photonics), an EL6000 illuminator (Leica, Germany), and a 63× oil objective (NA1.4, Leica, Germany).

Images were acquired using Leica LAS X software.

Fluorescence images of beads, and widefield images of cells were taken every 2 min.

After image acquisition, culture media were exchanged with Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco) to detach cells from the gel.

Reference images of fluorescent beads were taken 15 min after trypsinization.

Three independent traction force experiments were performed for each condition.

PARAGRAPH

Data analysis for TFM.

Traction stress maps were calculated for each frame using a TFM Software Package in ImageJ.39

To minimize noise, regularization parameters of 0.01 and 0.00001 were chosen for cells on 1 kPa and 10 kPa PAA gels, respectively.

Traction stresses were averaged over time for each cell.

Post-processing of the data and statistical analyses were done with a custom Python script.

The distributions of the average stresses were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests.

SECTION

Atomic force microscopy

PARAGRAPH

All atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments were performed in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.

Mice were sacrificed via an approved schedule 1 method.

Livers were immediately dissected and embedded in low melting point agarose (4% in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich).

A small block of agarose containing the sample was submerged in chilled PBS and cut into 500 µm thick sections using a vibratome (Leica).

Sections were slowly heated to 37 °C in PBS for 30 min prior to AFM measurements.

AFM measurements were carried out similarly to the method previously described.40

Monodisperse polystyrene beads (radius r = 18.64 µm ± 0.17 µm, microParticles GmbH, Berlin, Germany) were glued to tipless silicon cantilevers (spring constants between 0.01 and 0.03 N/m; Arrow-TL1, NanoWorld, Neuchatel, Switzerland).

The AFM was mounted on an x/y motorized stage of an inverted microscope (AxioObserver A1, Zeiss, Cambridge, UK).

Cantilever position relative to the liver sections was monitored via a CCD camera (The Imaging Source, Bremen, Germany) placed on top of the AFM setup.

Force-distance curves were taken with a set force of 10 nN with an approach speed of 10 µm/s.

Apparent elastic moduli K were calculated using the Hertz model: F = 4/3 K r1/2 δ3/2 for an indentation depth δ = 2 µm, using a custom written automated algorithm based in Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, USA).

Stiffness was measured in maps over defined sample areas, over which multiple force-distance curves were taken at 20 µm steps (each map containing 40–200 measurements, 2–3 maps per liver).

The median measurement stiffness for each map was calculated, and statistical significance between maps was determined using a 2-tailed Student’s t test.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Data analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software.

Graphs indicate mean values and single values of all biological replicates (or mice), unless otherwise indicated.

Data for each mouse are derived from analysis of multiple (n ≥6) tissue sections.

To facilitate gene expression data visualization, the mean expression levels in WT mice were set equal to 1, and all other data (single values, means and errors) are relative to this.

Significance was calculated by applying unpaired Mann-Whitney U tests (n = 3 samples) or Student’s t tests (n ≥4 samples); for RNA sequencing, we considered as significant only genes with p <0.05.

Results

SECTION

Derivation and validation of a Capzb-floxed allele

PARAGRAPH

To functionally dissect the role of mechanotransduction and F-actin dynamics in vivo, we chose to inactivate the F-actin capping protein CAPZ.

CAPZ is a dimer whose alpha subunit is encoded by 2 loci in mammals (Capza1 and Capza2), while the beta subunit is encoded by only 1 gene (Capzb – Gene ID: 12345), facilitating genetic analysis.

We thus recombined the Capzbtm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi allele to obtain Capzbfl/fl mice (see Methods and Fig. S1A-B); the same allele was recently used in Ref.41 We validated this allele by monitoring efficient depletion of the endogenous CAPZB protein in primary adult Capzbfl/fl fibroblasts recombined by adenoviral-CRE infection (Fig. S1C).

Moreover, adenoviral-CRE recombination of primary newborn Capzbfl/fl cardiomyocytes led to a rapid disassembly of contractile actomyosin structures (Fig. S1D), in line with the role of CAPZ in muscle sarcomeres.31

We speculate this defect might underlie the lethality of Capzb−/− embryos (see methods).

PARAGRAPH

We also aimed at specifically validating the role of CAPZ in the context of mechanotransduction.

For this we compared the biological response of WT (Capzbfl/fl + adeno-control) and Capz KO (Capzbfl/fl + adeno-Cre) primary adult fibroblasts (MAFs) to mechanical cues: WT MAFs respond to a small cell geometry, which is associated with decreased actomyosin contractility,42 by inactivating YAP/TAZ and by decreasing proliferation (Fig. 1A and B), in line with Ref.;13,14 in contrast, Capz KO MAFs retained nuclear YAP and kept proliferating, at least to a certain extent (Fig. 1A and B).

As a control, Capz KO MAFs completely detached from the substratum that maintains YAP nuclear exclusion (not shown).

Thus, Capzb is required in MAFs for the inhibition of YAP in conditions of decreased contractility.

SECTION

Capzb limits actomyosin contractility in response to ECM mechanical cues

PARAGRAPH

We then sought to understand at what level CAPZ acts to regulate mechanotransduction.

We analyzed F-actin and focal adhesions (FAs) in WT and Capz KO MAFs, as these are critically involved in cell mechanics.

Phalloidin staining on fixed cells indicated thinner and denser bundles in Capz KO MAFs (Fig. 1C).

FRAP analysis of actin dynamics in stress fibers indicated a faster recovery in Capz KO cells (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1E), and thus a faster actin turnover previously associated with higher levels of Myosin-II activity.43,44

Analysis of vinculin dynamics in FAs indicated a slower recovery in Capz KO cells (Fig. 1E and Fig. S1F), and thus more stable vinculin, a typical feature observed upon increased pulling forces or upon stiffening of the ECM.45–48

This was associated with a higher number of vinculin-positive FAs, but of smaller size (Fig. 1F-G and Fig. S1G).

During these analyses we noted a redistribution of FAs from a predominantly peripheral to a more central position, perhaps reminiscent of the recently described perinuclear FAs which were specifically associated with increased tension and YAP activity;49 to quantify this phenotype we plated MAFs on cross-bow shaped fibronectin micropatterns and averaged the intensity of the staining over several stacked cells,50,51 confirming our observation (Fig. 1H).

Furthermore, Capz KO MAFs display increased levels of active S19-phosphorylated myosin light chain (pMLC – Fig. S1H) and increased cellular forces on stiff hydrogels (G′ = 10 kPa), as measured by traction force microscopy (Fig. 1I).

Finally, we extended these findings in the context of a soft ECM microenvironment, where CAPZ inactivation is relevant to regulate YAP/TAZ:52 pMLC staining was almost undetectable in MAFs on soft hydrogels (G′ = 1 kPa), but clearly visible in Capz KO MAFs (Fig. 1J).

Moreover, Capz KO MAFs exerted significantly higher forces on their substratum in this condition compared to control cells (Fig. 1K).

Collectively, these data indicate that deletion of Capzb enables the development of higher cellular forces even in conditions of decreased extracellular resistance, unveiling a previously unsuspected role for CAPZ.

Moreover, this validates Capzb inactivation as a meaningful tool to modulate F-actin dynamics and cell mechanics in vivo.

SECTION

Conditional inactivation of Capzb in hepatocytes activates the YAP mechanotransducer

PARAGRAPH

To probe the role of Capzb as a regulator of tissue physiology we focused on the liver, because hepatocytes are inherently mechanosensitive1,53 and because it is a model system for Hippo/YAP.54–56

We thus obtained Capz LKO, wherein Capzb was deleted in adult hepatocytes in a time-controlled manner, enabling the lineage tracing of recombined cells by β-galactosidase expression (Fig. 2A, Fig. S2A and B).

PARAGRAPH

We initially sought to find evidence for activation of the YAP mechanotransducer in Capz LKOs.

We monitored a series of established YAP target genes in the liver tissue,18,26 and found them upregulated in Capzb-null livers (Fig. 2B).

Similarly, we performed a more global analysis of gene expression and found that genes activated in Capz LKOs are remarkably overlapping with those activated in Hippo-mutants26,28,57 and Yap1-transgenics18,20,58 (Fig. 2C).

Prompted by these results, we directly monitored endogenous YAP localization by immunofluorescence, and found increased nuclear localization in Capzb-null hepatocytes (Fig. 2D and Fig. S2H).

Of note, mutant liver tissues also display an overall increase in YAP staining intensity (Fig. 2E).

SECTION

Control of liver organ size by inactivation of Capzb

PARAGRAPH

Phenotypically, inactivation of Capzb caused an evident hepatomegaly reaching on average 200% of the normal liver/body weight ratio (Fig. 2F).

Hepatocytes appeared enlarged, similarly observations in Lats1/2 knockouts26 (see Fig. S2A), and exhibited a stark increase in proliferation as measured by EdU incorporation (i.e. S-phase) and phospho-Histone3 (i.e. mitosis) staining (Fig. 2G and H and Fig. S2C).

This was accompanied by overexpression of several proliferation markers (Fig. 2I), including known direct YAP targets,58,59 and of antiapoptotic genes (Fig. S2D).

As a control, we excluded major alterations of cell-cell junctions (Fig. S2E), previously observed by Capz inactivation in flies,60 fibrosis (see Fig. S2A) and inflammation (Fig. S2F and G).

This indicated that CAPZ is required in adult hepatocytes to keep control over a key mechanotransduction pathway, and that it potently restrains hepatocyte proliferation.

SECTION

Capzb controls liver cell fate

PARAGRAPH

Activation of YAP in hepatocytes leads to expansion of atypical ductal cells (ADCs)/oval cells/biliary epithelial cells that display bipotent progenitor identity.20,23

Analysis of Capz LKO livers indicated a massive expansion of A6- and CK19-positive ADCs forming disorganized strands in the liver parenchyma, mainly distributed around the portal area (Fig. 3A), and this was accompanied by increased expression of cholangiocyte/progenitor markers20,61 in Capz LKO livers (Fig. 3B).

Appearance of ADCs upon YAP activation has been attributed to dedifferentiation of hepatocytes, with appearance of cells double-positive for CK19 and HNF4α (markers for the cholangiocyte and hepatocyte lineages, respectively),20 which we also found in Capz LKO livers (Fig. 3C).

Moreover, in keeping with a role for Notch in regulating hepatocyte dedifferentiation,20,62 we found the Notch pathway activated in Capz LKO livers (Fig. 3D and E).

To unequivocally trace ADCs to hepatocytes bearing Capzb deletion, we performed a double staining for β-galactosidase (which labels recombined hepatocytes) and CK19, and found co-localization (Fig. 3F).

Of note, this indicated dedifferentiation of hepatocytes also at a distance from the portal area.

As an alternative approach, we expressed a Cre transgene in hepatocytes of Capzbfl/fl mice by hydrodynamic tail vein transposon DNA injection,63 which caused appearance of cells doubly positive for CK19 and β-galactosidase (Fig. 3G).

This indicates a cell-autonomous function of Capzb.

More generally, these data indicate that Capzb inactivation is sufficient to reprogram adult hepatocyte fate.

SECTION

Capzb controls hepatocyte zonation and liver metabolism

PARAGRAPH

Metabolism in the liver parenchyma is zonated, with hepatocytes expressing different metabolic genes along the periportal to pericentral axis of the hepatic lobules in response to several signaling cues.64–66

Recent evidence indicates that YAP activity contributes to zonation by inhibiting pericentral gene expression.28

We thus checked for expression of established pericentral markers in Capz LKO livers and found them strikingly reduced both at the mRNA level (Fig. 4A) and by immunostaining (Fig. 4B and C).

Pericentral zonation is particularly evident if looking at the expression of cytochromes involved in xenobiotic metabolism.66,67

Among these we focused our attention on Cyp1A2 and Cyp2E1, the main genetic determinants of APAP toxicity in the mouse,68 which we found strongly inhibited (see Fig. 4A).

Reflecting decreased expression, we then found that Capz LKO were extremely resistant to APAP intoxication: at sub-lethal doses (350 mg/kg) sufficient to cause extensive cell death (as measured by TUNEL assay) and extensive hepatic damage (as measured by serum ALT) in WT mice, Capz LKO mice remained insensitive (Fig. 4D-F).

PARAGRAPH

Another recently reported function of YAP in the liver is the regulation of gluconeogenesis and blood glucose homeostasis.29

Accordingly, we found decreased expression of key gluconeogenic genes in Capz LKO mice (Fig. 4G), and this was functionally linked to decreased steady-state blood glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance (Fig. 4H).

Overall, these data indicate that Capzb is relevant to maintain the physiological patterning of hepatocyte differentiation and of key metabolic traits in the liver.

SECTION

Capzb regulates liver homeostasis through YAP

PARAGRAPH

To obtain formal evidence that phenotypes observed upon Capzb inactivation are due to YAP activation, and not to other mechanoresponsive pathways, we deleted Yap122 in Capz LKOs (Albumin-CreERT2; Capzbfl/fl; Yap1fl/fl; ROSA26-LSL-lacZ mice, Capz+Yap1 LKO).

As shown in Fig. 5A-E and Fig. S3A, Yap1 inactivation partially rescued hepatomegaly and proliferation, while it almost completely rescued atypical ductal cell expansion, pericentral expression, and glucose tolerance.

We speculate the partial rescue might depend on TAZ, which is functional in hepatocytes69 and sufficient to induce hepatocyte proliferation (see Fig. 5G).

This would also imply that the phenotypes described above require different thresholds of YAP/TAZ activity.

Thus, the control of F-actin assembly dynamics is a physiologically-relevant input to keep control over YAP/TAZ activity in the liver.

SECTION

Capzb regulates YAP/TAZ in parallel to Hippo

PARAGRAPH

Some data suggest that mechanical regulation of YAP/TAZ involve YAP phosphorylation by LATS kinases; functional data however indicate that mechanical regulation of YAP/TAZ can occur in the absence of LATS1/2.15

The effectiveness of Capzb inactivation in regulating YAP/TAZ in hepatocytes offered us the opportunity to test the genetic interaction with Lats1/2 in vivo.

We thus expressed in the liver, by hydrodynamic tail vein transposon injection, the CAS9 enzyme and guide-RNAs targeting Lats1 and Lats2,32 to inactivate Lats1/2 without inducing liver failure caused by whole-organ knockout.26,70

CRISPR inactivation of Lats1/2 induced multiple Yap1-dependent phenotypes (Fig. S3B-D), indicating efficient recombination of both genes.26,32,71,72,83

We then found that the combination of Capzb and Lats1/2 inactivation induced a higher number of proliferating cells compared to Lats1/2 inactivation alone (Fig. 5F and Fig. S3E), ruling out the possibility that CAPZ works only through LATS1/2 to regulate YAP.

We also injected a transposon plasmid encoding TAZ-4SA (a TAZ isoform that cannot be phosphorylated and inhibited by LATS kinases) and obtained a comparable cooperation with Capzb deletion (Fig. 5G and Fig. S3F).

Overall this indicates that regulation of YAP/TAZ by actin assembly dynamics regulates YAP in parallel to the Hippo cascade in liver tissue.13,52,73,74

SECTION

Capzb regulates liver homeostasis by controlling tissue mechanics

PARAGRAPH

Data gathered so far indicate that Capzb regulates cellular forces in vitro, and the activity of a key mechanotransduction pathway in vivo.

We then sought to test the idea that CAPZ also regulates tissue mechanical properties in vivo.

For this we monitored F-actin and MLC phosphorylation75 and found them increased in Capz LKO liver tissue compared to the controls (Fig. 6A).

Importantly, this was associated with increased tissue stiffness, which can be an indirect readout of actomyosin contractility in cells,76 as measured by AFM (Fig. 6B).

Moreover, target genes that are inhibited in hepatocytes subjected to high stiffness1,53 are downregulated in Capz LKO livers (Fig. 6C), further supporting the view that CAPZ regulates the cell’s mechanical properties.

To functionally validate these findings, we inhibited ROCK activity in Capz LKO mice, which efficiently reduced MLC phosphorylation (Fig. 6D), and scored YAP-dependent phenotypes.

As shown in Fig. 6E-G, hallmark phenotypes induced by Capzb deletion, including expression of direct YAP target genes, were inhibited by fasudil treatment.

Altogether, these data indicate a function of Capzb in restraining tissue tension, and a physiological role for tissue tension in regulating hepatocyte homeostasis.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Here we found that inactivation of the capping protein Capzb induced increased cell tension and tissue stiffness, and enabled pMLC activity in soft environments which would normally suppress it, including the liver.53

Capzb inactivation induced liver overgrowth, hepatocyte dedifferentiation and repatterning of liver metabolism, which all depend on the YAP mechanotransduction pathway.

These phenotypes were similar in strength, and overlapping by gene expression analyses, with published liver mutants of the Hippo pathway, and can be readily seen by inactivating Capzb in adult hepatocytes.

We also found that Capzb and Hippo inactivation cooperate to drive hepatocyte proliferation, genetically supporting the view that mechanical signals regulate YAP/TAZ through both LATS-dependent77 and LATS-independent mechanisms.78,79

This makes CAPZ the only genetically-validated YAP/TAZ regulator from flies80,81 to mammals besides the Hippo pathway.

We did not find evidence for a mechanical activation of β-catenin though,82 because zonation defects are compatible, if anything, with inhibited β-catenin.64

PARAGRAPH

Our results suggest that capping of the F-actin barbed end is crucial to regulate cell mechanics in vitro and in vivo, and a required determinant of adult liver homeostasis.

The phenotypes observed in Capzb-null livers were stable up to 30 weeks (not shown), suggesting that the novel function that we describe here for CAPZ cannot be easily compensated, and that CAPZ plays a prominent role in regulating cell and tissue mechanotransduction.

These results highlight the interesting possibility that CAPZ levels and activity are regulated in tissues, eventually contributing to pattern cell mechanics, YAP/TAZ and perhaps other mechanotransduction pathways.

The existence of a whole family of CAPZ-regulatory proteins and the known, but so far poorly addressed, role of phosphoinositides as regulators of CAPZ31 represent a possible basis to better understand how CAPZ activity, and by association F-actin assembly dynamics, are involved in the signaling mechanisms that maintain tissue homeostasis.
