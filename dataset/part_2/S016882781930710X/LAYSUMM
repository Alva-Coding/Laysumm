TITLE

Progress and Challenges in a Pioneering Hepatitis C Elimination Program in the Country of Georgia, 2015â€“2018

PARAGRAPH

This report describes progress in Georgia's hepatitis C elimination program and highlights efforts to promote hepatitis C virus screening and treatment initiation on a national scale.

Georgia has made progress towards eliminating hepatitis C, treating over 50,000 people, approximately one-third of the number infected, and achieving cure for 98.5% of those tested.

However, identifying infected individuals and linking them to care remains challenging.

Novel approaches to increase diagnostic testing can have unintended consequences further down the care cascade.
