ABSTRACT

TITLE

Blood metabolomics uncovers inflammation-associated mitochondrial dysfunction as a potential mechanism underlying ACLF

PARAGRAPH

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), which develops in patients with cirrhosis, is characterized by intense systemic inflammation and organ failure(s).

Because systemic inflammation is energetically expensive, its metabolic costs may result in organ dysfunction/failure.

Therefore, we aimed to analyze blood metabolome in patients with cirrhosis, with and without ACLF.

PARAGRAPH

We performed untargeted metabolomics using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry in serum from 650 patients with AD (acute decompensation of cirrhosis, without ACLF), 181 with ACLF, 43 with compensated cirrhosis, and 29 healthy subjects.

PARAGRAPH

Of the 137 annotated metabolites identified, 100 were increased in patients with ACLF of any grade, relative to those with AD, and 38 composed a distinctive blood metabolite fingerprint for ACLF.

Among patients with ACLF, the intensity of the fingerprint increased across ACLF grades, and was similar in patients with kidney failure and in those without, indicating that the fingerprint reflected not only decreased kidney excretion but also altered cell metabolism.

The higher the ACLF-associated fingerprint intensity, the higher plasma levels of inflammatory markers, tumor necrosis factor α, soluble CD206, and soluble CD163.

ACLF was characterized by intense proteolysis and lipolysis; amino acid catabolism; extra-mitochondrial glucose metabolism through glycolysis, pentose phosphate, and D-glucuronate pathways; depressed mitochondrial ATP-producing fatty acid β-oxidation; and extra-mitochondrial amino acid metabolism giving rise to metabolites which are metabotoxins.

PARAGRAPH

In ACLF, intense systemic inflammation is associated with blood metabolite accumulation witnessing profound alterations in major metabolic pathways, in particular inhibition in mitochondrial energy production, which may contribute to the existence of organ failures.
