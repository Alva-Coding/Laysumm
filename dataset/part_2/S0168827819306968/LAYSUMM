TITLE

Blood metabolomics uncovers inflammation-associated mitochondrial dysfunction as a potential mechanism underlying ACLF

PARAGRAPH

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), which develops in patients with cirrhosis, is characterized by intense systemic inflammation and organ failure(s).

Because systemic inflammation is energetically expensive, its metabolic costs may result in organ dysfunction/failure.

We identified a 38-metabolite blood fingerprint specific for ACLF that revealed mitochondrial dysfunction in peripheral organs.

This may contribute to organ failures.
