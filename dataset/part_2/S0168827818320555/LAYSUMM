TITLE

Normal on-treatment ALT during antiviral treatment is associated with a lower risk of hepatic events in patients with chronic hepatitis B

PARAGRAPH

We investigated 21,182 patients with chronic hepatitis B receiving antiviral treatment.

Alanine aminotransferase is a laboratory marker of liver function, with raised levels indicating liver dysfunction and in severe cases hepatitis.

Normal on-treatment alanine aminotransferase during the first year of treatment in patients with CHB is associated with a lower risk of hepatic events.
