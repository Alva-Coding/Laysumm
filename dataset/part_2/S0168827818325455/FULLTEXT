TITLE

Epidemiology and natural history of hepatitis C virus infection among children and young people

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global health burden with an estimated prevalence varying between 0.6%–10% dependent on geographical location and an estimated 71 million people worldwide with chronic infection.1–3

In Western Europe, the estimated prevalence is 1.5%–3.5%, but in the UK it is 0.5%.

Chronic HCV is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and is a leading cause of end-stage liver disease, cirrhosis and liver cancer worldwide.3–6

Although HCV infection rarely contributes to morbidity during childhood, the majority of HCV-infected children develop chronic HCV with a lifetime risk of serious liver disease.7

Furthermore, some studies indicate that HCV affects childhood quality of life and behaviour, as cognitive function has been shown to be affected and families report increased stress which affects family dynamics and wellbeing.7,8

PARAGRAPH

Several factors have been associated with accelerated disease progression, but it is not clear whether or not infection in early life carries a different risk of progressive disease than infection in adulthood.9,10

Since the mode of infection and genotype differs between countries and regions, knowledge of epidemiology at a local level is important in order to effectively plan prevention, surveillance, and prioritise treatment.11

Currently, there are few data on mode of infection, genotype and development of long-term liver disease in patients infected with HCV in childhood in the UK.

PARAGRAPH

Currently, access to clinical trials of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in childhood is limited which denies timely access to effective therapies for young infected children.

HCV Research UK is a UK database and biobank which established a cohort of HCV-infected children and adults to address gaps in knowledge of epidemiology, treatment, disease progression, and prognosis.12,13

PARAGRAPH

The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology and natural history of HCV in a UK cohort of patients who were infected during childhood.

SECTION

Patients and methods

PARAGRAPH

This was a retrospective, descriptive study of patients infected with HCV in childhood in the UK.

SECTION

The HCV Research UK database and biobank

PARAGRAPH

HCV Research UK is a national, clinical, multicentre research database and biobank set up in 2012 to collect information about adults and children infected with HCV in the UK.12,13

All highly populated areas of the UK are represented in the cohort and only patients who were in prison at time of clinic appointments or patients who were unable to give written informed consent were excluded from recruitment.

More than 10,000 patients with past or current infection have been enrolled from 51 specialist adult and 7 paediatric HCV centres.

Written informed consent was obtained at time of enrolment.

For children under 16 years, this was supplied by parents or legal guardians.

The HCV Research UK database holds anonymised information including demographic data, risk factors for HCV infection including date of first exposure to risk, past and current alcohol intake, virology data, laboratory data, biopsy and imaging results.13

The baseline data at enrolment of each participant is collected through a detailed, standardised questionnaire while follow-up data is collected through assessment of medical notes.

In addition, prospective clinical data on risk behaviours, physical characteristics, HCV virology, comorbidities, liver disease status, treatment, and mortality are collected biennially for all patients in the cohort.

PARAGRAPH

Diagnosis of cirrhosis was made at the discretion of the local physician by histology, imaging studies, serum markers or clinical diagnosis with accompanying clinical signs (ascites, portal hypertension, and/or variceal bleed).

SECTION

Patients

PARAGRAPH

Clinical and epidemiological data from patients enrolled in the HCV Research UK clinical database and biobank was requested in October 2016 and the data updated in March 2017.

Patients were included if age at first infection was estimated (based on first exposure to risk) to be between 0–18 years or if age between 0–18 years was recorded at the time of first positive HCV test, the time of first attendance or at the time of consent.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 13 (StataCorp LP, Texas).

Clinical characteristics were analysed in a descriptive way and reported as mean ± SD or median and range where assumptions of normal distribution were not met.

For pairwise comparison, chi-square test was used for binary outcome variables and Fisher exact test was used for small samples.

PARAGRAPH

The unpaired t test and multivariate logistic regression with indicator variable was used for continuous numerical outcome variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for non-normally distributed data.

Statistical significance was defined as p <0.05.

SECTION

Results

SECTION

Demographic data

PARAGRAPH

In total, 1,086 patients infected with HCV in childhood were identified from the HCV Research UK database of whom 37 patients were excluded due to discrepancies between date of birth, date of infection and possible infection route leaving 1,049 patients for data analysis.

The estimated time of first infection between 0 and 18 years was given in 984/1,049 (94%) of patients, while the remaining 65 patients were included based on age <18 years at their first positive HCV test (n = 64) or their age at consent <18 years (n = 1).

Baseline characteristics of the cohort are provided (Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

HCV genotypes, tested in 938 patients (89%), were G1: 531 (57%); G2: 50 (5%); G3: 328 (35%), G4: 27 (3%), G5: 1 (0.1%) and mixed type: 1 (0.1%).

Forty-four (4%) patients were coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) of whom 41 (93%) were treated with antiretrovirals; 363 (35%) had a history of heavy alcohol use, 301/759 (40%) males and 62/287 (22%) females, p < 0.001.

Spontaneous clearance of infection was seen in 3% (36/1,049), of whom 26 (72%) were males.

SECTION

Route of infection

PARAGRAPH

Patient characteristics by mode of infection are provided (Table 2).

The most prevalent route of infection was intravenous drug use (IVD group): 560 (53%), followed by receipt of blood products (blood group): 251 (24%), including 85 with coagulation bleeding disorders; perinatal exposure (perinatal group): 119 (11%) and unknown or other route of infection (unknown group): 119 (11%).

There were less male patients in the perinatal group (35%) compared to the IVD blood and other infection route groups (78%, 77% and 73% respectively, p < 0.001).

The genotype distribution shows fewer genotype 3 infections in the blood group (18%) compared to the other 3 groups (35%) (p < 0.001).

PARAGRAPH

Median age at first infection was 16 years (range 10–18) in the IVD group, 11 years (range 0–17) in the blood group and at birth (0 years) in the perinatal group (Fig. 1).

The gap between infection and diagnosis was a median 19 to 24 years in the IVD group, blood group and unknown risk group and 2 years in the perinatal group.

SECTION

Development of liver disease

PARAGRAPH

In total, 334/1,049 (32%) of patients had a diagnosis of cirrhosis at the time of data analysis.

Cirrhosis was diagnosed by liver biopsy (110, 33%), imaging studies including transient elastography (85, 25%), endoscopy or clinical signs of cirrhosis (101, 30%), serum markers (7, 2%) and unknown/missing (31, 9%).

By multivariate regression analysis, significant risk factors for the development of cirrhosis were male gender (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2–2.2; p = 0.003) and heavy alcohol use (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2–2.8; p < 0.001) while HIV coinfection was not significant (OR 0.95; 95% CI −0.2 to 0.5; p = 0.88).

The time to cirrhosis and age at development of liver disease between the different risk groups is presented, showing that the rate of liver disease progression appears to be similar across all patient groups (Fig. 2).

PARAGRAPH

The median time to develop cirrhosis was 33 years (range 12–53) which was estimated in 281/334 (84%) patients.

There was no significant difference between any of the groups (IVD group: 33 years; blood group: 32 years; perinatal group 36 years; unknown group: 36 years; p = 0.76).

Thus, patients with perinatal infection developed cirrhosis earlier at a median age of 36 years (range 17–53) compared to 48 years (range 33–68), 46 years (range 12–61), and 51.5 years (range 12–65) in the IVD, blood, and unknown groups, respectively (p < 0.001).

PARAGRAPH

There were less patients with cirrhosis in the perinatal group (8%, 10/119) compared to the IVD, blood and unknown groups (37%, 205/560; 32%, 79/250; 34%, 40/119) (p < 0.001).

However, 101 (85%) patients with perinatal infection were younger than 33 years of age at the time of data analysis and so may not have had time to develop cirrhosis, whilst 7 of the 18 (38%) above the age of 33 years had developed cirrhosis, suggesting a similar pattern of development of cirrhosis irrespective of infection route.

Cirrhosis developed in the perinatal group despite the low prevalence of associated risk factors (male gender, heavy alcohol use) compared to the IVD group (Table 2).

PARAGRAPH

HCC was diagnosed in 55/1,049 (5%) of the patients.

Of these 55 patients 38/55 (70%) were from the IVD group, 11/55 (20%) in the blood product group, and 6/55 (10%) of the patients in the unknown group.

Of the 55 patients with HCC, 44 (80%) had cirrhosis prior to the diagnosis of HCC.

There was no difference in heavy alcohol use between patients with (23/44, 52%) or without cirrhosis (6/11, 55%), p = 0.9 prior to diagnosis of HCC.

Overall, median time to development of HCC was 39 years (range 23–53) while median age at diagnosis of HCC was 55 years (range 37–68) (Fig. 3).

PARAGRAPH

A total of 46 (4%) patients received a liver transplant (LTx).

Of these, 33 were cirrhotic and 17 had HCC at the time of transplant.

Median time to LTx from first infection was 34 years (range 16–50) while the median age at the time of LTx was 49 years (range 27–66) (Fig. 4).

There was no significant effect of mode of transmission for either median time to LTx or median age at the time of LTx (p = 0.90 and p = 0.18, respectively).

There was no difference between those who required LTx and those who did not with regard to HIV coinfection (2/47 (4%) vs. 42/1,002 (4%), p = 0.2) or history of heavy alcohol use (21/47 (44%) vs. 342/1002 (34%), p = 0.1).

Renal failure was reported more frequently in patients who had LTx (4/47 (9%) vs. 7/1,002 (0.7%), p = 0.001).

PARAGRAPH

The overall mortality in the cohort was 3% (28/1,049).

In multivariate analysis the presence of cirrhosis (OR 6.2; 95% CI 2.6–14.7; p < 0.001) was the only significant risk factor.

Heavy alcohol use (OR 1.5; 95% CI 0.7–3.3; p = 0.3), HCC (OR 1.2; 95% CI 0.4–3.9; p = 0.8), gender (OR 1.6; 95% CI 0.5–3.3; p = 0.8) and LTx (OR 1.0; 95% CI 0.3–3.7; p = 0.9) were not associated with mortality.

SECTION

Treatment

PARAGRAPH

In total 663 (63%) patients in the cohort had received treatment, 133 and 46 of whom received 2 and 3 separate treatment regimens, respectively.

Treatment outcome was missing for 122 individuals.

Of the 541 patients whose treatment outcome was known, 292 (54%) received an interferon (IFN)-based treatment regimen + ribavirin (RBV), only 6 patients (1%) received IFN alone, 95 (18%) received IFN in combination with DAAs and 119 (22%) received DAAs alone.

In 29 (5%) patients, the treatment regimen was unknown, mostly because they had taken part in clinical trials.

Overall, sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved in 406 (75%) patients while 135 (25%) patients were non-responders or responder-relapsers.

Treatment outcomes stratified by the last regimen received and liver disease status are shown in Table 3.

There was no difference in the overall SVR rates between non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic patients (265/360 [74%] vs. 111/142 [78%]; p = 0.29), although this is confounded by the fact that 314/360 (87%) of the former group received an INF-containing regimen, whilst 67/142 (47%) of the latter group received all DAA regimens.

The apparently higher SVR rate in cirrhotic patients treated with an interferon-based regimen (32/46, 70%) compared to non-cirrhotic patients (162/238, 68%) was probably caused by the predominance of genotype 3 in the former group (28/46, 61%), as genotype 3 generally responds better to IFN therapies.

In the latter group, genotype 1 infections were the most common (115/238, 48%), with only 97 (40%) genotype 3 infections.

SECTION

Progression of liver disease

PARAGRAPH

A total of 502 patients underwent treatment with complete data (i.e. the treatment regimen, outcome and liver disease status were known [142 with cirrhosis and 360 patients without]).

The progression of liver disease according to treatment outcome in patients with and without cirrhosis is shown in Table 4.

PARAGRAPH

Disease progression occurred in 87/502 (17%); 47/360 (13%) events were recorded in those without cirrhosis, compared to 40/142 (28%) in patients with cirrhosis (p <0.001).

Progression to cirrhosis was seen in 24/265 (9%) patients, who achieved SVR, compared to 15/95 (16%) who failed to achieve an SVR (p = 0.07).

Progression to HCC, liver transplant or death was seen almost exclusively in those patients who were cirrhotic at treatment onset.

Although HCC developed in 16 cirrhotic patients post-SVR, in 12 of these patients, the HCC was diagnosed in the same year that SVR was recorded.

It is highly likely, therefore, that many, if not all of these tumours did not arise de novo post-SVR in a non-infected liver, but were present during the period of therapy and follow-up to assessment of treatment outcome.

PARAGRAPH

The median length of follow-up for the cirrhotic patients, without further liver disease at time of data analysis was 3 years for those with SVR (range 0–20) and 3 years (range 1–13) for non-SVR patients.

For the non-cirrhotic patients, the follow-up time was 5 years (range 1–24) for SVR patients and 6 years (range 1–22) for non-SVR patients.

PARAGRAPH

Significantly more patients with SVR treated with cirrhosis compared to patients treated before diagnosis of cirrhosis progressed to HCC (16 [14%] vs. 2 [1%]; p <0.001) or required LTx (7 [6%] vs. 3 [1%]; p = 0.005) or died (5 [4%] vs. 0 [0%]; p = 0.001) (Table 4).

Furthermore, mortality amongst cirrhotic patients who achieved SVR (5/111, 4%) was significantly less than for those who did not achieve SVR (7/31, 23%, p = 0.004).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

This is the first study to describe the epidemiological characteristics and development of long-term liver disease in a UK cohort of patients infected with HCV in childhood.

The main route of infection was IV drug use in adolescents in the UK.

Serious long-term liver disease developed in one-third of the patients and treatment was more effective in those who were treated before cirrhosis developed, as those treated with cirrhosis were more likely to develop HCC, require liver transplantation, or die.

Studies of the development of liver disease in adult patients with chronic HCV prior to treatment have found that alcohol intake and severity of portal fibrosis are correlated with future disease progression and development of cancer.14

There are few studies describing disease progression in adulthood in patients who were infected with HCV during childhood.

Many studies are in heterogeneous populations with insufficient long-term follow-up to provide clear outcomes.14–17

Previous studies have reported that HCV infection in children differs from adults in some ways such as modes of transmission, rates of clearance, progression of fibrosis, and the duration of potential chronic infection when acquired at birth.18,19

A risk of the development of hepatic fibrosis whilst in childhood of less than 2% has been reported, but this is much higher in patients with longer follow-up and duration of infection, indicating disease progression is more likely 10 years after the onset of infection.20–23

Other paediatric studies have demonstrated that the degree of hepatic fibrosis correlates with age and duration of infection and suggest that progression occurs at a slower pace in young children compared to those infected late in life.16,24–27

Liver disease may progress more rapidly in older patients because of the presence of multiple additional risk factors such as alcohol consumption and coinfection with HIV, and therefore it is important to distinguish between disease development in those infected as neonates and young people vs. disease development in young adults.18,28–30

PARAGRAPH

The proportion of HCV-infected children who may develop serious long-term liver disease is not clear from the current literature.

In this study 33% of patients infected with HCV in childhood developed long-term liver disease including cirrhosis, HCC or a requirement for LTx.

A critical finding in our analysis was that the long-term development of progressive liver disease is independent of the age or route of acquisition, with a median time to diagnosis of 32–36 years.

Other studies have suggested that vertically infected children may develop liver disease more frequently than children infected by blood products.31–33

However, most of these studies do not have data beyond 10 years of follow-up of children infected with HCV and are likely to underestimate the proportion of HCV-infected children who will develop long-term liver disease.

Cirrhosis was less frequent in perinatally infected patients compared to the other risk groups in our cohort.

However, perinatally infected patients older than 33 years in our cohort had the same frequency of cirrhosis as the other risk groups, even though heavy alcohol use was much less frequent in this subgroup.

PARAGRAPH

The rate of disease progression is influenced by a variety of host, viral, and environmental factors, most notably alcohol abuse and coinfection with hepatitis B virus and HIV.2,34

Such associations were not evident in our cohort, most likely because of the relatively low frequency of these risk factors in those children infected at an early age.

PARAGRAPH

There was more than a 20 year delay between suspected time of infection and diagnosis of HCV in this cohort, except in the perinatally infected patients, probably because of lack of HCV testing in relevant paediatric risk groups.9

As all blood donors are now screened for all blood borne viruses, vertical transmission of HCV via mother-to-child transmission is now reported to be the leading cause of paediatric infection globally while risk factors for HCV infection in adults include IVD use, blood transfusion before 1992 and HIV-infection.35–38

PARAGRAPH

In this cohort, in contrast to other paediatric studies, more than half of the infected patients reported IV drug use in adolescence as the main route of infection, followed by blood product exposure, while vertical transmission only accounted for 11% of the cases.39,40

These data reflect the long-term follow-up of this cohort infected with HCV prior to screening of blood products and modern management of IV drug abuse.41,42

These data may be an underestimate of the actual number of UK children infected with HCV as it is likely that many are not identified and hence are not receiving appropriate treatment and counselling.

Healthcare workers at primary and secondary healthcare levels should encourage testing of relevant risk groups, such as young adolescents who participate in IV drug use and the children of such individuals.

PARAGRAPH

Of the patients treated in this cohort, 75% achieved SVR.

Life-threatening complications of end-stage liver disease were much less frequent in patients treated before they became cirrhotic (see Table 4) as reported previously in the literature.43,44

PARAGRAPH

We have not attempted a more detailed interpretation of the treatment data in this cohort since the data were collected during a period when there were rapid changes in HCV treatment regimens and there are a number of possible confounders.

For instance, many of the patients treated with DAAs will be those who had failed earlier treatment regimens and will thus have been a “difficult-to-treat” group, with potentially more severe liver disease at time of initiation of treatment.

Nevertheless, our data provide a clear indication of the need to start treatment as early as possible before the development of established liver disease.

We have confirmed previous reports that achievement of SVR in patients with cirrhosis reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of HCC development.32,33,45

PARAGRAPH

Some limitations should be considered when interpreting the results.

The duration of infection was estimated on the assumption that patients were infected at the time of first exposure to risk.

For the IVD group, this is a simplification since it is possible that actual infection occurred sometime later in life.

Calculations based on the risk of infection in IVD users suggest that around 50% of all IVD users who acquire HCV infection do so within 3 years of onset of injecting behaviour.46

Thus, our quoted estimate of time to cirrhosis for this group may be a slight overestimate.

PARAGRAPH

Treatment data from this cohort reflects historical practice as IFN-based treatment regimens are no longer recommended in adult guidelines and DAAs are the preferred treatment with high SVR rates and few side-effects.

However, only 2 DAAS are licensed in children over 12 years of age (sofosbuvir with ribavirin and sofosbuvir/ledipasvir).

Although clinical trials of DAAs are ongoing in children under 12 years, there will be a delay until they are licensed.11

PARAGRAPH

It is likely that we have not enrolled all children with HCV infection in the UK and so there may be selection bias in recruitment of patients who attended specialist clinics, who may have had more severe liver disease.47

However, we believe the cohort is representative of patients with HCV infection attending specialist treatment centres and therefore an assessment of the long-term outcome of HCV infection in this population.

The strengths and limitations of the HCV Research UK cohort are described in more detail elsewhere.13

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, HCV infection in childhood causes serious long-term liver disease which is an important and ongoing problem in the UK which can now be prevented with antiviral therapy.

Early treatment, especially before development of cirrhosis, significantly decreases morbidity and mortality associated with HCV infection.

We recommend that healthcare workers are aware of the prevalence of HCV in childhood, particularly in young adolescents, and that testing according to NICE guidelines is implemented and treatment is made available.

Pharmacological treatment of chronic HCV in childhood should be provided to children by health authorities based on the present evidence of increased risk of serious liver disease in adulthood.
