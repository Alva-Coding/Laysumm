TITLE

A central hydrophobic E1 region controls the pH range of hepatitis C virus membrane fusion and susceptibility to fusion inhibitors

PARAGRAPH

This study describes diverse compounds that act as HCV membrane fusion inhibitors.

It defines viral properties that determine sensitivity to these molecules and thus provides information to identify patients that may benefit from treatment with membrane fusion inhibitors.
