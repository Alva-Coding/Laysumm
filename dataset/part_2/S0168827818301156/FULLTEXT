TITLE

Prolactin improves hepatic steatosis via CD36 pathway

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common public health problem affecting up to 25% of adults around the world1 and is associated with a series of metabolic co-morbidities.

NAFLD is initially caused by an imbalance between lipid demand and supply; however, the pathogenesis of the disease also involves crosstalk between liver and extrahepatic organs, including adipose tissue and the central nervous system (CNS).2

By sensing and integrating peripheral signals (such as leptin), hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) neurons in the CNS can induce hepatic fatty acid oxidation.3

By contrast, pituitary-released hormones, such as growth hormone, have been shown to suppress lipid uptake in liver.4,5

PARAGRAPH

Prolactin (PRL), a polypeptide produced predominantly by the anterior pituitary gland, has potent stimulation effects in lactation and reproduction on binding to its cell surface receptors (PRLRs) in the mammary gland.6

Nonetheless, PRLR is also expressed in metabolic tissues, such as liver, pancreas, and adipose tissue.7

Previous studies have documented favourable roles of PRL/PRLR in metabolic homeostasis.

Serum PRL levels in both genders were markedly decreased in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).8

In addition, they were inversely correlated with triglycerides (TG) in females with polycystic ovary syndrome9 and positively associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in obese children.10

PRL can inhibit the mRNA and protein expression of fatty acid synthase in adipocytes, revealing its anti-lipogenic function.11

PRL can also upregulate the expression of PRLR in human adipose explants, through which PRL exerts its anti-lipolytic action.12

Moreover, Prlr−/− mice displayed greater fat mass when fed a high-fat diet (HFD).13

However, the role of PRL/PRLR in hepatic lipid metabolism is yet to be elucidated.

PARAGRAPH

Thus, in the current study, we investigated whether PRL/PRLR is involved in the development of NAFLD.

We also explored the relationship between PRL and the severity of hepatic steatosis by liver histology.

In addition, the potential mechanisms of PRL/PRLR signalling in regulating hepatic lipid were determined in HepG2 cells.

The Ethics Committee of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital approved the study protocol, and all individuals provided written informed consent.

The study protocol conforms to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.

This study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT03296605).

SECTION

Clinical cohort study

PARAGRAPH

From September 2015 to January 2017, a cohort of 859 eligible adult patients (441 men and 418 women) aged between 18 and 80 years were enrolled from the Endocrinology Department of Drum Tower Hospital affiliated to Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, China.

The exclusion criteria for the study were: hepatic enzymes levels more than fivefold the upper normal level;14 history of alcohol consumption (≥140 g/week for males or 70 g/week for females); other liver diseases, including chronic hepatitis B or C infection, biliary obstructive diseases and autoimmune hepatitis; history of steatogenic medication; hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism; systematic corticosteroids; pregnancy; type 1 diabetes mellitus; malignant tumours; and pituitary disease.

PARAGRAPH

All the enrolled patients underwent abdominal ultrasound under fasting conditions.

The ultrasonography was conducted using Philips HD15 Ultrasound Unit (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) by the same sonographer, blinded to the patients’ information.

According to the abdominal ultrasound, clinical NAFLD was diagnosed based on the characteristic echo patterns, including: (1) brightness of the liver; (2) diffuse increased echogenicity of the liver parenchyma relative to the kidney; (3) echo attenuation into the deep hepatic portion; (4) blurring of intrahepatic vessels; and (5) poor visualisation of diaphragm.

NAFLD was diagnosed with at least the presence of the first and second criteria.15

SECTION

Bariatric surgery and human liver specimens

PARAGRAPH

A total of 85 eligible obese patients (30 men and 55 women) who underwent metabolic surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) in our hospital from March 2017 to June 2017 were analysed.

Liver tissues samples (approximately 1.5 × 2.0 × 2.0 cm3) from each patient were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed in 5% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.

Then, 5 μm sections were stained, and liver histology was assessed according to the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network scoring system, described previously,16 by two liver pathologists, blinded to the patients’ clinical data.

Hepatic steatosis was defined according to the proportion of affected hepatocytes: S1 (5–33%, ‘mild’), S2 (33–66%, ‘moderate’), and S3 (>66%, ‘severe’).

NAFLD activity score (NAS), including steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and lobular inflammation, as well as fibrosis stage, was also evaluated.16

PARAGRAPH

For immunohistochemical assays, liver sections were deparaffinised and rehydrated, followed by 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) blocking.

The sections were then probed with primary antibody to PRLR (ab170935, Abcam, Cambridge, USA) at 4.0 °C in a humidified chamber overnight followed by 2 h incubation with a secondary antibody at 37.0 °C.

The images were captured using a Panoramic 250 slide scanner (3DHistech Ltd., Hungary), and the brown staining of PRLR was considered as positive.

PARAGRAPH

Total RNA, extracted from human liver tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), was reverse transcribed into cDNA using a Takara RT reagent Kit (Bio, Otsu, Japan).

Real-time PCR was performed on a Light Cycler 480 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).

β-actin was used as the housekeeping gene for normalisation of gene expressions.

The primers used are listed in Table S1.

SECTION

Clinical measurements

PARAGRAPH

Anthropometric characteristics and fasting venous blood samples were collected for all patients.

Individuals without previously diagnosed T2DM were subjected to a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after an overnight fast of at least 8 h. Impaired glucose regulation (IGR): 5.6 mmol/L ≤ fasting blood glucose (FBG) <7.0 mmol/L and 2 h blood glucose (BG) <7.8 mmol/L; or FBG <5.6 mmol/L and 7.8 mmol/L ≤2 h BG <11.1 mmol/L.

T2DM was defined as patients having at least one of the following: history or current use of antidiabetic medication, or FBG ≥7.0 mmol/L or 2 h BG ≥11.1 mmol/L, or HbA1c ≥6.5%.17

Plasma glucose concentration was measured using a hexokinase method (TBA-200FR, Tokyo, Japan).

The level of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was measured by HPLC (HLC-73G8, Tosoh, Japan).

PRL was estimated in an automated chemiluminescent immunoassay (Siemens Immulite 2000, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostic Products Ltd, UK).

Fasting insulin (FINS) was determined by an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (Roche).

Serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and TG were detected using an autoanalyser (Abbott Laboratories, Parsippany, USA).

Insulin resistance was measured by the homeostasis model assessment of the HOMA-IR index using Eq. (1):18HOMA-IR=FINS(μIU/mL)×FBG(mmol/L)/22.5

PARAGRAPH

Medication information was collected from patients with diabetes.

In female patients who underwent metabolic surgery, serum free fatty acids (FFAs), IL-6, adiponectin, and leptin levels were also tested (see Supplementary Methods).

SECTION

Cell lines

PARAGRAPH

HepG2 cells were bought from the Cell Bank of the Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology (Chinese Academy of Sciences) and characterised by the Genetic Testing Biotechnology Corporation (Suzhou, China) via short tandem repeat (STR) markers.

Mycoplasm was detected using the Hoechst DNA stain method.

PARAGRAPH

HepG2 cells were incubated with a mixture of FFA (oleic acid and palmitic acid at the proportion of 1:1,500 μmol/L, Sigma, St Louis, USA) or an increasing concentration of PRL (10–200 μg/L) for 24 h, as indicated.

Moreover, adenoviral vector-mediated overexpression of PRLR was transfected in HepG2 cells 24 h before treatment with FFA or PRL.

For the downregulation of PRLR or promotion of CD36 expression, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against PRLR or the plasmid with CD36 (Genechem, Shanghai, China) overexpression was transfected into HepG2 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).

The shRNA sequence of PRLR was 5′-TAGTGACTTCACCATGAAT-3′, and the scrambled sequence was 5′-TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′.

In addition, 500 μmol/L FFA or 100 μg/L PRL was added post transfection, as indicated.

The expression of PRLR, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), phosphorylated STAT5 (pSTAT5), and CD36 were detected by western blot and quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR.

Briefly, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche).

The lysate was collected by centrifugation, and the total protein extract was denatured.

LY294002 and primary antibodies to β-actin, STAT5, pSTAT5, AKT, and pAKT (Ser473) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (CST; Danvers, MA, USA).

Anti-PRLR and anti-CD36 were obtained from Abcam.

The band intensities were quantified by Image J software (National Institutes of Health, USA).

Results

SECTION

Serum PRL concentration is negatively associated with NAFLD

PARAGRAPH

The clinical and biochemical variables of the patients are summarised in Table 1.

Compared with those with non-NAFLD (198 men and 205 women), patients of either gender with NAFLD (243 men and 213 women) presented with higher body mass indices (BMI), waist, and waist:hip ratios (WHR), and higher levels of FBG, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, ALT, AST, TG, and TC, and lower levels of HDL (all p <0.05).

Serum PRL levels were significantly decreased in patients with NAFLD (men: 7.9 [range, 5.9–10.3] µg/L vs. 9.1 [range, 6.8–13.0] µg/L, p = 0.002; women: 8.7 [range, 6.1–12.4] µg/L vs. 11.6 [range, 8.2–16.1] µg/L, p <0.001) compared with those with non-NAFLD.

Given the inverse relationship observed between serum glucose and PRL levels,8 the concentrations of PRL in the subgroup of individuals with normal glucose tolerance were compared.

Patients of either gender with NAFLD exhibited lower PRL levels compared with those without NAFLD (Table S2).

PARAGRAPH

The individuals were divided into four groups based on the quartiles of PRL concentrations.

The quartile ranges of Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 of serum PRL levels were ≤6.3, 6.3–8.4, 8.4–11.5, and >11.5 µg/L in men and ≤6.7, 6.7–10.0, 10.0–14.2, and >14.2 µg/L in women, respectively (Tables S3 and S4).

A gradual decrease was noted in the prevalence of NAFLD in both genders along with the increased quartile of PRL (Q1, 64.9%; Q2, 59.5%; Q3, 53.2%; Q4, 42.7%; p = 0.007 in men; Q1, 66.7%; Q2, 59.4%; Q3, 49%; Q4, 28.2%.

p <0.001 in women).

PARAGRAPH

Multivariate analyses were conducted of age, sex, BMI, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, the presence of diabetes and IGR, as well as PRL for NAFLD among all individuals.

The results showed that increasing BMI was a risk factor for NAFLD, and age and PRL were negatively and significantly associated with NAFLD (Table S5).

We then further analysed the odds ratios (ORs) (95% CIs) for NAFLD across the PRL quartiles.

OR in the highest quartile of PRL level compared with the lowest quartile was 0.48 (0.23, 0.99) in men and 0.36 (0.13, 0.97) in women (Fig. 1).

SECTION

Circulating PRL level and hepatic PRLR expression are decreased in patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD

PARAGRAPH

Serum PRL levels were explored in liver biopsies from all 85 patients (55 women and 30 men) who underwent metabolic surgery.

First, we compared circulating PRL levels in 44 obese women with NAFLD and age-matched 11 obese women with non-NAFLD (Table 2); patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD exhibited statistically lower levels of PRL (9.6 [range, 6.7–14.1] µg/L) compared with patients with non-NAFLD (15.8 [range, 12.1–18.2] µg/L, p = 0.003) (Fig. 2A).

PRL levels in patients with different severities of steatosis (44 women and 30 men) were evaluated based on the histological diagnosis (Table 3).

PRL levels in patients with severe hepatic steatosis (affected hepatocytes >66%) were lower compared with those with mild-to-moderate hepatic steatosis (affected hepatocytes 5–66%) in both women (8.5 [range, 4.2–10.6] µg/L vs. 9.8 [range, 8.2–15.7] µg/L, p = 0.027) and men (8.3 [range, 5.4–9.5] µg/L vs. 9.7 [range, 7.1–12.3] µg/L, p = 0.031) (Fig. 2B and C).

PARAGRAPH

Hepatic PRLR gene and protein expression in patients who underwent liver biopsies were evaluated via qRT-PCR and immunostaining, respectively.

Patients with NAFLD exhibited a reduction in hepatic PRLR mRNA levels (Fig. 2D) and protein expression (Fig. 2E) compared with individuals with non-NAFLD.

SECTION

Hepatic PRLR gene expression is negatively correlated with CD36 in patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD

PARAGRAPH

The role of PRL/PRLR in hepatic lipid metabolism was then investigated.

Hepatosteatosis results from increased de novo lipogenesis and FFA uptake or decreased FFA β-oxidation, and very LDL (VLDL) export.

CD36 is a major mediator of hepatic FFA uptake and a critical target downstream of class I cytokine receptors, including PRLR.19

PARAGRAPH

In human liver tissue, patients with NALFD (44 females) exhibited a significant decrease in PRLR gene levels (Fig. 2D) and an increase in hepatic CD36 (Fig. 3A) gene expression compared with patients with non-NAFLD (11 females).

Moreover, the mRNA level of PRLR was significantly and negatively correlated with CD36 in patients with NAFLD (Fig. 3B, 44 females and 30 males), whereas no correlations were established between PRLR and genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and de novo lipogenesis, including acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) (Fig. 3C), sterol response element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) (Fig. 3D), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARa) (Fig. 3E), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1a) (Fig. 3F).

SECTION

PRL alleviates lipid accumulation via the hepatic PRLR/CD36 pathway

PARAGRAPH

The mechanisms of PRL/PRLR action on lipid metabolism in vitro were also explored.

In HepG2 cells, PRLR protein levels increased with PRL treatment from 10–100 μg/L in a dose-dependent manner, although the level was not further enhanced from 100 to 200 μg/L (Fig. 4A).

Interestingly, both adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PRLR (Fig. S1) and PRL treatment reduced lipid accumulation, as revealed by ORO staining (Fig. 4B) and TG quantification assays (Fig. 4C), whereas PRLR silencing (Fig. S2) via shRNA significantly ameliorated PRL-reduced lipid levels in cells (Fig. 4C).

PARAGRAPH

In FFA-induced HepG2 cells, PRL treatment significantly decreased the protein expression of CD36, and stimulated STAT5 phosphorylation, a critical upstream regulator of CD36 (Fig. 5A).

Similarly, PRLR overexpression significantly reduced the mRNA (Fig. 5B) and protein expression of CD36 (Fig. 5C), and enhanced the phosphorylation of STAT5 (Fig. 5C).

By contrast, the gene expression levels of ACC, SREBP1c, PPARa, and CPT1a were not affected significantly (Fig. 5D).

In addition, the effects of PRL on CD36 and phosphorylation of STAT5 were markedly reduced after PRLR silencing (Fig. 5E).

Moreover, CD36 overexpression (Fig. S3) partially reversed the PRL-induced reduction in hepatic lipid levels, as revealed by TG measurements (Fig. 5F).

These data indicated that CD36 is essential for the PRL/PRLR-mediated amelioration of hepatic steatosis.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Besides its well-known lactogenic action, PRL was recently also identified as a metabolic hormone.20

In the current study, it is shown that low PRL levels are a risk factor for the development and progression of NAFLD.

PRL ameliorates lipid accumulation through PRLR-mediated inhibition of CD36.

The current data not only provide the first evidence of the lipid-lowering role of PRL in hepatocytes, but also emphasise the crucial regulation of liver homeostasis by the central neuroendocrine system.

PARAGRAPH

Cumulative evidence has identified PRL as a protective regulator against dysregulations of glucose and lipid metabolism.

A high level of PRL was associated with the reduced risk of hyperglycemia and cardiovascular diseases in men,21,22 whereas a low-dose PRL injection potentiated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in diabetic rats.23

Moreover, chronically elevated serum PRL levels induced by ectopic pituitary graft led to decreased circulating FFA concentrations in mice.24

Here, we used two clinical cohorts to show that PRL was significantly and negatively correlated with NAFLD.

In the second cohort study, patients were well phenotyped for hepatic lesions because each subject underwent liver biopsy, the gold standard for diagnosing NAFLD.

Moreover, our data showed that PRL levels were further decreased as the disease progressed from mild and moderate to severe steatosis.

PARAGRAPH

PRL is secreted not only by the pituitary gland, but also by adipose tissue.25

The amount of PRL released by a pituitary lactotroph is from four- to five orders of magnitude higher than that released by adipocytes and adipocyte-derived PRL is retained locally, acting as an autocrine/paracrine factor.26

Therefore, the influence of PRL on hepatic metabolism in the current study was largely attributed to pituitary rather than adipose tissue.

Previous studies proposed that PRL regulates adipokine secretion, such as adiponectin and leptin.13,27

To test whether these affect PRL levels and NAFLD, the serum concentrations of FFAs, IL-6, adiponectin, and leptin in female patients who underwent liver biopsy were examined.

No significant differences were found in these factors between the non-NAFLD and NAFLD groups (Table 2); therefore, the negative association between PRL and NAFLD might not be influenced by these factors.

PARAGRAPH

An earlier report revealed the inhibitory effect of PRL on lipid synthesis in maternal rat liver.28

Mice with liver-specific knockdown of PRLR manifested impaired glucose tolerance, whereas the overexpression of hepatic PRLR reversed the hepatic insulin resistance,29 thereby highlighting a vital role of PRL and PRLR in hepatic metabolism.

In our study, human hepatic PRLR was concomitantly downregulated in patients with NAFLD when circulating PRL levels were reduced, and PRL (<100 μg/L) intervention enhanced PRLR expression in HepG2 cells.

Given that 100 μg/L is higher than the physiological concentration range of PRL, we also investigated whether PRL 20 μg/L (near-normal range in humans) exerts a beneficial effect on hepatic lipid metabolism.

The results showed that PRL 20 μg/L also exhibited similar effects to 100 μg/L in reducing CD36 protein expression and TG content in HepG2 cells (Fig. S4).

However, a higher concentration of PRL (>100 μg/L) treatment in vitro did not further upregulate the expression of PRLR, implying that further upregulation of PRLR is not likely to occur in patients with prolactinoma.

Thus, PRLR might not have a beneficial effect on lipid metabolism and physiologically elevated PRL differs from pathological hyperprolactinaemia with respect to metabolism.

This phenomenon might partially explain why patients with hyperprolactinaemia also exhibit metabolic disturbances.30

Although moderately increased PRL levels promotes insulin sensitivity, high-dose PRL administration aggravates hepatic insulin resistance in diabetic murine models.23,31

PARAGRAPH

CD36, also known as FAT, is an FFA transporter that facilitates FFA uptake and has a profound impact on the development of NAFLD.

Increased hepatic CD36 expression causes lipid deposition, whereas the suppression of CD36 is resistant to hepatic lipid accumulation.32

Herein, we showed that human hepatic PRLR expression was significantly decreased in obese patients with NAFLD and negatively correlated with CD36 levels; however, genes involved in hepatic de novo lipogenesis and FFA β-oxidation were not identified.

In FFA-treated HepG2 cells, both PRL administration and PRLR overexpression reduced the expression of CD36 and TG content, and knocking down PRLR attenuated these effects.

Moreover, CD36 overexpression partially reversed the PRL-induced reduction in hepatic lipid levels.

Thus, these results indicated that the lipid-reducing effect of PRL is mediated by PRLR and CD36.

PRLR exerts its biological function via cellular kinases, including PI3K/AKT, STAT5, and Ras/MAPK.33

Among these three signalling pathways, the activation of STAT5 can improve hepatic steatosis by inhibiting CD36 in HFD mice.34–36

Furthermore, we observed that phosphorylated STAT5 was increased after PRL intervention or PRLR overexpression in HepG2 cells.

Besides STAT5, the PI3K/AKT pathway also participates in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism.37

We found that the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 did not affect the levels of CD36 protein after PRL intervention (Fig. S5), indicating that the effect of PRL on hepatic lipid metabolism is independent of the PI3K/AKT pathway.

Taken together, these results suggest that PRL/PRLR protect the liver against lipid accumulation by inhibiting STAT5/CD36 in hepatocytes.

PARAGRAPH

Nevertheless, the present study has several limitations.

First, the clinical cohort study was carried out in a group of participants with a high prevalence (>80%) of T2DM; however, the negative association between PRL and NAFLD persisted after adjusting for HbA1c levels, HOMA-IR, and the presence of diabetes.

By contrast, the subgroup analysis in individuals with normal glucose tolerance showed similar results, suggesting that decreased PRL leads to fatty liver that is independent of T2DM.

Additionally, in the first clinical cohort study, the use of metformin was statistically different in diabetic males between the non-NAFLD and NAFLD group, whereas it was comparable in diabetic females between these groups (Table S6).

In particular, there was no significant difference between the non-NAFLD and NAFLD groups in terms of antidiabetic treatments in female patients who underwent liver biopsy (Table S7).

Moreover, metformin and insulin are reported to have little effect on liver histology other than the amelioration of liver enzymes;38,39 hence, the effect of glucose-lowering medication on the association between PRL and NAFLD might not be clinically significant in this study.

However, further studies determining their relationship in the general population without a history of using antidiabetic medication, and with a large sample size, are required.

Second, the secretion of PRL is pulsatile, and a single measurement of serum might not be adequate to represent PRL levels throughout the day; nonetheless, pulsatile secretion occurs primarily during the night and is relatively constant during the day.40

All individuals underwent the PRL examination at 08:00 h and, thus, variation in PRL secretion at different times during the day was avoided.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that PRL/PRLR improved hepatic steatosis via suppression of CD36.

The current in vivo human study and in vitro study provides insights into the modulation of NAFLD physiopathology; in addition, activation of hepatic PRL/PRLR signalling could serve as a novel potential target for the treatment of NAFLD.
