TITLE

Risk factors for intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an exceptionally aggressive cancer arising from the biliary duct epithelium.

CCAs represent approximately 3 to 5% of all malignancies of the gastrointestinal system.

CCAs are classically sub-divided into 3 groups depending on the anatomical site of origin: intrahepatic CCA (iCCA), perihilar CCA (pCCA) and distal CCA (dCCA).

iCCAs classically arise above the second-order bile ducts, whereas the anatomical point of distinction between perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (pCCAs) and distal cholangiocarcinomas (dCCAs) is the cystic duct.1–5

pCCA account for approximately 50–60% of all CCAs, dCCA 20–30%; and iCCA approximately 10–20%.

iCCAs comprise about 10% of all primary liver cancers, making them the second most common primary hepatic malignancy after hepatocellular carcinoma.4,6

CCA typically presents late with non-specific symptoms.

This is compounded by the lack of knowledge of risk factors in most cases and inaccurate screening tools, making the diagnosis of early, resectable disease uncommon.

Beyond this stage, CCA is one of the most fatal cancers with a 5-year survival of approximately 5%.6

PARAGRAPH

The incidence of CCA varies globally and particularly so between East and West.

Northeast Thailand reports the highest age standardised incidence rates of CCA of 113/100,000 in men and 50/100,000 in women, which are approximately 100-fold greater than European and North American rates of around 1–2/100,000.6

However, several studies report a rising incidence of iCCA in recent decades across diverse geographical regions, in contrast to a stable or declining incidence of eCCA.5,7–12

The reasons for these trends are unclear, but the ongoing overall increase in the incidence of CCA makes it imperative to understand the disease’s aetiology and risk factors.

PARAGRAPH

Presumably, geographical variations in CCA incidence are likely to be due to differences in environmental and genetic risk factors.

The most significant known risk factor for the development of CCA in East Asia involves parasitic infection, specifically with Opisthorchis viverrini (OV) or Clonorchis sinensis.13,14

OV is endemic in Northeast Thailand with a prevalence of 9.4%.15

In the West, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is the most common known risk factor, for example a case-control study by Choi and colleagues showing an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 117.16

In addition, case-control studies and meta-analyses have proposed other risk factors for CCA, including: hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV); biliary tract diseases (e.g. choledochal cyst, cholelithiasis); cirrhosis and environmental toxins.17–20

However, the few accepted risk factors account for only a minority of CCA cases, particularly in the Western world.

Most cases are sporadic, occurring without any accepted or known risk factors.

There are data on other potential and more common risk factors, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, alcohol/alcohol-related liver disease, smoking and hypertension, but several of these have not been subjected to meta-analyses.

Previous meta-analyses have also tended not to distinguish between eCCA and iCCA, which are increasingly recognised as clinically and pathobiologically distinct entities.5

The 2 most comprehensive meta-analyses of CCA risk factors to date were performed by Palmer and Patel in 201217 and Kamsa-ard et al. in 2018.21

The first study quantitatively defined the risk of 7 risk factors, including HBV and HCV, cirrhosis and alcohol, for iCCA only.

The second study examined 17 risk factors, but did not distinguish the subtype of CCA.

Furthermore, the study by Kamsa-ard only included case-control studies performed in Thailand, and hence several risk factors studied, such as parasitic infection and treatment with the antihelminthic, praziquantel, have local geographical relevance only.

The remaining meta-analyses have mainly analysed a single or a few risk factors, and their association with either iCCA or eCCA.18,22–40

In recent years, newer case-control studies have shown some significant results, several of which have not been meta-analysed.

Consequently, there is a need for an updated meta-analysis that includes all recent case-control studies and also examines previously inconclusive risk factors, including their quantifiable effect on both iCCA and eCCA.

The aim of this study was to perform the most comprehensive global meta-analysis of risk factors to date, for both iCCA and eCCA, other than the established risk factors of PSC and liver flukes.

Furthermore, we aimed to compare the relative importance of shared risk factors between Eastern and Western regions for the first time.

Materials and methods

SECTION

Literature search

PARAGRAPH

To identify relevant studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis, a search of the National Library of Medicine’s MEDLINE database using Ovid was conducted.

The following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) were included: “cholangiocarcinoma”, “bile duct neoplasms”, “biliary tract neoplasms” and “risk factors”.

The following terms were also searched as keywords: “bile duct carcinoma”, “biliary tract carcinoma”, “biliary tree cancer” and “biliary tree carcinoma”.

The search was not restricted by country or language.

Only studies performed after 1990 were included, due to the update in the International Classification Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O), which altered the classification of the CCA subtypes.

Furthermore, we performed a manual search of the reference lists of the selected studies.

SECTION

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

PARAGRAPH

Studies were included if they fulfilled the following criteria: (i) case-control study design, (ii) provided sufficient data to calculate ORs, (iii) specifically defined individual risk factors and (iv) reported outcomes for association between risk factor and iCCA or eCCA or both.

Studies were excluded if any of these criteria were unmet and/or for failure to distinguish between tumour subtypes.

Studies were selected in an unblinded manner.

SECTION

Data extraction

PARAGRAPH

The following information was extracted from each study: name of first author, year of publication, country, definition of risk factor and number of individuals and controls with and without the risk factor of interest.

The raw data extracted from each study are available in Table 1.

SECTION

Quality assessment

PARAGRAPH

Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale (NOS).41

This scale consists of the following 3 dimensions: selection, comparability and exposure, covered by 8 items.

Four points can be scored for selection, 2 for comparability and 3 for exposure.

Studies were scored out of 9, with a higher score indicating higher quality.

Studies with a score of 1–3 were considered low quality, those with a score of 4–6 were considered intermediate quality and those with a score >7 were considered high quality.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 (Cochrane Community, 2014), which generated a Forest plot, pooled ORs and CIs for each risk factor.

Study heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane Q test and I2 test and publication bias was examined using funnel plots.

Random-effects meta-analysis (Der Simonian and Laird) was used to pool results from studies looking at risk factors.

Meta-regression was used to compare differences between regions for selected risk factors.

This was performed using Stata 15 (StataCorp 2017, Dallas, Texas, USA).

Results

SECTION

Study selection and study characteristics

PARAGRAPH

The literature search of MEDLINE identified a total of 1,487 references, of which 1,445 were excluded for failing to meet the inclusion criteria or lack of relevance, generating 42 references for further screening (Fig. 1).

Seventeen were excluded for the following reasons: failure to define tumour subtype, failing to employ a case-control design or the full paper not being available in English.

This resulted in 25 studies eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis (Table 1).

A total of 13 risk factors were eligible for meta-analysis: alcohol, choledochal cysts, cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis, cholecystocholithiasis, cirrhosis, HBV, HCV, hypertension, IBD, obesity, smoking and T2DM.

PARAGRAPH

Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model due to heterogeneity between the included studies.

Meta-regression was used to compare differences between regions for these 4 risk factors: cirrhosis, HBV, HCV and alcohol, and only for iCCA.

PARAGRAPH

A summary of the pooled ORs for all risk factors is given in Table 2.

Forest plots for individual risk factors for iCCA and eCCA are available in Appendix 1 (Figs. S1–13).

SECTION

Publication bias and study quality

PARAGRAPH

Funnel plots indicated no evidence of potential publication bias (available in Appendix 2).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

This is the most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to date, which studied the association between risk factors and both iCCA and eCCA within both the Eastern and Western hemispheres.

This meta-analysis was the first to show that choledochal cysts, which are congenital cystic dilatations of the biliary tree,64 were most strongly associated with both iCCA and eCCA (OR 26.71 and 34.94, respectively).

Cirrhosis was found to confer a significant CCA risk, with a stronger association with iCCA than eCCA (OR 15.32 and 3.82, respectively).

Choledocholithiasis was also observed to be a prominent risk factor, with a greater association with eCCA than iCCA (OR 18.58 and 10.08, respectively).

Neither hypertension nor obesity had a statistically significant association with iCCA (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.89–13.7 and OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.93–1.39, respectively) or eCCA, (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.77–1.90 and OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.84–1.70, respectively).

This is the first meta-analysis to examine the association between cirrhosis, choledocholithiasis, cholecystocholithiasis, cholelithiasis and hypertension with eCCA, as well as the association between hypertension and iCCA.

Meta-regression revealed that in Eastern countries, cirrhosis and HBV conferred a greater risk of iCCA than in Western countries.

However, there was no statistically significant geographical difference for HCV and alcohol.

These geographical differences are interesting to observe and may be explained by the difference of risk exposure from both genetic variations and environmental factors.

PARAGRAPH

Previously reported risk factors including choledocholithiasis, cirrhosis, HBV and HCV were found to be significant and the ORs were generally comparable to those reported in prior literature.

However, the varying definition of cholelithiasis in the literature leads to uncertainty as to the true risk of CCA, requiring further studies to quantify choledolithiasis, cholecystolithiasis, hepatolithiasis and cholelithiasis definitively.

The less established risk factors were all associated with significant risk for iCCA and eCCA, including alcohol (OR 3.15 and 1.75, respectively), IBD (OR 2.68 and 2.37, respectively), T2DM (OR 1.73 and 1.5, respectively) and smoking (OR 1.25 and 1.69, respectively).

PARAGRAPH

One of the key findings is the difference in the degree to which these risk factors are associated with iCCA and eCCA (Table 2).

Cirrhosis, HBV, HCV, IBD and T2DM were found to have a greater association with iCCA, in contrast to choledochal cysts, choledocholithiasis cholelithiasis, cholecystolithiasis and smoking, which conferred a greater risk of eCCA.

The findings are concordant with the primary locations that are targeted by the specific factors.

Viral hepatitis and cirrhosis primarily affect the intrahepatic bile ducts, whereas cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis and cholecystolithiasis affect the extrahepatic bile ducts.

The risk factors associated with both iCCA and eCCA are T2DM, alcohol and smoking, which are likely to be general risk factors for malignancy; while choledochal cyst develops in both the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts.65

PARAGRAPH

Choledochal cysts are very rare in the Western world with an incidence of 1/100,000–150,000, a stark contrast to Asia where the incidence is 1/1,000.66

Despite the greater burden of CCA in the East, multiple studies have identified increasing iCCA incidence and mortality in Western countries.

Bertuccio and colleagues reported an increase of incidence and mortality in 12 European countries, with the highest increases occurring in Germany, France and the UK.11

Interestingly, there is mounting evidence for an upward trend in the incidence of IBD, T2DM, cirrhosis, alcohol-related liver disease and cholelithiasis in the US and Europe,67–72 which appear to correspond to the rising incidence of iCCA.

The results of this meta-analysis show that the increasing incidence of these risk factors may be contributing to the increasing incidence of iCCA, but clearly further cohort studies are required to confirm a causal relationship.

However, there is still no clear explanation for the stable/declining incidence of eCCA through the same period.

Although the association between the aforementioned risk factors and eCCA are weaker than iCCA, the association remains significant and is likely contributed to by other undiscovered risk factors of eCCA.

PARAGRAPH

In future studies, other potential risk factors that have been suggested in case-control studies may be suitable for meta-analysis, such as chronic pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease and haemochromatosis.43,49,52

Furthermore, studies exploring potentially protective factors such as aspirin, would be of interest.16,73,74

PARAGRAPH

There is a paucity of data on the risk factors for pCCA.

This is particularly important as pCCA comprises 50–60% of CCA cases, and its epidemiology and aetiopathogenesis are debated as a result of ICD coding not distinguishing between pCCA and eCCA until now.4,5

Additionally, the fact that all CCA cases cannot be explained by the currently identifiable and established risk factors may mean a significant genetic component to CCA pathogenesis, which will require identification via whole genome sequencing.75

Further evidence for this comes from case-control studies showing that family history may confer a disease risk.54

Finally, it will be interesting to execute a comprehensive meta-regression comparing the relative strength of various risk factors for iCCA and eCCA in different parts of the world, once there are sufficient case-control data to power such analyses.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis has found choledochal cysts to be the most significant risk factor for both sporadic iCCA and eCCA, followed by choledocholithiasis and cirrhosis.

Previously inconclusive risk factors have been confirmed and could feasibly be contributory to the increasing trend in iCCA, but further investigation is required to verify this relationship and explore other aspects of the aetiopathogenesis of CCA.
