TITLE

Risk factors for intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis

PARAGRAPH

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a cancer arising in the bile ducts inside (intrahepatic CCA) and connected to the liver (extrahepatic CCA).

It is a very aggressive cancer: 95% of patients die within 5â€¯years.

CCA rates are increasing globally, but the causes of CCA are poorly understood.

The few risk factors that are known account for only a minority of cases.

In this study, we found that the strongest risk factors for both intrahepatic and extrahepatic CCA are cysts and stones in the bile ducts, cirrhosis, and hepatitis B and C viruses.

Some risk factors for CCA, such as diabetes, although less strong, are increasing globally and may be contributing to rising rates of CCA.
