TITLE

Defining virus-specific CD8+ TCR repertoires for therapeutic regeneration of T cells against chronic hepatitis E

PARAGRAPH

Patients who are immunosuppressed are vulnerable to developing chronic liver disease following infection with hepatitis E virus (HEV).

To-date, there is no approved therapy for chronic hepatitis E. Interferon-Î± and ribavirin are off-label treatment options, but their applications are limited by side effects.

Thus, immunotherapy, more specifically T cell-based therapy, may be an alternative approach.

We designed T cell receptor-engineered T cells that effectively conferred immune cells, taken from patients with chronic hepatitis E, with the ability to recognize virus-specific epitopes and mediate killing of target cells in vitro.
