TITLE

Defining virus-specific CD8+ TCR repertoires for therapeutic regeneration of T cells against chronic hepatitis E

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis in the global population.

HEV is an emerging public health risk found in both the developed and developing countries.1,2

There are several genotypes of HEV but only one serotype.

Genotypes 1 and 2 only infect humans, and are distributed mainly in endemic regions where poor hygiene is the main cause of transmission via the fecal-oral route.

Genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic; their hosts include both humans and animals, and are found predominantly in urbanized countries.

Genotype 3 virus is transmitted by consumption of raw or improperly cooked meat or viscera of infected animals,2 or through transfusion of contaminated blood products.3

Usually, patients with acute hepatitis E spontaneously clear the virus.

However, immunosuppressed patients, such as solid organ transplant patients, may develop chronic hepatitis E in around 50% of cases.4,5

Reversion or reduction of the immunosuppressive status may induce spontaneous viral clearance.4–6

If this is not effective or possible, treatment choices are limited.

There is no approved therapy for chronic hepatitis E, but interferon-α or ribavirin are off-label treatment options.

Unfortunately, interferon-α is contraindicated in patients receiving lung, heart or kidney transplants as it can trigger graft rejection.6

Therefore, for these patients, ribavirin is their only option.

However, side effects of ribavirin such as hemolytic anemia limit its use.

Ribavirin is effective in approximately 80% of patients who are able to tolerate its use.7

For those who fail treatment, chronic hepatitis E can progress to liver cirrhosis.6,8

Additionally, a recent study has shown that ribavirin induces mutations in HEV, 9 leading to enhanced viral replication and eventually drug failure.10

PARAGRAPH

Thus, there is an unmet need for alternative treatment options.

Previous findings demonstrated that CD8+ T cells play an important role in mediating immunity against HEV infection.11

We hereby propose the pioneering idea of using T cell therapy as the alternative treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis E.

PARAGRAPH

Similar to findings in chronic hepatitis B or C, HEV-specific T cells are in paucity and usually associated with exhausted phenotypes due to constant exposure to viral antigens.12

Concepts to either restore or induce HEV-specific T cell responses may be a feasible approach to clear chronic HEV infection.

With the recent development of immunotherapy using redirected T cells specific for hepatitis B virus (HBV) to target HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma,13 herein, we investigate the possibility of generating HEV-cytotoxic T cells by transfer of engineered T cell receptors (TCRs).

Patients and methods

SECTION

Study cohorts

PARAGRAPH

Twelve patients with acute autochthones HEV infection (aHEV), 9 patients with chronic HEV infection (cHEV) and 9 healthy donors were recruited between 2014–2019 at Hannover Medical School.

The diagnosis of acute infection was based on the detection of HEV RNA by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR; in-house diagnostic laboratory) using primers as described,14 anti-HEV IgM/IgG seroprevalence, and classical symptoms of acute hepatitis.

HEV serology was tested using ELISA-based method (Wantai Biological Pharmacy, China).

All patients with cHEV were solid organ transplanted, with more than 3 months of viremia.

Four out of 9 chronic patients were included in the T cell receptor redirection assay.

HEV seronegative donors are defined by either HEV-naïve (not exposed to HEV) or spontaneously recovered from an asymptomatic HEV infection (resolved and lost anti-HEV IgG).

Characteristics of patients are summarized in Table S1; all individuals were human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2+, as confirmed by antibody staining using mouse anti-human-HLA-A2 (AlexaFluor647; Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA).

Individuals enrolled in this study gave their written informed consent for participating in immunological research projects.

This study was reviewed and approved by the local ethics committee of Hannover Medical School (approval number 2315–2014).

SECTION

HEV overlapping peptide pools

PARAGRAPH

HEV genotype 3c overlapping peptides were synthesized by ProImmune (Oxford, UK), GenBank accession number AF455784.

Peptides were made up of 15 amino acids, overlapped by 5 amino acids and spanned the entire 3 HEV open reading frames (ORFs).

Overlapping peptide pools (OLPs) 1 to 8 covered ORF1, OLPs 9 to 11 covered ORF2; ORF3 was combined with ORF2 within OLP 11.

Peptides were dissolved in sterile DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) before being grouped into respective peptide pools consisting of 21 to 26 peptides each.

The amino acid sequences of all 248 peptides are listed in Table S2.

SECTION

HEV-specific Dextramers bearing HLA-A*02:01-restricted T cell epitopes

PARAGRAPH

HEV-specific 15-mer epitopes were first identified through positive peptide pools using cytokine readout in intracellular cytokine staining.

Next, all the overlapping peptides within that pool were recombined into different matrix sub-pools for a second re-stimulation of the T cell line, to pinpoint a 15-mer target epitope.

The amino acid sequences of the positive 15-mer targets were then retrieved from Table S2.

These 15-mer epitopes were further narrowed down to 9-mer using IEDB analysis resource Consensus tool,15 before being sent for major histocompatibility complex class I HLA-A*02:01 Dextramer® synthesis and then labeled with PE fluorochrome (Immudex, Copenhagen, Denmark).

Dextramer staining of ≥0.2% was considered positive.

SECTION

T cell culture and feeder T2 cell line

PARAGRAPH

Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from blood was carried out as per standard density gradient separation protocol using Biocoll Separating solution (Biochrom GmbH, Germany).

PBMCs were frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until use.

Isolation of CD8+ T cells from PBMCs was done using magnetic MACS CD8+ T cell isolation beads following the protocol (Miltenyi Biotec, USA).

Media for CD8+ T cell culture and TAP-deficient T2 cell line (ATCC CRL-1992) maintenance were described previously.16

T2 cells were loaded with HEV OLPs at a final concentration of 1 µg/ml and irradiated with Caesium-137 (Cs-137) at 40 Gy prior to co-culture at 1/5 of the T cell number.

The medium was changed every 3–4 days, while irradiated peptide-loaded T2 cells were replenished every week.

The entire culture lasted for 3 weeks.

SECTION

CD8+ T cell functional assay using intracellular cytokine staining

PARAGRAPH

At the end of 3-week culture, 0.2 × 106 CD8+ T cells were seeded for intracellular cytokine staining (ICS).

The cells were re-stimulated with the same pool of HEV peptides (5 μg/ml) added to the medium, in the presence of Brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at 2 µg/ml for 6 h incubation.

Dextramer staining was performed at room temperature for 20 min.

Thereafter, the cells were stained with surface antibodies, fixed and permeabilized, and finally stained with intracellular cytokine antibodies as described separately.16

The cells were acquired using BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Bioscience); results were analyzed using FlowJo (FlowJo, LLC) and SPICE (NIAID, USA).

The gating strategy is outlined in Fig. S1 and antibody information is detailed in the supplementary CTAT Table.

SECTION

HEV-specific CD8+ T cell sorting and TCR repertoire sequencing

PARAGRAPH

HEV-specific CD8+ T cells were sorted using Dextramer by BD Aria IIu (in-house sorting facility).

The cell pellets were resuspended in RNAprotect® Cell Reagent (Qiagen GmbH, Germany) and shipped frozen to Adaptive Biotechnologies (Seattle, USA) for TCR repertoire sequencing of alpha and beta chains (ImmunoSEQ).

Based on the sequencing results, the nucleotide sequences of alpha and beta chains of each TCR were reconstituted for the entire V(D)J segment for TCR gene constructs.

SECTION

TCR plasmid DNA gene construction and transient TCR redirection

PARAGRAPH

TCR gene constructs were designed and murinized by replacing the human constant chain with murine analogues.17–19

Synthetic genes were manufactured by Invitrogen and cloned into E. coli for amplification.

TCR plasmid DNA were purified for linearization (Endofree Plasmid Maxiprep, Qiagen) and the subsequent mRNA synthesis using mMESSAGE mMACHINE® T7 Ultra Kit (Life Technologies) with ARCA capping and poly-A tailing.18

PBMCs from HLA-A2+ donor or patients with cHEV were expanded for 7 days in AIM-V medium supplemented with 2% human AB serum, 600 IU/ml of IL-2 and 50 ng/ml of anti-CD3 (BioLegend, USA).

The day before redirection, IL-2 was increased to 1,000 IU/ml.

In preparation for TCR redirection, 20 µg of mRNA encoding the individual TCR construct was added to 10 × 106 cells, and transferred to a cuvette for electroporation using Amaxa Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V and Nucleofector 2b device, program X-01 (both from Lonza, Switzerland).

Post-redirection, T cells were kept in AIM-V medium supplemented with 2% human AB serum and 100 IU/ml of IL-2.

One day later, engineered T cells were used in co-culture assays, using peptide-loaded T2 cells as target cells.

The co-culture lasted for 6 h and was followed by ICS.

Results

SECTION

Identification of HLA-A2-restricted HEV-specific CD8+ T cell responses in patients with acute hepatitis E and healthy donors

PARAGRAPH

CD8+ T cells from HLA-A2+ donors and patients were cultured in the presence of HEV overlapping peptides (loaded on T2 cells) for 3 weeks to allow sufficient expansion of HEV-specific T cells.

At the end of expansion, HEV-specific T cell epitopes were identified based on functional response by the detection of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α and MIP-1β) using intracellular cytokine staining.

As shown in Fig. 1A,B cytokine responses were more pronounced in patients with acute hepatitis E than control donors.

If a specific peptide pool stimulated cytokine production in CD8+ T cells, the target peptide of 15 amino acids (15-mer) was identified from the pool.

Fig. 1C shows a simplified workflow outlining this epitope identification process.

T cell responses in patients were both stronger (higher percentage of cytokine-producing CD8+ T cells) and broader (present in more peptide pools) than the donor cohort.

SECTION

Characterization of ORF1-specific T cell epitope

PARAGRAPH

Based on cytokine readout, the identified 15-mer epitopes are listed in Table 1.

Three of the epitopes were further narrowed down to 9-mer using IEDB consensus tool, and confirmed by Dextramer staining (Table 1).

We found that there is no epitope in ORF3 capable of stimulating T cell immunity in the present cohorts.

In addition, the number of responders found in ORF2 is notable, although ORF2 is comparatively smaller in genomic size than ORF1.

This observation corresponded to the findings of Brown et al., where the HEV capsid encoded by ORF2 was a highly targeted region,20 probably due to its crucial role in host cell attachment and eliciting neutralizing antibody.21

Fig. S2 shows Dextramer staining of epitope YVSDTVTFV (ORF2, peptide pool 10) in a representative patient with acute HEV infection, which we did not pursue further as the T cell responses against this epitope were low.

PARAGRAPH

Nonetheless, our results indicated that the most robust T cells responses with the highest level of cytokine production were against ORF1, the non-structural part of the HEV genome, with sufficient cell proliferation for subsequent analysis.

Two prominent epitopes, one located at the helicase (pool 6, HEV-1116) and the other in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; pool 8, HEV-1527) were chosen for further comparison.

Both epitopes were found to be conserved in HEV genotype 3, based on viral genomic data available in the NCBI database.

Furthermore, re-analyzing deep sequencing results generated from a separate study with a cohort of 12 patients with cHEV revealed that HEV-1527 was conserved throughout ribavirin treatment9 (Fig. S3), which reaffirmed that ribavirin-induced mutagenesis is absent in this HEV-1527 epitope.

PARAGRAPH

CD8+ T cells specific for the HEV-1116 epitope were detected by ex vivo Dextramer staining in 2 patients with acute hepatitis E.

These cells displayed an effector memory phenotype (Fig. 2A).

After in vitro expansion with the HEV-1116 peptide, we observed HEV-1116-specific T cells in 3 patients with acute hepatitis E.

A high proportion of the Dextramer-binding T cells were also cytokine-producing (Fig. 2B).

On the contrary, there were fewer HEV-1116-specific T cells in chronic patients compared to acute patients, both ex vivo and post-expansion.

Only 1 cHEV patient displayed >0.2% Dextramer-positive cells ex vivo (Fig. 2A) and in vitro expansion with the HEV-1116 peptide did not result in strong responses.

Even after PD-L1 blockage, T cell functions were only restored in some but not all of the patients with cHEV (Fig. 2C,D).

Similar characteristics of HEV-1527-specific T cell proliferation and function were observed in chronic patients (Fig. S4).

SECTION

TCR α-chain variable gene (TCRAV) 12-02 was selected in HEV-specific T cells

PARAGRAPH

CD8+ T cells specific for the 2 selected epitopes were sorted using Dextramers from 3 acute patients and 1 donor.

Next generation sequencing of TCR repertoires revealed that TCRAV12-02 was the only common V gene found in all sorted samples, ranging from 12–80% of gene usage frequency, albeit targeting 2 different epitopes (Fig. 3A,B).

This finding suggests that TCRAV12-02 has an important role in HEV control.

The CDR3 sequences are summarized in Table 2; results from patient aHEV6 were excluded from the TCR redirection assay as there was an unresolved β chain, most likely due to its less distinct Dextramer-positive population (Fig. 3A).

Seven pairs of TCR to be included in TCR redirection were: 1116.

A1 consisting of TCRAV29-01 and TCRBV07-08*01 from patient aHEV5; 1116.

B1 consisting of TCRAV12-02 (J31-01) and TCRBV07-09, 1116.

B2 consisting of TCRAV12-02 (J21-01) and TCRBV07-09, 1116.

B3 consisting of TCRAV12-02 (J31-01) and TCRBV05-01*01, 1116.

B4 consisting of TCRAV12-02 (J21-01) and TCRBV05-01*01 from patient aHEV10; 1527.

A1 consisting of TCRAV04-01*01 and TCRBV04-02*01, 1527.

A2 consisting of TCRAV12-02 and TCRBV04-02*01 from Donor D2 (Fig. S5).

SECTION

TCR redirection assay using HEV-specific TCRs showed polyfunctional characteristics and cytotoxicity

PARAGRAPH

TCR redirection using synthetic mRNA could bypass T cell clonal expansion to generate effector T cells expressing antiviral TCRs of interest,22 which suited our approach to characterize the immune potential of the candidate TCRs.

Post-redirection, Dextramer staining of the engineered T cells was performed to identify which construct could constitute a functional TCR.

PARAGRAPH

Four TCR constructs were able to recognize respective Dextramers: 1116.

A1, 1116.

B3 and 1116.

B4 for HEV-1116 Dextramer, and 1527.

A2 for HEV-1527 Dextramer (Fig. 4A,B).

Among the TCRs constructed from patient aHEV10 (1116.

B1 to B4), the presence of TRBV07-09 instead of TRBV05-01*01 diminished the functionality of TCR.

Intriguingly, having TRAJ31-01 could restore some function in 1116.

B1 compared to 1116.

B2.

This is an interesting observation as J gene, a short linker sequence in the α chain that consists of a few amino acids, could make or break the fate of the TCR.

PARAGRAPH

To ascertain the functionality of TCR-engineered T cells, they were co-cultured with T2 cells loaded with respective target peptides for 6 h, with and without Brefeldin A for intracellular cytokine assays and killing assays, respectively.

As expected, TCR-redirected CD8+ T cells that were Dextramer-binding also produced IFN-γ upon encountering their respective target peptides (Fig. 4C).

The multiplicity of immune potential, as shown in SPICE analysis on 2 TCR pairs as representatives (1116.

B3 and 1527.

A2), demonstrated that TCR-engineered T cells were polyfunctional producers of proinflammatory cytokines: IFN-γ, TNF-α, MIP-1β as well as CD107a when stimulated (Fig. 4D).

Patient data taken from aHEV10 is shown in Fig. S6, to compare the HEV-1116-engineered T cells against the original clone from this patient.

There was a close resemblance in both Dextramer-binding capacity and cytokine production, affirming that the redirection method did not change the functional nature of the TCR.

PARAGRAPH

Using HEV-1527-redirected T cells as an example, cytotoxicity was noted by a reduction of the peptide-loaded T2 cells, a relative increase of CD8+ T cells within the T2 gate and concurrently an increase in the dead cell population, which was used to calculate net T2 cell death (Fig. S7).

Fig. 4E summarizes the net killing effect of the TCR constructs, averaging at about 70–80% after 6 h of co-culturing, with the highest killing observed in constructs 1116.

SECTION

Target sensitivity, specificity and response rate of engineered T cells

PARAGRAPH

We next examined the characteristics of TCRs in parameters that are of clinical relevance, such as target sensitivity, specificity and time-dependent dynamics in recognizing and responding to target cells.

PARAGRAPH

TCRs with high target affinity are an important determinant in adoptive T cell therapy.23

To test affinity, T2 cells loaded with various peptide concentrations ranging from 0 to 1 µg/ml were used to stimulate the redirected T cells.

It was found that the minimum peptide concentration to elicit cytokine responses was 1 pg/ml (Fig. 5A).

Particularly in construct 1116.

B3, a gradual reduction of Dextramer-binding intensity was observed when redirected T cells were stimulated with increasing peptide concentrations (Fig. 5B).

PARAGRAPH

Henceforth, we selected TCRs 1116.

B3 and 1527.

A2 for further characterization, with 1116.

B3 representing 1116.

A1 and 1116.

B4.

A validation of TCR specificity was done in a cross-stimulation experiment, whereupon the TCR targeting HEV-1116 was stimulated by HEV-1527 peptide, and vice versa.

As expected, there was no cytokine observed when the mismatch peptide was used as stimulant (Fig. 5C).

PARAGRAPH

Due to the transient nature of this method, the redirected cells will eventually lose the TCR, and consequently, the TCR’s functions over time.

Fig. 5D shows the Dextramer staining over a period of 5 days post-redirection; 1116.

B3 was able to retain Dextramer for a longer duration than 1527.

A2.

Since Dextramer-binding CD8+ T cells were decreasing exponentially, we expected the cytokine production to follow the same pattern.

However, as depicted in Fig. 5E, 1527.A2-specific T cell function remained prominent from day 2 onwards even though Dextramer staining was almost non-existent.

As for target cell death, a difference was observed – while the killing effect of 1527.

A2 followed the cytokine’s diminishing pattern over time, it was a disparate scenario with 1116.

B3, as the killing was sustained across 5 days (Fig. 5f).

This may be an intrinsic feature of 1116.

B3 TCR, whereupon the killing is achieved as long as a minimum cytokine threshold is fulfilled.

PARAGRAPH

Lastly, we investigated the TCRs for their response rate to elicit targeted killing – how fast the TCR could recognize target, produce cytokines and ultimately mediate killing of target cells.

Fig. 5G shows that T2 cell death was noticeable (higher than the baseline cell death observed in untransfected controls) starting as soon as 1 h after co-culturing in 1116.

B3, and 2 h in 1527.

A2.

SECTION

TCR-redirected T cells isolated from patients with cHEV were polyfunctional and cytotoxic against target cells

PARAGRAPH

We also explored if similar results could be obtained using peripheral CD8+ T cells isolated from 4 patients with cHEV, who were found to be non- or low-responders to PD-L1 blockade (Fig. 2C).

Patient-derived T cells were redirected using the same established workflow, with 2 TCR constructs, 1116.

B3 and 1527.

A2.

The redirected T cells were examined for their Dextramer-binding capacity, as well as their functionality and cytotoxicity when stimulated by peptide-sensitized T2 cells.

This was done as a proof-of-principle to apply TCR redirection in T cells isolated from patients with persistent infection, to examine its effectiveness.

Fig. 6 shows that patient-derived TCR-redirected T cells bind their respective Dextramers, as well as being highly polyfunctional and capable of mediating killing of T2 cells in an HEV-specific manner, to a similar extent as redirected T cells from immunocompetent donors (Fig. 4E).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

There is an unmet need for new treatment alternatives in chronic hepatitis E, as interferon-α is contraindicated in most organ transplant patients.

Although ribavirin has been officially endorsed in a recent guideline,5 side effects restrict its use, along with a risk of increased viral mutagenesis which might enhance replication, leading to therapeutic failure,9,10 To date, no further treatment regimen is available if patients fail ribavirin or are ineligible.

Sofosbuvir, a direct-acting antiviral drug developed to block hepatitis C virus replication by inhibiting the HCV polymerase, was found to be effective against HEV in vitro,24 but effectiveness of sofosbuvir in vivo remains elusive as case reports showed conflicting results.25

Immunotherapy could be a novel approach to treat chronic infectious disease such as cHEV because broad and multi-specific T cell responses are known to control acute hepatitis E virus infection and exhausted T cell phenotypes are observed in patients with cHEV.11

Unlike the active research of immunotherapy in chronic hepatitis B,13,23 applying this in patients with cHEV has not been proposed, and our work sets in motion the initial groundwork for a new approach towards T cell-based therapy in cHEV.

PARAGRAPH

We i) screened and pursued HEV epitopes that are HLA-A2-restricted in the entire HEV genotype 3 genome, ii) sorted the HEV-specific CD8+ T cells to explore their repertoire diversity, iii) reconstituted the TCRs to characterize their immune affinity, and finally iv) demonstrated, as a proof-of-concept, that TCR-redirected T cells from cHEV patients (who showed no or low HEV-specific CD8+ T cell responses) were conferred with immunogenicity against epitope-loaded target cells.

PARAGRAPH

We used an unbiased method to screen for epitopes using HEV overlapping peptides, and identified 12 potential 15-mer epitopes.

However, our method was not intended to identify all possible HEV epitopes.

Out of 12 targets identified, there were 3 9-mer epitopes that could be confirmed by using Dextramer staining in multiple individuals.

Two of the HLA-A2-restricted HEV epitopes that we reported here, SLFWNEPAI and YVSDTVTFV, coincidently matched those reported by Brown et al.20

PARAGRAPH

In addition, we found a novel epitope at the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region, LLWNTVWNM (HEV-1527).

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report the repertoire of HEV-specific TCRs.

We have identified TCRs targeting 2 conserved HEV epitopes: 3 against HEV-1116 and 1 against HEV-1527 for further TCR redirection.

PARAGRAPH

Because of potential safety concerns, we used a transient mRNA-based TCR redirection method, rather than a retroviral vector transduction.22,23

The TCR constructs that we tested were able to emulate the original T cell’s immunity.

Redirected cells were capable of Dextramer binding, highly specific in target stimulation, proinflammatory cytokine production and cytotoxicity against target cells.

Although Dextramer-binding capacity was similar to the original T cell clone, there was a gap between Dextramer-binding and cytokine-producing cells in the TCR-redirected cells.

This gap was consistent in all experiments, and was also reported in HBV-specific TCR,22,26 which may be an intrinsic feature of the assay.

PARAGRAPH

Despite this, the effectiveness of TCR redirection was proven in patients with cHEV.

Patient-originated TCR-engineered T cells were conferred with polyfunctionality and cytotoxicity that was comparable to the redirected T cells isolated from immunocompetent donors.

We have previously reported on the lack of HEV-specific T cell responses among patients with cHEV;11,27 where checkpoint inhibitors could enhance T cell proliferation to some extent.

In this study, we included patients with cHEV who were insensitive to PD-L1 blockade in proliferation as well as in T cell function.

With the use of TCR redirection, the rarity of HEV-specific T cells is no longer an obstacle to confer viral-specific immunity, because all effector T cells could be redirected with HEV-specific TCR, thereby harnessing the intact signaling machinery in these T cells and turning them into cytotoxic HEV-specific T cells.

This also demonstrated that chronic HEV infection has no or limited effect on the overall T cell population.

The slightly lower (redirected) T cell function observed in patients with cHEV may be due to immunosuppression.

Hence, for chronic patients who are exhausted with current treatment options, immunotherapy with TCR redirection may be more fit-for-purpose.

PARAGRAPH

Moving forward, we hope to test our TCRs in vivo, e.g in a mouse model, in order to assess their translational potential.

Mouse models to study HEV infection have been developed recently,28–30 and would serve as an excellent avenue for us to examine the redirected TCRs in a chronic setting.

Although our work is still in its infancy and restricted to HLA-A2 individuals, it is a milestone for future development into viable immunotherapy for patients with chronic HEV infection.
