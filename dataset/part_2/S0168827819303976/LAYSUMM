TITLE

Elimination of hepatitis C virus has limited impact on the functional and mitochondrial impairment of HCV-specific CD8+ T cell responses

PARAGRAPH

Direct-acting antiviral therapy results in cure of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in almost all treated patients.

However, the impacts of HCV cure on immune responses remain controversial.

Whether immune responses to HCV recover is important in cases of re-exposure, or for the resolution of extrahepatic manifestations.

The main finding of our study was that HCV-specific T cells remain functionally impaired despite HCV clearance.

This finding could explain the fact that HCV cure does not lead to protective immunity and that re-infections have frequently been observed.
