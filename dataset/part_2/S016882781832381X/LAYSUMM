TITLE

Supportive and palliative care in people with cirrhosis: International systematic review of the perspective of patients, family members and health professionals

PARAGRAPH

Patients and their families had a poor understanding of advanced liver disease and its impact on them.

They need more information about the treatments they receive and how to get practical and psychological support.

Liver specialists and GPs found it difficult to talk to patients and their families about the seriousness of advanced liver disease and the lack of healthcare options available to them if their condition gets worse.

All doctors and nurses involved in the care of patients with advanced liver disease recognise that palliative and supportive care have an important role in improving patient care.
