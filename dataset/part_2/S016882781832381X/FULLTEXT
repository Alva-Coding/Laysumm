TITLE

Supportive and palliative care in people with cirrhosis: International systematic review of the perspective of patients, family members and health professionals

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Advanced liver cirrhosis is characterised by the development of clinical complications of portal hypertension or liver insufficiency.1

It is a growing international public health problem due to increases in alcohol consumption, rates of obesity and viral hepatitis.2–5

It often affects people of working age2,6 and is the third most common cause of premature death in the UK.7

PARAGRAPH

Most people dying from liver cirrhosis are not suitable for liver transplantation and of those in the UK who are suitable, 17% will die before a donor becomes available.10

Living with cirrhosis may involve considerable symptom burden, and when liver failure ensues the prognosis is poor, often requiring repeated hospital admissions and multiple clinical interventions to deal with complex physical symptoms.11

People experience both physical and psychosocial challenges12,13 and often have unmet needs in five key areas: informational/educational, practical, physical, patient care and support and psychological.13

Moreover, there are difficulties with regards to accessing general health care in low- and middle-incoming countries (defined using the World Bank definition),8 where high treatment costs are an additional stressor in people with cirrhosis.9

PARAGRAPH

A supportive and palliative care approach could benefit people living with cirrhosis.14

‘Supportive and palliative care’ are two broad encompassing terms which overlap with each other.

Supportive care may be defined as care which meets the physical, informational, social, spiritual and practical needs of a person with chronic disease at all stages of the patient’s illness from pre-diagnosis, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.13,15

The WHO definition of palliative care is, interdisciplinary care to improve the quality of life of patients facing life threatening illness by addressing their physical, emotional and spiritual needs and by supporting their families.16

For the purposes of this review and to ensure consistency, the terms ‘supportive and palliative care’ will be used to incorporate these two related concepts together.

PARAGRAPH

Initiating early supportive and palliative care can improve symptom control in people with cirrhosis.17,18

Supportive and palliative interventions should seek to improve communication and care coordination whilst encouraging discussions on unmet information needs and end of life preferences.19

To achieve this, it is important to know what people with cirrhosis understand about the nature and prognosis of their disease, and to understand what unmet needs they may have as a result.

As delivery of supportive and palliative care requires a multidisciplinary approach, it is key to explore how health professionals from different specialities feel they can work together to provide this care.

Notably, whilst liver professionals acknowledge they have a role to play in this aspect of care,20,21 it is important to understand how liver health professionals communicate with their patients and family members about the disease and its treatment.

PARAGRAPH

Herein, we aimed to systematically and critically review the literature on supportive and palliative care in cirrhosis by exploring the evidence about: (1) patients’ and family members’ understanding of their disease; their perceived needs including their informational ones; and their communication with health professionals; (2) health professionals’ perspectives on their communication with patients and family members about their disease and treatment; (3) health professionals’ perspectives about the delivery of care to people with cirrhosis and how health professionals from different specialities can work together to improve supportive care.

Search strategies

PARAGRAPH

A literature search was conducted in three databases: Medline (1950-June 2017), Embase (1991-June 2017) and CINAHL (1982-June 2017).

These searches were last conducted on 17th June 2017.

PARAGRAPH

To identify articles for questions 1 and 2, the following search terms were used:

PARAGRAPH

(communicat∗ or understanding or need∗ or concern∗) AND (cirrhosis or (advanced adj3 liver disease∗) AND (perspectives or views or survey or interview∗) AND (care or treatment∗ or disease or service∗)

PARAGRAPH

To identify articles for question 3, the following search terms were used:

PARAGRAPH

(health personnel or nurse or nursing staff or physician or doctor or health professional) AND (cirrhosis or (advanced liver disease) AND (perspectives or views or survey or interviews or concerns) AND (care or treatment∗ or disease or service∗)

PARAGRAPH

The inclusion criteria were research studies:

Reporting on the perspectives of patients or health professionals on liver cirrhosis or the provision of palliative care in cirrhosis.

Including adults (aged 18 years and above) with cirrhosis.

PARAGRAPH

Articles in languages other than English were considered if the English translation of the abstract met the above inclusion criteria.

SECTION

Study selection and data extraction

PARAGRAPH

GR and KP independently assessed the citations against the inclusion criteria.

For citations where there was a disagreement in eligibility, further assessment was conducted independently by JL and SD.

A final consensus of eligible articles was obtained as part of a group discussion between GR, KP and JL.

GR and KP read through the full text articles of all eligible articles and independently extracted the following data from the included studies where available: title, author(s), country of study, year of publication, study design, study setting; study population and participant demographics and baseline characteristics; themes/outcomes explored; key findings.

GR and KP compared data extraction to obtain consensus.

Any disagreements were resolved by JL.

Final consensus for data extraction was obtained as part of group discussions between GR, KP and JL.

As a final check, SD went through all citations and numbers to ensure accuracy.

SECTION

Critical appraisal, analysis and presentation

PARAGRAPH

Both qualitative and quantitative study quality was assessed independently by three members of the team (GR, KP, JL) using methodological quality criteria outlined in the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT).22

This tool was selected because it was designed to be used in projects such as this that involve different study designs.

The criteria used to assess methodical quality for each study is displayed in Table S1.

Using the tool after independent assessment, the three researchers mutually agreed a final quality scoring.

In cases where disagreements existed, an experienced systematic reviewer (BC) reviewed the study to give a final assessment on its quality.

PARAGRAPH

For qualitative studies, the key findings were summarised to reflect the different research questions.

Quantitative accounts were analysed narratively.

Key findings from each eligible study specifically answering any of the three research questions were extracted and imported into the relevant table.

Qualitative and quantitative findings were grouped together according to their main themes relevant to this review.

SECTION

Registration

PARAGRAPH

This review was registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42017064770) on 3rd May 2017.

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

The search strategy generated 1,448 unique citations of which 19 articles met the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1).

There were 11 qualitative and eight quantitative studies.

One study described itself as a mixed methods study, but used only a qualitative method in collecting the relevant patients and health professional data for this review.

Most studies originated either from the United States (US) (6/19) or the United Kingdom (UK) (5/19).

The remaining studies originated from the following countries: Denmark (2), Sweden (1), Switzerland (1) Germany (1), Australia (1), Iran (1) and Brazil (1).

PARAGRAPH

Patient perspectives were described in 13 articles, three explored family members’ perspectives and eight examined health professionals’ perspectives.

Three studies presented data derived from both patients and health professionals, and one study presented data from both patients and family members.

PARAGRAPH

Of the 11 qualitative articles, semi-structured interviews were used to collect the data in all studies except one where semi-structured interviews and focus groups were used.

Most studies (7/11) used a qualitative descriptive approach in the analysis of their data.

The remaining studies used the following analytical approaches: phenomenology/interpretative phenomenological approach (3) and grounded theory (1).

PARAGRAPH

Of the eight quantitative studies, most used cross-sectional survey methods (7/8) in collecting their data.

Using the MMAT classification, all were identified as quantitative descriptive prevalence studies without a comparison group.

SECTION

Quality assessment

PARAGRAPH

The MMAT quality assessment of the studies is shown (Table 1).

The quality of the qualitative studies varied.

In several studies, the selection of appropriate sources to address the research question were either not stated or were unclear.

Most studies described the samples well, had good thematic description and robust analysis plans, and appropriately considered how the findings related to the context.

In sampling their participants, five studies stated that they used purposive sampling, whilst two used convenience sampling.

Of the four which did not state their sampling method, closer inspection of their recruitment procedure suggested that they used a convenience sample.

Most studies did not include any appropriate consideration about how their findings related to researchers’ bias.

The discussion sections of some of the studies were rather limited.

In the quantitative studies a variance in quality was also identified.

Most studies had a good sample strategy, the samples were representative of the population under study, and appropriate measurements were used.

Five of the eight studies had a response rate below 60%.

SECTION

Study participants

PARAGRAPH

Qualitative studies had a total sample of 78 patients with a median sample size of 11 (range 6–15) and quantitative studies had a total sample of 1,335 with a median sample size of 238 (range 29–541) participants.

Patients were mainly male (65%), with mean ages ranging from 46 to 61 years.

The underlying aetiology of cirrhosis was most commonly alcohol-related liver disease or hepatitis C. Five of the studies used the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD)23 and/or Child Pugh scoring systems24 to classify the severity of cirrhosis.

The mean MELD score of participants was 13.65 (range 11–16.3) for the two studies using this scoring system, indicating that participants, provided they were not diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), had a 6% chance of dying within the next three months.

For the four studies using the Child Pugh system, most participants were classified as Child Pugh A or B, indicating that they either had well-compensated disease or had significant liver function compromise.

Few studies provided details about ethnicity or education.

Relatives or informal carers were included in three studies with a total of 31 participants and a median sample size of 11 (range 8–12).

PARAGRAPH

The total sample size of health professionals for the qualitative studies was 88 with a median sample size of 22 (range 6–25) and for quantitative studies, the total sample size was 645 participants, with a median sample of 77 (range 54–514).

Nine studies included health professionals across a range of clinical specialties: these were mainly physicians and nurses from general practice, hepatology or specialist palliative care.

Four studies provided details of level of clinical experience (3/4) and/or frequency with which clinicians treated patients with cirrhosis (2/4).

Perspectives of people with cirrhosis and their family members

SECTION

Understanding of disease and its associated treatments

PARAGRAPH

Five qualitative25–29 and two quantitative studies30,31 contributed to the theme of understanding of disease and its associated treatments (Table 2).

Some people with cirrhosis had accepted that their disease would lead to a shorter life expectancy,27 although evidence about what they understood about their illness was mixed.

One study showed that patients could correctly answer questions concerning knowledge about, and treatments of, their disease.

Most indicated that people lacked understanding of their disease or its prognosis; were unaware that their symptoms were related to their cirrhosis;25–27,31 how their liver disease would progress;25 or why certain patients needed to be screened for HCC.31

Many patients did not consider their disease to be palliative in nature.28

Although patients understood that they may need to undergo complex procedures such as paracentesis,28 they were still unclear about the implications of many aspects of their care.28,29

SECTION

Communication with health professionals

PARAGRAPH

Six qualitative25,27–29,32,33 and two quantitative studies34,35 contributed to the theme of patients’ perspectives on communication with health professionals (Table 2).

Although patients with cirrhosis were twice as likely to talk to their doctors about liver disease than those not diagnosed with cirrhosis,34 they were not satisfied with the quality of information provided by their health professionals.

Patients felt that the explanations were too medicalised, and that more time was needed during their medical consultation for more effective information exchange.25

Patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis wanted to communicate with their professionals about strategies to combat craving for alcohol as part of an attempt to maintain control of their lives.29

Family members reported that hepatologists found it easier to understand their situation and preferred to take their relatives to see these professionals, but reported difficulties in discussing issues related to overt hepatic encephalopathy (Table 3).33

PARAGRAPH

Patients and their family members often felt stigmatized in their communications and interactions with health professionals,33 due to a perception that liver disease is associated with substance misuse,27,28,32,35 particularly among those professionals who had limited experience of working with patients with cirrhosis (Tables 2 and 3).27,35

Younger patients and those with hepatitis C felt socially isolated,32 with increased anxiety and depression.35

SECTION

Patients’ perceived needs

PARAGRAPH

Four qualitative9,27,28,32 and three quantitative studies30,35,36 contributed to the theme of patients’ perceived needs (Table 2).

Patients wanted to have better information about their cirrhosis and different aspects of care such as the admission process, the option of home-based care9,27 and about how to manage their symptoms.36

They also wanted information on a range of psychological and practical needs, such as stopping alcohol and substance misuse, developing cancer, losing the ability to do daily tasks, and fears about dying, the unknown and what the future holds.36

Some patients raised issues about the practical difficulties of living with semi-permanent abdominal drains.28

Many patients felt that their pain was undertreated.35

PARAGRAPH

Having clearer information about their next appointments and a better understanding of their disease may enable patients to plan their life better,27 encourage them to continue with their treatment9 or reduce their level of anxiety.9

Relatives felt that better information would increase their ability to detect hepatic encephalopathy, which in turn would both reduce their own anxiety and give them greater control (Table 3).32

These findings suggest that improving health professional-patient communication with the aim of increasing patient understanding of their disease, its treatments and its consequences, may improve patient and family carer outcomes.

However, having improved knowledge about their disease or their medication may not improve a person’s adherence to their medication regimen.30

SECTION

Health professionals’ perspectives

SECTION

Communication with patients with cirrhosis and family members about their disease and their treatment

PARAGRAPH

Three qualitative11,25,37 and three quantitative studies20,36,38 contributed to the theme of health professionals’ perspectives of their communication with patients and families about liver disease and its treatments (Table 4).

Health professionals were aware that both patients and family members had little understanding about their liver disease or its severity11,20 which if addressed, would greatly benefit patients.36

General practitioners (GPs) believed that patients with cirrhosis wanted to discuss HCC screening, but many had difficulty in discussing this topic with them.38

There was recognition amongst health professionals, particularly GPs that hepatologists, as the ‘liver experts’, were responsible for conversations about prognosis, disease progression and treatments.25,37

However, liver clinicians lacked both confidence and skills to have these conversations, only addressing these issues near the ends of patients’ lives.11,25

The two main reasons identified were the unpredictable nature of liver disease, (which made it difficult to identify the point of deterioration and so allowed health care professionals to avoid discussing the topic)11 and the negative perceptions that patients and family members had about palliative care.11

SECTION

Delivery of care and treatment to people with cirrhosis

PARAGRAPH

Three qualitative11,37,39 and three quantitative studies20,36,40 contributed to the theme of health professionals’ perspectives on delivery of care and treatment to people with cirrhosis (Table 5).

They identified that health professionals irrespective of speciality recognised that they provided suboptimal care for people with cirrhosis.20

Although gastroenterologists recognised both the importance and relevance of following guidelines for everyday practice, including the provision of dietary counselling by professional dieticians,40 liver clinicians generally did not address quality of life issues or palliative care options with patients or their family members, unless specifically raised by these groups.11

At the same time, liver clinicians recognised that poor disease and symptom management, and a lack of adequate information were considered major issues for patients,36 together with fears about losing functional ability, thoughts about dying, and uncertainty about their future.36

PARAGRAPH

Studies identified the delineation in the roles performed by primary care and liver specialists in caring for people with cirrhosis.

Primary care providers, such as GPs, perceived that they lacked both the expertise and experience of caring for people with cirrhosis37 and felt it more appropriate for these patients to be managed by liver specialists.20,37

They saw liver clinicians as the experts in making major decisions about cirrhosis management,39 especially in managing end of life complications such as hepatic encephalopathy.37

GPs saw their role as care co-ordinators, providing their patients with advocacy, education and preventative advice, as well as setting expectations about the disease course and acting as gatekeepers to specialty liver services.39

They also found it difficult to care for this group of people, citing issues such as comorbid mental illness and/or substance misuse, perceived low motivation and poor adherence to treatment which acted as barriers to providing good quality care.37,39

SECTION

How health professionals from different specialities can work together to improve supportive and palliative care

PARAGRAPH

Two qualitative11,37 and one quantitative studies20 contributed to the theme of improving supportive and palliative care through increased collaboration (Table 5).

Most GPs, liver and palliative care health professionals believed palliative care had a role in caring for people with cirrhosis, but recognised that the provision of palliative care to this group needed to be improved.

All these professionals recognised that there was a lack of coordinated care for people with cirrhosis, which was attributed to the different care approaches taken by the different specialities.

For liver clinicians, factors such as the unpredictable trajectory of liver disease, management of patient treatment expectations, clinician/patient perceptions of the palliative care role, poor continuity of care and perceived lack of skill and confidence were identified as reasons for not referring to palliative care.11

Conversely, GPs felt that liver specialists were more focused on pursuing active treatment, which made it more difficult for them to discuss prognosis with their patients.37

PARAGRAPH

Each medical speciality differed in their opinions about how supportive and palliative care for people with cirrhosis could be improved.

Both liver and palliative care clinicians felt that the integration of palliative care with liver services and multidisciplinary team working would enhance patient care.11

Palliative care clinicians also felt that it was important to prioritise improved liaison between secondary and primary care.20

All these professionals wanted to increase community provision of supportive and palliative care and to have a collaborative approach earlier in the illness trajectory.20

In adopting this approach, many GPs felt that they could manage their patients in the community.20

PARAGRAPH

Liver and palliative care clinicians, and GPs each had their own specific training needs in caring for people with cirrhosis at the end of life.20

For palliative care and GPs, more understanding was needed about the unpredictable trajectory of cirrhosis and the impact of impaired liver function on medication metabolism.

Liver health professionals needed improved awareness of supportive care available to them and when to refer to palliative care whilst GPs need improved knowledge about how palliative care can provide support in the community.20,37

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

This review explored patients and family members understanding of cirrhosis and its treatment, as well as their perception of unmet needs.

It also explored the quality of communication between health professionals and patients/close family members, while reviewing health professionals’ perspectives about delivering care to people with cirrhosis.

The following key themes were identified by patients, family members and health professionals: limited understanding of liver disease, unmet information needs, poor communication and a limited understanding of the palliative care role.

PARAGRAPH

This review is the first to critically examine studies exploring the experiences of people with cirrhosis and their family members, and the health professionals who provide care for them.

In this review, nearly all the included studies were published after 2013, indicating that this is a relatively recent area of interest.

Using the MMAT scoring rating, most studies were of fair to good quality (scoring between 50–75%).

PARAGRAPH

Studies, whether qualitative or quantitative, were methodologically variable in quality.

There was poor reporting on the key demographics of the different populations recruited in the studies.

Few patient studies used any measure to classify the severity of cirrhosis, or to document the ethnicity or educational status of their patients.

Health professional studies were limited in recording the professionals’ experience in caring for liver patients.

Therefore, confidence in these findings should be limited because this variability cannot be accounted for.

PARAGRAPH

The review was successful in identifying studies from nine countries across four continents, and incorporating a mix of different health care systems, but a limitation to the review is that the findings are based mainly on studies from the USA, the UK or other high-income Western countries.

Although our findings are consistent across different health care systems found in Northern Europe and the USA, both of which have different systems of charging for health care, only one study was identified from middle and low-income countries in Central Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and Latin America, areas where cirrhosis is an endemic health problem.4

This limits the applicability of these findings to other settings as the perception, communication and access to health care may be very different between continents and countries.

PARAGRAPH

Our findings suggest several recommendations to improve practice in this area.

Specifically, services for people with cirrhosis need to incorporate: 1) better patient-professional communication, which could involve the use of communication aides such as question prompt lists (QPL); 2) the provision of written information by health professionals to meet the needs of both patients and their families; 3) awareness by health professionals of the broader needs of patients and their families beyond their medical treatment; 4) improving palliative care coordination between the different medical specialities in caring for people with cirrhosis and developing new models of palliative care provision.

The following sections highlight possible ways in which these areas can be improved.

PARAGRAPH

This review has identified communication difficulties between liver health professionals, patients and family members about liver disease and its prognosis, which were highlighted in many studies as a major area for improvement.

One practical implication is the provision of written information by liver clinicians to patients and their family members to address their information needs concerning liver disease, its treatments and its impact.

Providing liver clinicians with advanced communication skills training may tackle some of these issues, but simple alternative pragmatic methods requiring minimal training, such as the development of communication aides should also be considered.

One such aide is the QPL, an evidence-based list of “recommended questions” given both to patients and family members prior to their consultation with health professionals.41

Although no QPLs have been developed specifically for people with cirrhosis, studies in other advanced diseases have shown that QPLs are effective at improving patient participation during the consultation and in stimulating discussions about prognosis in advanced cancer, and in helping patients to discuss difficult issues without interfering with the flow of the medical consultation.

Finally, strategies need to be developed to reduce the perception of stigma felt by patients when talking to health professionals.

PARAGRAPH

This review identified two key areas where supportive and palliative care for patients with cirrhosis could be improved: 1) identifying appropriate patients for early supportive and palliative care; 2) reconfiguring service delivery and improving care coordination between the different specialities responsible for providing care to patients with cirrhosis.

More specific initiatives include the need to design clearer pathways for interdisciplinary care for people with cirrhosis who are not eligible for transplant and joint work by specialist hepatology and palliative care in drawing up guidelines and care frameworks for people with cirrhosis.

In identifying which patients would be suitable for early palliative care referral, screening tools such as the Bristol screening tool42 or the specialist palliative care indicator tools43 have now been developed for use in a clinical environment, and may help support health professionals to identify suitable patients.

Improving care coordination was identified as an important element in improving early delivery of palliative care.

Shared care models or joint multidisciplinary teams were suggested as ways to improve care coordination between liver, palliative care teams and GPs; for example combined hepatology/palliative care multidisciplinary teams could be set up, similar to those set up in heart failure.44

PARAGRAPH

QPLs may be useful in improving communication between liver clinicians and patients and their family members.

Future research should focus on developing and validating such a communication tool specifically for people with cirrhosis.

PARAGRAPH

This review indicates potential mechanisms for developing shared care models and joint working between hepatology and palliative care.

In addition, there are currently several examples in the UK of early palliative care interventions in people with cirrhosis in Basildon (Essex)45 and Edinburgh,18 which have illustrated potential improvement in patient outcomes, though findings are limited by a lack of baseline data.

Future studies need to be more robust with the use of control groups, collection of baseline data and the identification of appropriate outcomes.

Finally, further testing is required to see whether prognostic tools can reliably identify people with cirrhosis in the last year of their life.
