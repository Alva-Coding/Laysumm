TITLE

Change in hepatic fat content measured by MRI does not predict treatment-induced histological improvement of steatohepatitis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the discovery of new pharmacological agents for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

This recent interest responds to an alarming rise in its prevalence and, more importantly, to the associated risk of progression to end-stage liver disease.1

Several randomized, controlled trials have recently been completed,2–8 and many more are still ongoing.9

PARAGRAPH

A percutaneous liver biopsy remains the gold-standard for the diagnosis of NASH and is required by the FDA for a new drug indication.10,11

However, early proof-of-concept studies often use changes in intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content by either magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) or proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) as a surrogate marker of resolution of NASH and/or improvement in fibrosis.12–14

PARAGRAPH

IHTG content measured by either 1H-MRS or MRI-PDFF correlates well with steatosis assessed by histology.15–17

Studies by Noureddin et al.16 and Middleton et al.17 demonstrated that longitudinal changes in IHTG content measured by magnetic resonance techniques strongly correlated with changes in steatosis on histology.

However, while it is generally assumed that changes in steatosis are likely to be followed by similar changes in other histological parameters, as well as resolution of NASH, there is a paucity of information regarding this relationship.

Moreover, the degree of IHTG content reduction required to improve lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, fibrosis, or to achieve resolution of NASH, remains unclear.

In a small (n = 35) short-term (24 weeks) study, Patel et al. showed that histologic responders had a significantly higher reduction of liver fat compared to non-responders.18

However, the authors defined histological response as a reduction in 2 points of the NAFLD activity score (NAS) score, which includes steatosis grade as a parameter.

Therefore, it is possible that a reduction in the steatosis grade could have significantly confounded the association.

More recently, the same group reported that changes in IHTG content during the phase II study of selonsertib did not predict changes in hepatocyte ballooning or fibrosis.19

PARAGRAPH

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the degree of IHTG content reduction and improvement in other histological parameters and resolution of NASH in a large cohort of patients followed for 6 to 18 months.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Patients

PARAGRAPH

A total of 121 individuals were recruited from Gainesville, FL and San Antonio, TX that participated in 1 of our 3 randomized controlled trials assessing pioglitazone in patients with NASH.4,20,21

Patients not included in this report were either randomized to vitamin E (14%), did not complete all follow-up visits or procedures (16%), refused the final liver biopsy (1%), or did not have paired 1H-MRS measurements available (24%).

PARAGRAPH

Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are available in prior reports.4,20,21

Briefly, patients with a diagnosis of biopsy-proven NASH, with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were included in the randomized controlled trials.

The main exclusion criteria were any other causes of liver disease, such as viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson’s disease, hemochromatosis, drug-induced hepatitis, a history of significant alcohol use (≥30 grams/day in males and ≥20 grams/day in females), as detailed elsewhere.4,20,21

Informed written consent was obtained from each patient prior to participation, and the study was approved by the IRBs from both universities (University of Florida, Gainesville, FL and University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX).

SECTION

Study design

PARAGRAPH

This is a longitudinal study of patients with complete 1H-MRS and histological data from 3 previously published randomized controlled trials.4,20,21

As part of those studies, at baseline and after treatment, patients underwent the following assessments: (a) liver 1H-MRS to quantify hepatic triglyceride content, (b) oral glucose tolerance test to measure insulin resistance and establish the diagnosis of T2DM according to the American Diabetes Association criteria,22 (c) dual energy x-ray absorptiometry to measure total body fat, and (d) a percutaneous liver biopsy to establish (or rule out) the diagnosis of NASH.

Patients were originally randomized to either placebo or active treatment: pioglitazone monotherapy in 2 studies,4,20 or combined with vitamin E in another.21

In this report, 62 patients participated in an 18-month trial comparing pioglitazone vs. placebo,4 22 patients participated in an 18-month trial assessing the use of vitamin E alone and combination therapy with pioglitazone and vitamin E,21 and 37 patients participated in a 6-month trial comparing pioglitazone vs. placebo.20

Study design was similar for all studies, except for 1 study which had a shorter duration of therapy.20

In this study we report only on those patients that received either placebo or pioglitazone during their participation in the study (patients randomized to vitamin E alone were excluded).

SECTION

Liver fat content by 1H-MRS

PARAGRAPH

Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the liver was acquired using methodology previously validated.15

Briefly, three 30 mm × 30 mm × 30 mm liver locations were selected avoiding vessels and bile ducts.

Liver fat content was calculated as fat fraction (area under the curve [AUC] fat peak/[AUC fat peak + water peak]) using commercial software (NUTS, Acorn NMR).

Measurements were corrected for T1 and T2 relaxation as previously described.23

While the 6-month trial20 used a 1.9 T scanner (Elscint Prestige), the 18-month trials used 3 T machines.4,21

SECTION

Liver biopsy

PARAGRAPH

An ultrasound-guided liver biopsy was performed in all patients at baseline and at the end of the study.

Biopsies were centrally read by 2 pathologists who were unaware of the individuals’ identity, time point (i.e., before or after therapy) or any clinical information.

Histologic characteristics for the diagnosis of NASH were determined using standard criteria.24,25

Histological response after therapy was defined as resolution of NASH (ballooning of 0 and inflammation of 0–1) without worsening of fibrosis.

Data was also analyzed considering a reduction in 2 points in the NAS from 2 different parameters without worsening of fibrosis as a secondary histological outcome.

The mean length of liver biopsies was 16.5 ± 0.7 mm, 13% were <10 mm, 30% were between 10–14.9 mm, 30% were between 15–19.9 mm, and 27% were ≥20 mm.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Values for continuous variables are reported as mean ± SD of the mean and as number (percentage) for categorical variables.

Comparison among groups was performed using ANOVA (Bonferroni’s pos hoc analysis for pairwise comparisons) or Kruskal-Wallis for continuous variables according to their distribution, or Pearson’s Chi-square or Fisher’s Exact Test for categorical variables.

A p value of <0.05 (2-tailed) was considered statistically significant.

All statistical calculations were performed using Stata 11.1 (StataCorp LP, TX, USA) and JMP version 11 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

Results

SECTION

Patient characteristics

PARAGRAPH

Demographic and clinical information of patients is described in Table 1, where they were divided based on the relative change of IHTG content after therapy (no change or increase; reduction of 1–30%; reduction of 31–50%; reduction of 51–70%; and reduction of >70%).

There were no statistically significant differences in baseline clinical variables among groups with different IHTG content reduction, except in plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels.

In Table S1, we have also summarized baseline clinical information of patients, but dividing them based on histological response (responders vs. non-responders) depending on the trial they had participated in.

The only significant differences observed in responders vs. non-responders were worse baseline histology (i.e., inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis) and higher prevalence of T2DM among responders of the longer clinical trial, as previously reported.26

Similarly, fasting plasma glucose levels were higher among responders of the 6-month clinical trial.

Of note, the degree of steatosis at baseline, based on either 1H-MRS or histology, were similar between histological responders and non-responders.

While age was statistically different among groups in the 18-month clinical trials, this difference had only minor clinical significance.

SECTION

Relationship between changes in IHTG content and histological changes

PARAGRAPH

In Fig. 1, we analyzed the rate of resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis based on the relative reduction of IHTG measured by 1H-MRS.

As can be observed, no significant changes in histological response were observed with increasing response in steatosis reduction by 1H-MRS in either patients randomized to placebo (Fig. 1A) or those taking pioglitazone (Fig. 1B).

In addition, we have also presented the data using a reduction of 2 points in the NAS (from at least 2 different parameters) and no worsening of fibrosis, as another histological outcome (Fig. 1C and 1D).

Again, no clear association was observed between IHTG content reduction and histological response.

No significant differences were observed in resolution of NASH when patients with a reduction of more than 30% of IHTG content were compared to those with less reduction (among patients randomized to pioglitazone: 49 vs. 33%, p = 0.67; among placebo users: 12 vs. 6%, p = 0.64).

Similarly, reduction of 2 points in the NAS (from at least 2 different parameters) and no worsening of fibrosis was also similar between patients achieving vs. not achieving a 30% reduction in IHTG (pioglitazone: 58 vs. 50%, p = 0.99; placebo: 20 vs. 15%, p = 0.73).

To assess whether IHTG above normal (i.e. >5.56%) may have a permissive effect on inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, we also assessed the rate of histological response among patients achieving vs. not achieving steatosis resolution (i.e. achieving an IHTG content below 5.56%).

As detailed in Fig. 2, no significant differences were observed in resolution of NASH or reduction of NAS score (without worsening of fibrosis) based on the presence of steatosis resolution.

To further analyze the role of IHTG content reduction in the prediction of resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis, we calculated the performance of each specific cut-off point of IHTG reduction (Table 2).

No specific cut-off point of IHTG content reduction was able to accurately predict the presence of resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis.

For example, a reduction of at least 30% in IHTG content, an outcome usually used in clinical trials, was only associated with a specificity of 41% and PPV of 38%.

In Table S2 we repeated this analysis including only patients that received active treatment with pioglitazone.

Again, no specific cut-off point of IHTG content reduction was able to predict resolution of NASH.

PARAGRAPH

In Fig. 3, rate of improvement in each of the histological parameters (lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, and fibrosis) was plotted for groups with different amounts of relative reduction of IHTG content.

As can be observed, no significant associations were detected between reduction of IHTG and these histological parameters.

Finally, we also assessed whether steatosis resolution (reaching an IHTG below 5.56%) could be associated with better histological response.

Patients with steatosis resolution had similar rates of resolution of NASH, irrespective of treatment arm (51% vs. 41% for active treatment with pioglitazone and 13% vs. 7% for the placebo arm, both p = 0.60).

PARAGRAPH

In Fig. 4, we have summarized inflammation (panels A-B), hepatocyte ballooning (panels C-D) and fibrosis (panels E-F) changes based on the presence or absence of steatosis resolution.

Only lobular inflammation in patients taking pioglitazone appeared to have a modest difference among patients reaching steatosis resolution vs. not doing so (p = 0.048).

All other histological changes in patients randomized to either placebo or pioglitazone were similar between patients reaching and not reaching steatosis resolution.

SECTION

Relationship between changes in IHTG content and surrogate markers of liver disease

PARAGRAPH

Relative changes observed in IHTG content after follow-up correlated with changes in plasma ALT (r = 0.23, p = 0.008), but not with changes in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (r = 0.13, p = 0.14), or CK-18 (r = 0.07, p = 0.50).

Of note, plasma ALT was more tightly related to changes in ballooning (r = 0.41, p <0.001) than changes in IHTG content measured by 1H-MRS.

Among patients with steatosis resolution, improvements of plasma ALT and AST were of similar magnitude to those observed in patients not reaching steatosis resolution as defined above (Fig. 5).

PARAGRAPH

Among patients randomized to placebo, changes in IHTG content after follow-up were significantly associated with weight loss (r = 0.33, p = 0.01).

Moreover, weight loss was also significantly associated with changes in hepatocyte ballooning (r = 0.42, p = 0.008), and fibrosis (r = 0.36, p = 0.02).

However, changes in IHTG content were not associated with changes in other metabolic parameters, such as hemoglobin A1c (r = −0.04, p = 0.83), fasting plasma insulin (r = −0.26, p = 0.14), or plasma triglycerides (r = 0.23, p = 0.17) concentration.

Reduction of IHTG content was associated with a significant increase in plasma HDL-C levels (r = −0.33, p = 0.04).

In the cohort of patients receiving pioglitazone, we observed no significant associations between changes in IHTG content and changes in hemoglobin A1c (r = −0.15, p = 0.34), fasting plasma insulin (r = −0.02, p = 0.89), plasma triglycerides (r = −0.09, p = 0.55), or plasma HDL-C (r = 0.04, p = 0.81) concentration.

SECTION

Sensitivity analysis

PARAGRAPH

Due to differences in the 6-month trial compared to the 18-month trial, we have performed a sensitivity analysis repeating the above calculations, but excluding the subgroup of patients that participated in the 6-month study.

As can be observed in Fig. 6A-B, no differences were observed in the overall results.

Due to the relatively small sample size (n = 37), the same kind of analysis could not be performed for the 6-month trial alone.

In addition, as prior studies have analyzed patients on active medication and on placebo combined,18,19 we have also presented this analysis combining the 121 patients (Fig. 6C-D).

As evidenced in this figure, when combining patients on placebo with those on active medication, it appears that a reduction in IHTG content is associated with resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

1H-MRS and MRI-PDFF have been consolidated as non-invasive gold-standards for the measurement of IHTG content in patients with NAFLD.15,16

Due to their high reliability and reproducibility, MRI-based techniques have also been consolidated as primary outcome measures in early proof-of-concept NASH clinical trials (i.e., phase I or II), working as surrogate markers of histological response (i.e., for hepatocyte necrosis and inflammation).12,13,18

However, in the current study, we suggest that changes in IHTG measured after 6 or 18 months in patients receiving either placebo or pioglitazone correlate less strongly with histological changes than previously believed.

If confirmed in larger studies and with other therapeutic agents, these results indicate that quantification of IHTG content should be used with caution to assess overall response in patients with NASH.

PARAGRAPH

In a prior cross-sectional study, we have reported that IHTG accumulation beyond 4–8% was associated with maximal metabolic impairment.23

Moreover, we showed in that study that further IHTG accumulation was not associated with worse liver histology.

In the current work, we go further to suggest that the magnitude of IHTG change with treatment is not strongly correlated with histological or metabolic changes, at least in patients receiving placebo or thiazolidinedione therapy.

This is in apparent discordance with 2 prior studies that assessed the longitudinal relationship between IHTG and liver histology.

In a 24-week study in 35 patients with biopsy-proven NASH by Patel et al.,18 the investigators noted that changes in IHTG were associated with significant reductions in the NAS.

However, the NAS includes steatosis as one of its parameters.

Therefore, comparing changes of IHTG with changes in NAS are likely to be correlated based on similar changes in steatosis (i.e., collinearity).

Of note, these results were comparable to ours in that there was no association between a reduction in IHTG and individual histological parameters such as inflammation or ballooning.18

We found only a borderline positive relationship between changes in IHTG and lobular inflammation, similar to that observed in patients treated with selonsertib and/or simtuzumab (considered a placebo), and where changes in MRI-PDFF were not strong predictors of improvement in hepatocyte ballooning or fibrosis.19

In that study, the AUC to predict NAS response was identical to that to predict steatosis response (both were 0.70), strongly suggesting collinearity between both measurements.

In order to avoid this in the current work, we used resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis as the histological outcome, which is less dependent of changes in steatosis.

PARAGRAPH

Another potential reason for the positive findings in prior studies was the combination of patients on placebo (or simtuzumab) with patients on active treatment.18,19

In our cohort of patients, when analyses were performed combining patients receiving placebo and active treatment, results were misleading as they suggested that there was a strong association between changes in IHTG content and histological changes.

This is expected, as most patients on pioglitazone had reductions in IHTG content (45 out of 63 had >50% reduction), on insulin resistance, A1c, and histological improvement.

On the contrary, patients on placebo showed no changes in IHTG, insulin resistance, A1c, histology.

Therefore, when combining patients on pioglitazone and placebo, associations between metabolic variables were significant as a result of having 2 heterogeneous and extreme populations.

This results in a significant overestimation of the association coefficient.

In fact, no association was observed between changes in IHTG content and histological response when a 2-way ANOVA was performed adjusting for treatment arm.

Moreover, stratifying patients based on whether they received placebo or pioglitazone resulted in the absence of any significant association between IHTG content changes and histological improvement (Figs. 1–3).

Finally, the relationship between changes in steatosis and changes in other histological features may vary depending on the mechanism of action of each intervention.

Lifestyle intervention appears to impact similarly individual histological parameters (steatosis, ballooning and inflammation)27,28 and a recent study reported that the MRI-PDFF response was associated with resolution of NASH, but it did not provide a quantitative analysis of the role of IHTG content reduction.29

PARAGRAPH

The most straightforward implication of these findings is that the use of MRI-PDFF or 1H-MRS cannot be considered as useful as currently believed for the assessment of histological response to treatment.

In addition, it calls for a paradigm shift about individual histological parameters improving in tandem (i.e., changes in steatosis expected to be followed by changes in necroinflammation).

For instance, rosiglitazone (an exclusive PPARγ activator) reduced steatosis but failed to have a significant effect on inflammation or hepatocyte ballooning.30,31

In early drug development there is some expectation that fibrosis is also more likely to improve, at least to some extent, with greater reductions in liver fat.

But the discordance regarding changes in steatosis and fibrosis is now clear.

Cenicriviroc treatment was associated with some improvement in fibrosis, but no changes in steatosis, inflammation or ballooning.7

In the GOLDEN-505 study assessing elafibranor at 2 different doses against placebo, changes in fibrosis were not correlated with changes in steatosis.3

More recently, obeticholic acid improved fibrosis without any correlation with steatosis and no significant resolution of NASH.32

PARAGRAPH

The reason(s) why improvements in IHTG do not more readily translate to other histological improvement remains unclear.

Such a dissociation was also evident in our prior work where disease severity was not different throughout the range of IHTG ranging from 6% to ≥30%, suggesting that steatosis per se is more of a “trigger” than a determinant of disease severity in NASH.23

Of note, complete steatosis resolution (≤5.56%) was not a strong indicator of resolution of NASH (Fig. 2).

PARAGRAPH

It is possible that IHTG-driven lipotoxicity induces changes in hepatocytes, stellate and Kupffer cells, which are not reversible by triglyceride reduction alone, and that they may require additional hormonal or downstream effects on pathways linked to mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, insulin/lipid signaling, or regulation of inflammatory pathways.

In support of this concept, while rosiglitazone and pioglitazone reduce steatosis, only pioglitazone induces improvements in inflammation and ballooning, suggesting accessory mechanisms.4,20,30,31

Another potential hypothesis is that IHTG reduction may require a certain amount of time to promote histological changes.

However, in our placebo-controlled studies, paired biopsies performed at 6 or 18 months of treatment4,20 led to similar histologic and imaging changes, and histological improvement was the same even after 36 months,4 suggesting that time per se is not a reasonable explanation for the differences observed between IHTG content changes and histology.

Moreover, our sensitivity analysis did not find any differences in results when analyses were repeated to separate patients based on duration of follow-up (6 vs. 18 months).

However, it is still possible that histological changes may require an even longer period of time to settle after IHTG reduction.

PARAGRAPH

One may speculate based on a growing body of literature, that triglycerides per se are not harmful and that they may not even be correlated with the accumulation of toxic lipid metabolites that drive hepatocyte lipotoxicity.33,34

Indeed, they may even be protective for the liver, acting as a buffer against the accumulation of lipotoxic diacylglycerols (DAGs),35 ceramides36 or other lipid species.37

Both DAGs and ceramides are emerging as the link between overnutrition and excess FFA/energy supply to the liver and hepatocyte lipotoxicity in NASH.38

Different groups have reported that hepatocyte DAGs are increased in obese patients with NASH.39,40

Also, an increased concentration of ceramide both in plasma and within hepatocytes has been associated with impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and inflammation in patients with obesity and T2DM.41,42

Taking this building evidence into account, it is easier to reconcile why a reduction in IHTG may not directly translate into improvements in inflammation, ballooning, or fibrosis.

The impact of weight loss or pharmacological agents on these lipotoxic metabolites has not been measured in liver tissue in humans, but in animal models of NASH, both GLP-1RAs43 and pioglitazone44 lead to a reduction of DAGs, ceramides and acylcarnitines and metabolic improvement.

PARAGRAPH

In the current work, we have shown that changes in IHTG content after treatment with pioglitazone or placebo do not predict histological or metabolic changes.

The clinical implication of our findings is that MRI-based imaging may not be as reliable as previously believed for the assessment of clinical efficacy of a given intervention in patients with NASH.

However, larger studies and examination of agents with different mechanisms of action are needed to confirm whether this observation is generalizable.

Until such studies become available, randomized controlled trials using IHTG as a surrogate endpoint for broader histological response should be interpreted with caution.
