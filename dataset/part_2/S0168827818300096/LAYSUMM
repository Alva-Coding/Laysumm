TITLE

Effects of the gutâ€“liver axis on ischaemia-mediated hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence in the mouse liver

PARAGRAPH

Cancer recurrence can occur after liver resection or liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

This study suggests that intestinal venous congestion, which often occurs during liver surgery, favors the translocation of gut-derived bacterial products in the portal vein, thereby facilitating cancer recurrence by enhancing the signaling of Toll-like receptor 4 in the liver.

Using a mouse model of HCC recurrence, we show that strategies that (i) reduce bacterial translocation (by gut decontamination, or by protecting the intestine from venous ischemia damage) or (ii) inhibit Tlr4 signaling in the liver, could reduce cancer recurrence.
