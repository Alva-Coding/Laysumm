TITLE

Estimate of hepatocellular carcinoma incidence in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis

PARAGRAPH

Cirrhosis is a risk factor for primary liver cancer, leading to recommendations for periodic screening.

However, for alcohol-related liver disease the rational of periodic screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial, as registry and databased studies have suggested a low incidence of HCC in these patients and highly competitive mortality rates.

In this study, a large cohort of patients with biopsy-proven alcoholic cirrhosis prospectively screened for HCC demonstrated a high annual incidence of HCC (2.9%) and a high percentage of small cancers theoretically eligible for curative treatment.

This suggests that patients with liver disease related to alcohol should not be ruled out of screening.
