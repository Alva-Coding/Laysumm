TITLE

Hepatitis C virus reinfection after successful treatment with direct-acting antiviral therapy in a large population-based cohort

PARAGRAPH

Direct-acting antivirals are an effective tool for the treatment of hepatitis C virus, enabling the elimination of the virus.

However, some patients who have been successfully treated with direct-acting antivirals are at risk of reinfection.

Our findings showed that the risk of reinfection was highest among people with recent injection drug use.

Among people who inject drugs, daily use of opioid-agonist therapy was associated with a lower risk of reinfection.
