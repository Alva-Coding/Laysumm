ABSTRACT

TITLE

Hepatitis C virus reinfection after successful treatment with direct-acting antiviral therapy in a large population-based cohort

PARAGRAPH

Direct-acting antiviral therapies (DAA) are an important tool for hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination.

However, reinfection among people who inject drugs (PWID) may hamper elimination targets.

Therefore, we estimated HCV reinfection rates among DAA-treated individuals, including PWID.

PARAGRAPH

We analyzed data from the British Columbia Hepatitis Testers Cohort which included ∼1.7 million individuals screened for HCV in British Columbia, Canada.

We followed HCV-infected individuals treated with DAAs who achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR) and had ≥1 subsequent HCV RNA measurement to April 22nd, 2018.

Reinfection was defined as a positive RNA measurement after SVR.

PWID were identified using a validated algorithm and classified based on recent (<3 years) or former (≥3 years before SVR) use.

Crude reinfection rates per 100 person-years (PYs) were calculated.

Poisson regression was used to model adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% CIs.

PARAGRAPH

Of 4,114 individuals who met the inclusion criteria, most were male (n = 2,692, 65%), born before 1965 (n = 3,411, 83%) and were either recent (n = 875, 21%) or former PWID (n = 1,793, 44%).

Opioid-agonist therapy (OAT) was received by 19% of PWID.

We identified 40 reinfections during 2,767 PYs.

Reinfection rates were higher among recent (3.1/100 PYs; IRR 6.7; 95% CI 1.9–23.5) and former PWID (1.4/100 PYs; IRR 3.7; 95% CI 1.1–12.9) than non-PWID (0.3/100 PYs).

Among recent PWID, reinfection rates were higher among individuals born after 1975 (10.2/100 PYs) and those co-infected with HIV (5.7/100 PYs).

Only one PWID receiving daily OAT developed reinfection.

PARAGRAPH

Population-level reinfection rates remain elevated after DAA therapy among PWID because of ongoing exposure risk.

Engagement of PWID in harm-reduction and support services is needed to prevent reinfections.
