TITLE

Direct-acting antivirals after successful treatment of early hepatocellular carcinoma improve survival in HCV-cirrhotic patients

PARAGRAPH

We aimed to determine whether direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) significantly improve overall survival in patients with hepatitis C virus-related compensated cirrhosis and a first diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) which has been successfully treated with curative resection or ablation.

Using propensity-score matched patients, we found that DAAs improved overall survival and reduced the risk of hepatic decompensation.

However, the risk of HCC recurrence was not significantly reduced.
