TITLE

Fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibition induces loss of matrix MCL1 and necrosis in cholangiocarcinoma

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a lethal hepatobiliary malignancy with limited therapeutic options.1,2

Advances in CCA therapy will require an understanding of oncogenic signalling networks that contribute to CCA pathogenesis and could be disrupted therapeutically.

Similar to other malignancies, a cardinal feature of CCA is inhibition of cell death pathways that are engaged by oncogenic signalling pathways.3

Members of the BCL2 gene family encode proteins that regulate the mitochondrial or intrinsic apoptotic pathway.4

Of the BCL2 prosurvival members, myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) is most frequently amplified and overexpressed in CCA,5–7 and has a pivotal role in CCA cell survival.8

Hence, targeting MCL1 is a strategy for the treatment of CCA and other malignancies.9,10

PARAGRAPH

Anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins, such as MCL1, block cell death by binding pro-apoptotic BCL2 effectors, such as BAX, BAK, or BCL2 homology-3 (BH3)-only proteins.4

By sequestering these proteins on the outer mitochondrial membrane, MCL1 effectively blocks mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation (MOMP), a requisite event for the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.4

However, in addition to residing on the outer mitochondrial membrane, MCL1 can also undergo proteolytic processing at its N terminus to generate a truncated species that translocates to, and localises within, the mitochondrial matrix.11–14

Whereas full-length MCL1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane functions as an anti-apoptotic protein, N-terminal-truncated MCL1 within the mitochondrial matrix regulates mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and dynamics.14

PARAGRAPH

Recently, it was reported that pharmacological inhibition of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signalling resulted in cell death that was accompanied by loss of MCL1 mRNA and protein, and was rescued by enforced MCL1 expression.15

However, the cell death process was not characterised by morphological features of apoptosis, and biochemically was accompanied by reductions in cellular oxygen consumption and cellular ATP levels, observations more consistent with cell death by necrosis than by apoptosis.16

The mode of cell death is therapeutically relevant, because it provides mechanistic insight for the development of combinatorial therapy.

For example, necrosis is thought to be a more immunogenic cell death than is apoptosis, and combining immunotherapy with drugs inducing necrosis could be synergistic.

PARAGRAPH

Herein, we explore the mode of cell death during FGFR inhibition in human CCA cells.

These studies revealed that FGFR pharmacological inhibition resulted in impairment of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and diminished ATP levels followed by a non-apoptotic cell death that was rescued by enforced expression of an N-terminus-truncated MCL1 targeted to the mitochondrial matrix.

These observations suggest that, in addition to its anti-apoptotic role, MCL1 also has an alternative survival function, namely prevention of cell necrosis.

The human CCA cell lines KMCH-1 (hereafter referred to as KMCH) and KMBC-1 (hereafter referred to as KMBC), which have been previously described,17,18 and human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines PANC-1 and DanG were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Panc04.03 and BxPC-3 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco), HepG2 cells were cultured in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (Gibco), and HT-29 cells were cultured in McCoy’s 5a medium (Gibco).

DanG was obtained from Leibniz Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany).

All cell lines, except for KMCH, KMBC, and DanG, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).

Cell death assays

PARAGRAPH

To evaluate cytotoxicity, cells were grown in 96-well plates (5 × 103 cells per well) and assayed for survival using several different assays, each of which was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

These assays included: MTS [3,4-(5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt] assay (CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution cell proliferation assay, Promega, Madison, WI, USA); Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay (In Vitro Toxicology Assay Kit Sulforhodamine B Based, SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), CellTiter-Blue assay (CellTiter-Blue Cell Viability Assay, Promega); and CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega).

Cell death in KMCH cells was also characterised by annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) labelling using flow cytometry.

KMCH cells were plated and treated with 5 µM obatoclax plus 20 ng/ml TRAIL or 5 µM LY for 24 h. Using the Alexa Fluor® 488 annexin V/Dead cell apoptosis kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), dual staining with annexin V and PI was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Trypsinised cells were washed in PBS and suspended at 1 × 106/ml in annexin-binding buffer.

After staining, flow-cytometric analysis was carried out on a FACS Canto (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).

SECTION

CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing

PARAGRAPH

The sequences of sgRNA for BAX and BAK were designed using an online CRISPR design tool (http://crispr.mit.edu).

They included a four-base pair (bp) overhang for the forward (ccgg) and complementary reverse (aaac) oligos to enable cloning into pGuide-it-ZsGreen1 (for BAX) or pGuide-it-tdTomato (for BAK) vector (Clontech).

These vectors were transiently transfected into KMCH cells using the FuGene HD reagent (Promega).

Dual-positive ZsGreen and tdTomato cells were sorted on a single cell basis into single wells of a 96-well plate using flow cytometry.

The sgRNA sequences are as follows: BAX exon 2: 5′-CTGCAGGATGATTGCCGCCG-3′; BAK exon 4: 5′- ACGGCAGCTCGCCATCATCG-3′.

An FgH1tMCL1 plasmid (for inducible expression of sgRNA) was generated as described previously.21

The sequences of sgRNAs for MCL1 (sgMCL1#1 and sgMCL1#2) have been described elsewhere.21

To produce lentiviruses, FgH1tMCL1 or FUCas9Cherry plasmids were transiently co-transfected into HEK293T cells with the packaging plasmids pMDLg/pRRE, pRSV-rev, and pCMV-VSV-G (all from Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA) using the FuGene HD reagent.

Harvested lentiviruses were passed through a 0.45-µm filter; KMCH cells were transduced with the lentiviral constructs in the presence of 8 µg/ml polybrene for 24 h.

After transduction, m-cherry (Cas9) and GFP (inducible-sgRNA) dual-positive cells were sorted on a single cell basis into individual wells of a 96-well plate using flow cytometry.

To induce sgRNA expression in cells, doxycycline hyclate was added to culture medium at a final concentration of 5 µg/ml.

The efficiency of all CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene deletions was examined by immunoblot analysis.

PARAGRAPH

Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany).

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using the SuperScript First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Real-time PCR was performed using the SYBR Green system on a Light Cycler 480 instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Risch-Rotkreuz, Switzerland).

Target gene expression was calculated by the ΔΔCt method and normalised to 18S ribosomal RNA expression levels.

General PCR was performed using PrimeSTAR Max DNA polymerase (Clontech).

SECTION

Mitochondria isolation and trypsin treatment

PARAGRAPH

Mitochondria were isolated from KMCH and KMBC cells using a Mitochondria Isolation Kit for Cultured Cells (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Following isolation, mitochondria were incubated with 50 µg/ml trypsin for 20 min on ice.

Trypsin was then inhibited by adding soybean trypsin inhibitor (200 µg/ml) for 5 min on ice.

SECTION

Plasmids, expression constructs, and generation of mutants

PARAGRAPH

The plasmid encoding S peptide-tagged MCL1 was subcloned into pcDNA as previously described.22

To generate outer mitochondrial membrane MCL1 (MCL1OM), arginine 6 was substituted with alanine utilising a Q5 site-directed Mutagenesis kit (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA).

The N-terminal 86 amino acids of MCL1 were deleted by PCR using PrimeSTAR Max DNA polymerase (Clontech), and fused to the N-terminal 58 amino acids of Neurospora crassa ATP-synthase-encoded Gblocks (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) using Gibson Assembly Master Mix (New England BioLabs) to generate matrix MCL1 (MCL1Matrix), as described by Perciavalle et al.14 All MCL1 mutants were subcloned into pLenti plasmids (OriGene, Rockville, MD, USA).

To generate stable transfectants, HEK 293T cells were transfected with pCMV-VSV-G (Addgene), pCMV-dR8.2 dvpr (Addgene), and the lentiviral MCL1OM, MCL1Matrix or empty vector, using FuGene HD reagent.

After 48 h and 72 h, the supernatant was passed through a 0.45-µm pore filter, and Polybrene (Sigma Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 8 μg/ml.

Target KMCH cells were incubated with lentivirus-containing medium from the HEK 293 T cells for 24 h before the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium.

Cells were cultured for an additional three days in lentivirus-free media, and then placed into selection medium containing 5 µg/ml puromycin.

Expression of MCL1 mutants was confirmed by immunoblot analysis.

SECTION

ATP assay

PARAGRAPH

Cells were plated in 24-well plates (2 × 104 cells per well) and LY was added for 6 h. Cellular ATP levels in KMCH cells were measured by a commercial fluorometric assay (BioVision, Milpitas, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Fluorescence was measured using a multidetection microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).

ATP concentration was determined by comparing values to a standard curve.

SECTION

Extracellular flux analysis of overall oxygen consumption rates

PARAGRAPH

Mitochondrial respiration was assessed using an XF24 extracellular flux analyser (Seahorse Biosciences) as described by Wu et al.23 Briefly, MCL1OM- and MCL1Matrix-expressing cells were seeded in XF-24 cell culture plates (Seahorse Bioscience, Billerica, MA, USA) at 7 × 104 cells/well and incubated under standard conditions for 24 h. Beginning 6 h before the measurement, cells were treated with or without LY.

Thereafter, the cells were washed with XF Base DMEM (Seahorse Bioscience) containing 25 mM glucose and 10 mM pyruvate.

The overall oxygen consumption rate was measured sequentially after addition of 1 µM oligomycin, 0.2 µM FCCP and 1 µM rotenone plus 1 µM antimycin A. Experiments were conducted using five replicates for each condition and repeated in three independent experiments.

At the end of the experiments, cells were harvested and protein measured by the Bradford protein assay.

Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) values were normalised to the protein content of each well.

Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) measurements

PARAGRAPH

Cells were plated on BIOCOAT 96 well plates (Falcon, Corning, NY, USA) and treated with vehicle or 5 µM LY for 6 h.

After tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) (Invitrogen) was added to cells at a final concentration of 100 nM, incubation was continued for 20 min.

Fluorescence was measured at Excitation/Emission wave lengths of 560 nm/590 nm on a BIOTEK Synergy fluorescent plate reader.

Then, 50 µM 1799 (Dupont, Wilmington, DE, USA), a non-fluorescent mitochondrial uncoupler, was added and incubation was continued for an additional 20 min.

Mitochondrial membrane (Δψm) values were expressed as a percentage of the same time vehicle control using Eq. (1):Δψm=[(experimental fluorescence-uncoupled fluorescence)/(control fluorescence-uncoupled fluorescence)]×100

Patient-derived xenograft model

PARAGRAPH

This study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Ethics Committee (Institutional Review Board #66-06) and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and all human subjects gave written informed consent for participation in medical research.

Patient-derived xenografts (PDX), from an individual patient with intrahepatic CCA, were implanted in 6–8-week-old male NOD/SCID mice (Charles River, strain code: 394) as previously described.15,24

Briefly, after mice were anesthetised with 1.5–3% isoflurane, an incision was made in the flank area in the middle of the thigh line and enlarged to 0.5 cm.

Following implantation of a tissue fragment (1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm) into a pocket created under the flank fat pad, the incision was sealed with Vetbond™ (3M).

Once the diameter of the tumours reached 1 cm, mice were randomly divided into two groups (vehicle: n = 5, LY: n = 7) and treated with either vehicle (2% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose) or LY (3 mg/kg) via oral gavage twice daily for seven days, as described previously.25

At the end of the treatment, all mice were sacrificed and tumour tissue was obtained for further studies.

Mice were housed on a 12-h light–dark cycle and fed a normal chow diet.

All animal experiments were performed in accordance with a protocol approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Results

SECTION

The pan-FGFR inhibitor, LY2874455, induces necrosis in human cholangiocarcinoma cells

PARAGRAPH

The pan-FGFR inhibitor LY25 was used for these studies.

To confirm that LY inhibits FGFR signalling, we examined phosphorylation of the common FGFR receptor substrate, FGF receptor substrate 2 (FRS2), in KMCH and KMBC cells.

As indicated in Fig. 1A, FRS2 was phosphorylated in both CCA cell lines at baseline; and incubation with LY blocked this phosphorylation, indicating inhibition of FGFR signalling cascades.

PARAGRAPH

Further studies demonstrated that LY also induced cell death in both the KMCH and KMBC cell lines (Fig. 1B).

Interestingly, this LY-induced death process was not blocked by necrostatin-1, a receptor-interacting protein (RIP) 1 kinase inhibitor, which blocks necroptosis,19 nor by the potent caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh26 (Fig. 1C).

PARAGRAPH

To further characterise the LY-induced death process, we compared it to cell death induced by obatoclax plus TRAIL, a combination that induces apoptosis in CCA cells, as previously reported.20

Cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which is mediated by active caspases,27,28 was detected in the presence of obatoclax plus TRAIL but not LY (Fig. 1D).

Likewise, deletion of genes encoding BAX and BAK, pro-apoptotic effector proteins necessary for activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, using CRISPR/Cas929 diminished cell death induced by obatoclax plus TRAIL but not LY-induced cell death (Fig. 1E).

Flow cytometry after staining with annexin V plus PI revealed that obatoclax plus TRAIL treatment increased the annexin V single-positive population (Fig. 1F), indicative of apoptosis, whereas LY treatment significantly increased the annexin V and PI dual-positive cell population, suggesting plasma membrane rupture.

PARAGRAPH

Given that a necrotic mode of cell death was occurring in LY-treated CCA cells, we next sought to examine our model for potential necroptosis signalling processes.

In necroptosis, formation of the necrosome, a complex comprising RIP1, RIP3, and FAS-associated protein, results in the phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) and cell membrane permeabilisation.30,31

To induce necroptosis, cells were treated with ZVAD-fmk, TNF-α, and TL-32711 with or without necrostatin-1.

However, expression of MLKL and RIP3 was absent in the KMCH and KMBC cells, whereas both proteins were readily identified in the HT29 cells, a positive control for necroptosis (Fig. 1G).

These results suggest that necroptosis was not a mode of cell death in LY-treated CCA cells.

Taken together, these data suggest that FGFR inhibition mediates predominantly a non-apoptotic cell death most compatible with necrosis in human CCA cells.

Finally, LY-induced cell death was also assessed in a malignant hepatocyte-derived cell line, HepG2 cells, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells (PDAC).

Whereas HepG2 cells were resistant to LY-mediated cell death, the PDAC cell lines, PANC1, BxPC3, DanG, and Panc 04.03, were susceptible to LY-triggered cell death (Fig. S1A).

SECTION

FGFR inhibition depletes both outer mitochondrial membrane and matrix MCL1 species in human CCA cells

PARAGRAPH

Consistent with a previous report that the pan-FGFR inhibitor BGJ398 results in depletion of total cellular MCL1 in human CCA cells because of downregulation of MCL1 mRNA,15 we observed that LY treatment also resulted in loss of MCL1 mRNA and protein (Fig. 2).

Importantly, both the full-length and truncated MCL1 species decreased in a dose- (Fig. 2A) and time-dependent (Fig. 2B) manner.

PARAGRAPH

To assess the impact of the decreased MCL1 species, we genetically deleted MCL1 in KMCH cells using a doxycycline-inducible sgRNA expression system.21

Following doxycycline treatment, both MCL1 species were deleted within 24 h (Fig. 2C, lower panel).

MCL1-deleted KMCH cells underwent cell death in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2C, upper panel), suggesting that loss of MCL1 species is sufficient to induce cell death.

PARAGRAPH

In further experiments, we assessed the submitochondrial distribution of the two MCL1 species.

Mitochondria were isolated from KMCH cells and treated with trypsin, reasoning that outer mitochondrial membrane proteins would undergo proteolytic degradation whereas the matrix proteins would be protected.

Using the mitochondrial translocases TOM70 and TIMM50 as markers of the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, respectively,32 this analysis demonstrated that TOM70, but not TIMM50, was susceptible to trypsin proteolysis.

Consistent with a location on the outer mitochondrial membrane, the larger MCL1 species also underwent efficient proteolytic degradation, whereas the lower-molecular-weight species was more resistant to trypsin digestion (Fig. 3A).

PARAGRAPH

Prior studies suggested that full-length MCL1 also undergoes more rapid cellular depletion than the matrix species in the presence of cycloheximide (i.e. the half-life of the full-length protein is shorter than that of the truncated protein).11,12

Consistent with these prior studies, incubation of KMCH cells with cycloheximide resulted in more rapid loss of full-length MCL1 compared with the truncated species (Fig. 3B).

PARAGRAPH

Collectively, these results are consistent with the presence of full-length MCL1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane and a truncated MCL1 species within the mitochondrial matrix in human CCA cells.

Both MCL1 species were decreased following incubation with LY, likely reflecting diminished MCL1 transcription as represented by rapid depletion of cellular MCL1 mRNA.9

SECTION

Matrix MCL1 regulates CCA cell death by modulating mitochondrial oxidative metabolism

PARAGRAPH

To assess whether loss of mitochondrial outer membrane MCL1 vs. matrix MCL1 contributed preferentially to LY-induced cell death, using the CMV promoter we expressed MCL1 targeted to the mitochondrial outer membrane or matrix in KMCH cells from plasmids (Fig. 4A) and assessed the ability of the constructs to rescue the cells.

MCL1 targeted to the mitochondrial matrix (MCL1Matrix) was generated by fusing the mitochondrial targeting sequence of matrix-localised ATP synthase to N-truncated MCL1, producing a mutant that resides solely within the mitochondrial matrix and is incapable of blocking apoptosis.14

Mutagenesis of the highly conserved arginine residue of MCL1 at position 6 to alanine generated MCL1OM, which maintains its localisation on the outer mitochondrial membrane.14

LY significantly reduced endogenous MCL1 expression in mock transfected cells, but the two exogenous constructs continued to be expressed (Fig. 4B).

Importantly, KMCH cells stably transfected with MCL1Matrix were resistant to cell death during LY incubation, whereas cells stably transfected with MCL1OM were not protected from cell death (Fig. 4C).

In an effort to complement these data, we attempted to demonstrate MCL1 in the mitochondrial outer membrane and mitoplasts using mitochondrial subfractionation.

However, after extensive attempts using a multitude of published approaches, we were unable to isolate mitoplasts without outer membrane contamination.

One possible explanation for this is that, unlike non-malignant cells, cancer cell mitochondria might not demonstrate high-amplitude swelling in the presence of hypotonic buffers or permit separation of the two membranes.

The contact sites between the outer and inner membranes are abundant and ‘tight’ in these mitochondria, precluding complete separation of the two membranes.

PARAGRAPH

Further experiments designed to investigate the mechanistic basis for this protection evaluated the impact of MCL1OM and MCL1Matrix on mitochondrial function.

Cellular ATP levels, OCR, and ATP production rate all decreased with FGFR inhibition; however, these mitochondrial functional deficits were largely restored by expression of MCL1Matrix (Fig. 4D and E).

By contrast, enforced expression of MCL1OM had no effect on FGFR inhibitor-induced impairment of mitochondrial oxidative function (Fig. 4D and E).

PARAGRAPH

To provide an explanation for these findings, we also examined mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm).

Opening of the inner mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore results in a collapse of ion gradients across this membrane, thereby impairing oxidative phosphorylation, and is a potential explanation for our observations.33

Loss of Δψm is used to assess the opening of this pore.34

Therefore, we initially examined Δψm during FGFR inhibition in wild-type and BA−/−BAK−/− cells, which are protected from BH3-only protein-induced mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation, to assess whether this was the cause of impaired oxidative phosphorylation.

During FGFR inhibition, MCL1Matrix-enforced expression conserved Δψm, whereas MCL1OM transfected cells underwent a reduction in Δψm (Fig. 4F).

Impairment of the electron transport chain during oxidative phosphorylation results in the enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).35,36

Accordingly, we observed that LY treatment resulted in a significant increase in ROS generation in CCA cells (Fig. 4G).

These observations are most compatible with cell death by necrosis resulting from inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, a function apparently regulated by mitochondrial matrix levels of MCL1.

SECTION

FGFR plus selective MCL1 inhibition is neither antagonistic nor synergistic in regard to CCA cell death

PARAGRAPH

Having gained insight into mechanisms of CCA cell death by FGFR inhibition, we next examined the possibility that inhibiting the anti-apoptotic function of MCL1 might also modulate LY cytotoxicity.

In particular, we sought to determine whether combining LY with an MCL1-targeting BH3 mimetic would be antagonistic, because MCL1-targeting BH3 mimetics increase MCL1 protein levels,37 or synergistic by promoting both apoptosis and necrosis.

For these studies, we used A-1210477, a selective MCL1 inhibitor that binds with high affinity to the BH3 groove on the MCL1 protein.37

As reported previously,37 A-1210477 resulted in an increase in cellular MCL1 protein levels by stabilizing the protein at a post-translational level (Fig. 5A).

However, A-1210477 did not prevent cellular loss of MCL1 by LY, consistent with the effect of LY on inhibiting MCL1 transcription (Fig. 5A).

There was modest CCA cell death with A-1210477 treatment alone in KMCH and KMBC cells (Fig. 5B).

By comparison, LY resulted in greater cytotoxicity.

The combination of LY and A-1210477 was neither antagonistic nor synergistic in inducing CCA cell death (Fig. 5B).

Hence, LY is more cytotoxic than A-1210477, suggesting that cellular loss of MCL1 is more deleterious compared with inhibiting its anti-apoptotic function.

SECTION

FGFR inhibition reduces tumour burden in a patient-derived xenograft model of CCA

PARAGRAPH

After CCA PDXs were implanted heterotopically and allowed to grow to ∼1 cm in diameter, mice were treated for one week with LY.

This PDX constitutively expressed FGFR1–4 mRNA (Fig. 6A); and FRS2 (a proximate substrate of FGFR tyrosine kinase activity) was phosphorylated in the PDX (Fig. 6B), indicating active FGFR expression and signalling.

Also, the dose of LY was sufficient to reduce FRS2 phosphorylation in the PDX, indicating pharmacological FGFR inhibition at achievable drug concentrations (Fig. 6B).

LY treatment was tumour suppressive with this short duration of treatment, because the tumours from LY-treated mice were smaller by weight vs. those from vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 6C).

The LY-treated tumours also displayed areas of cellular necrosis by haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (Fig. 6D).

Moreover, tumour area, as examined by morphometric analysis of SOX9 immunohistochemistry, was correspondingly reduced in the LY-treated PDX (Fig. 6E).

MCL1 expression by immunohistochemistry, albeit variable, was also decreased in the LY- vs. vehicle-treated PDXs (Fig. 6F).

LY treatment was not associated with hepatobiliary toxicity, as indicated by normal serum levels of aminotransferases and absence of histological damage in tissues, including specific examination of cholangiocytes (Fig. S2A and B).

Thus, FGFR inhibition by LY in vivo was cytotoxic for CCA cells, but not for hepatocytes nor cholangiocytes, by a process that appears to be similar to in vitro observations.

The principal findings of this study provide new mechanistic insight regarding the contribution of matrix MCL1 to cell survival in human CCA cells.

Our results indicate the following when cell death is induced by FGFR inhibition: (i) the model of cell death is predominantly necrotic rather than apoptotic, and accompanied by a reduction in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism; (ii) mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and cell death are rescued by targeting MCL1 to the mitochondrial matrix, but not by targeting it to the outer mitochondrial membrane; and (iii) FGFR inhibition induces necrosis in human CCA PDX models.

These observations are discussed in greater detail below.

PARAGRAPH

In these studies, we used pharmacological FGFR inhibition as a highly relevant model to induce CCA cell death.

Oncogenic FGFR signalling has been strongly implicated in CCA biology.

For example, FGFR2 fusion genes have been reported in human CCA by several investigators and mediate oncogenic behaviour (e.g. cell proliferation, invasion, etc.); FGFR2 inhibition appears to be therapeutic for these cancers.38,39

A FGFR and Hippo autocrine, feed-forward, oncogenic signalling pathway has also been reported to participate in CCA pathogenesis in the absence of the fusion aberrations.15

FGFR inhibition is therapeutic in PDX models characterised by this feed-forward signalling pathway.15

Given these preclinical and clinical observations, several FGFR inhibitors are also being developed for the treatment of human cancers, including CCA.40,41

Hence, examining the pathways and mode of cell death by FGFR inhibition is pertinent to the therapy of human CCA.

PARAGRAPH

It was previously reported that FGFR pharmacological inhibition induced CCA cell death through interruption of an MCL1-regulated survival pathway.15

Cell death was accompanied by loss of MCL1 mRNA and protein, and rescued by enforced expression of MCL1.

However, neither the mode nor mechanism(s) of cell death was robustly delineated.

Herein, we explored the mechanism(s) of this MCL1-regulated cell death in the context of FGFR inhibition to gain further therapeutic insight.

Unexpectedly, cell death in human CCA cells by FGFR inhibition was not apoptotic despite cellular loss of MCL1.

Evidence for a non-apoptotic mode of cell death included the inability to identify caspase activation and lack of cell death inhibition by a caspase inhibitor or genetically depletion of BAX and BAK.

Moreover, A-1210477, a pharmacological agent that blocks MCL1 anti-apoptotic function without decreasing protein levels, caused only modest cytotoxicity.

Necroptosis is a mode of cell death mediated by RIP1 and -3 kinases independent of caspase activation,42 and is blocked by pharmacological inhibition of RIP1 kinase with necrostatin-1.19

However, in our model, necrostatin-1 also did not prevent CCA death by FGFR inhibition.

Moreover, key mediators of necroptosis, MLKL and RIP3, were not expressed in the CCA cells lines, excluding necroptosis as a mediator of cell death during LY treatment.

By contrast, cell death was characterised by reductions in mitochondrial respiration, loss of cellular ATP, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), and increased generation of ROS.

The loss of Δψm occurred despite genetic deletion of BAX and BAK, indicating that it is unlikely to be secondary to outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilisation.

The loss of Δψm, decrease in cellular ATP, and impaired mitochondrial respiration observed in the current studies are most consistent with cell death following formation of the inner mitochondrial membrane permeabilisation transition pore.33,43

Opening of this transition pore is a common mechanism of cell death by necrosis.

Collectively, these observations suggest a defect in mitochondrial matrix function as a cause of the cell death in CCA cells after LY treatment, likely by necrosis.

PARAGRAPH

Previous observations, coupled with the results presented, suggest that MCL1 loss disrupts mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in the matrix, leading to the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.

By contrast, MCL1 is typically viewed as a regulator of apoptosis.

To reconcile these findings, we postulated that loss of the previously described N-truncated matrix species of MCL1 might have a role in LY-induced cell death.

Indeed, enforced expression of full-length MCL1 targeted to the outer mitochondrial membrane failed to block LY-induced repression of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and cell death.

By contrast, enforced expression of a N-terminus-truncated form of MCL1 to the mitochondrial matrix rescued adverse effects of LY on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and cell death.

These observations are consistent with the known effects of reducing matrix MCL1 species causing reduced protein expression of COX1 and COX2 subunits, alterations in the large supercomplexes containing complexes I, III, and IV, and efficient assembly of F1F0-ATP synthase oligomers.14

These results suggest that MCL1 has multiple survival functions and can prevent both apoptosis and necrosis, albeit by distinct mechanisms.

PARAGRAPH

Previous studies have demonstrated that BCL2, which is widely viewed as a regulator of apoptosis, can regulate necrosis under certain circumstances.44,45

To our knowledge, the present study is the first to implicate MCL1 in the regulation of anticancer drug-induced necrotic cell death.

The current results cannot be simply attributed to inhibition of MCL1 expression by LY, because similar effects were observed with BGJ398 in a prior study,15 namely cellular depletion of MCL1, inhibition of cellular oxygen consumption rates, and loss of cellular ATP.

This mode and mechanism of cell death secondary to MCL1 depletion is potentially important.

Cell death by necrosis would not only bypass intrinsic anti-apoptotic cellular resistance mechanisms, but might also induce a strong immunological anti-tumour response, a desired effect of anticancer therapy.46

Indeed, necrosis elicits an inflammatory response and can lead to an immunogenic cell death and, as such, might be synergistic with immunotherapy paradigms.46,47
