TITLE

Fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibition induces loss of matrix MCL1 and necrosis in cholangiocarcinoma

PARAGRAPH

Herein, we report that therapeutic inhibition of a cell receptor expressed by bile duct cancer cells resulted in the loss of a critical survival protein termed MCL1.

Cellular depletion of MCL1 resulted in the death of the cancer cells by a process characterised by cell rupture.

Cell death by this process can stimulate the immune system and has implications for combination therapy using receptor inhibition with immunotherapy
