TITLE

High efficacy of resistance-guided retreatment of HCV patients failing NS5A inhibitors in the real world

PARAGRAPH

Hepatitis C infection can be cured with currently available antiviral agents.

Only a small proportion of patients experience treatment failure, however, in absolute numbers, a high number of patients may require retreatment.

Highly effective combinations of antivirals are also available for retreatment.

However, these antivirals might not be available in resource-limited settings.

Herein, we show how, by analyzing the cause of resistance, retreatment efficacy with old drugs can get very close to the efficacy of new drug combinations.
