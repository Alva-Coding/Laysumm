TITLE

Antiviral therapy in hepatitis B virus-infected children with immune-tolerant characteristics: A pilot open-label randomized study

PARAGRAPH

There is a lack of data regarding treatment of immune-tolerant chronic hepatitis B (CHB).

It remains unresolved how children with immune-tolerant CHB should be treated.

This paper reports the outcomes from a pilot open-label randomized controlled trial on antiviral therapy in children with immune-tolerant characteristics.

It shows that a sequential combination of interferon-Î± and lamivudine was beneficial.
