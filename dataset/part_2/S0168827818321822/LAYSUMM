TITLE

Identification of a xenobiotic as a potential environmental trigger in primary biliary cholangitis

PARAGRAPH

Primary biliary cholangitis is a liver disease in which most patients have antibodies to mitochondrial proteins containing lipoic acid binding site(s).

This paper identified a man-made chemical present in soils around a waste site.

It was then shown that this chemical was metabolized into a product with structural similarity to lipoic acid, which was capable of replacing lipoic acid in mitochondrial proteins.
