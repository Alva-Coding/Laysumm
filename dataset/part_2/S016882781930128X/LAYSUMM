TITLE

Cross-genotype AR3-specific neutralizing antibodies confer long-term protection in injecting drug users after HCV clearance

PARAGRAPH

Although effective treatments against hepatitis C virus (HCV) are available, 500,000 people die from liver disease caused by HCV each year and approximately 1.75 million people are newly infected.

This could be prevented by a vaccine.

To design a vaccine against HCV, more insight into the role of antibodies in the protection against HCV infection is needed.

In a cohort of injecting drug users, we found that antibodies interfering with virus cell entry, and recognizing multiple HCV genotypes, conferred long-term protection against chronic HCV infection.
