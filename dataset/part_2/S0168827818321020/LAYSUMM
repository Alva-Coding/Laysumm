TITLE

Development of a simple score based on HBeAg and ALT for selecting patients for HBV treatment in Africa

PARAGRAPH

Limited access to the diagnostic tools used to assess treatment eligibility (liver biopsy/Fibroscan/hepatitis B virus DNA) has been an obstacle to the scale up of hepatitis B treatment programs in low- and middle-income countries.

Using the data from African patients with chronic HBV infection, we developed and validated a new simple diagnostic score for treatment eligibility, which only consists of hepatitis B virus e antigen and alanine aminotransferase level.

The diagnostic accuracy of the score for selecting patients for HBV treatment was high and could be useful in African settings.
