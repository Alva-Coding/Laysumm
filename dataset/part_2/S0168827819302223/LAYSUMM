TITLE

A multicenter study of entecavir vs. tenofovir on prognosis of treatment-na√Øve chronic hepatitis B in South Korea

PARAGRAPH

It is currently unclear which antiviral agent, entecavir or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, is superior for improving prognosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection.

In this analysis we found that there was no difference in terms of overall prognosis, including risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, death, or the need for a liver transplant, in patients receiving either antiviral.
