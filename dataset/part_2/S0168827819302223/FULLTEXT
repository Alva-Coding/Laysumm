TITLE

A multicenter study of entecavir vs. tenofovir on prognosis of treatment-naïve chronic hepatitis B in South Korea

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is the most common chronic viral infection worldwide, affecting approximately 350 million people.1

Because persistently high hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication is associated with an increased risk of compensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),2,3 replication-suppressing antiviral therapy is administered to patients with CHB to prevent liver-disease progression.4

As a matter of fact, oral antiviral agents, particularly entecavir (ETV), reduce the risk of long-term complications such as cirrhosis and HCC, ultimately improving survival compared to controls.5,6

Nevertheless, because HBV is rarely eradicated from hepatocytes, most patients with CHB require long-term antiviral therapy.7,8

PARAGRAPH

Entecavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) are potent nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs) with a high genetic barrier to resistance.4,9

Because these 2 antivirals have similar short to intermediate-term clinical efficacy (including virologic, biochemical, serologic, and histologic responses), they are recommended by international practice guidelines as first-line antiviral agents for CHB, together with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF).4,9,10

Furthermore, ETV and TDF have similar efficacy for preventing liver-disease progression,11–14 consistent with their similar antiviral effects in treatment-naïve patients with CHB.15–18

Furthermore, effective rescue regimens may offset the potential hazard of virologic breakthrough or genotypic resistance in a very small proportion of patients treated with ETV.19,20

PARAGRAPH

Choi et al.,21 using the database of the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) of South Korea, reported that TDF is associated with a significantly lower risk of HCC (hazard ratio [HR] 0.61) and all-cause mortality or orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) (HR 0.77) compared to ETV in multivariate analysis.

However, from a hospital-based validation cohort, TDF reduced the risk of HCC with a marginal significance (p = 0.04) and did not prevent all-cause mortality or OLT (p = 0.44).

PARAGRAPH

Here, in this large-scale, multicenter cohort study conducted in 4 academic teaching hospitals in South Korea, we assessed the efficacy of ETV and TDF, as first-line antivirals in treatment-naïve patients with CHB, in terms of preventing liver-disease progression.

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Patients

PARAGRAPH

Treatment-naïve patients with CHB who started antiviral therapy with ETV 0.5 mg/day or TDF 300 mg/day (ETV and TDF groups, respectively) from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014 in 4 academic teaching hospitals (Yonsei University Severance Hospital, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Korea University Anam Hospital, and CHA Bundang Medical Center) were consecutively screened for eligibility.

Because the costs of ETV and TDF are reimbursed by the NHIS in South Korea, beginning in January 2007 and December 2012, respectively, the enrollment period was determined as above.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age ≥19 years, (2) well-preserved liver function, and (3) follow-up duration of at least 6 months.

The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) history of HCC at enrollment, (2) decompensated cirrhosis at enrollment, (3) coinfection with other hepatitis virus, (4) history of organ transplant, (5) development of clinical events (HCC, death, or OLT) within 6 months of enrollment, and (6) other significant medical illness.

Owing to the homogenous nature of our study population, data on race/ethnicity were not collected.

PARAGRAPH

In South Korea, the reimbursement criteria for ETV or TDF are identical (Table S1).

If histologic information was not available, compensated cirrhosis was clinically defined as follows: (1) platelet count <150,000/μl and ultrasonographic findings suggestive of compensated cirrhosis, including a blunted, nodular liver surface accompanied by splenomegaly (>12 cm); or (2) esophageal or gastric varices.

PARAGRAPH

The study protocol was consistent with the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each participating institution.

SECTION

Clinical evaluation, follow-up, and outcomes

PARAGRAPH

The diagnosis of hypertension was made when systolic blood pressure was ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure was ≥90 mmHg, or if the patient was taking an anti-hypertensive agent.

During follow-up, all patients underwent routine blood-chemistry testing and assay of serum HBV-DNA level and other viral markers every 3–6 months.

Patients also underwent ultrasonography and assay of serum alpha-fetoprotein level to screen for HCC and cirrhotic complications every 6 months.

PARAGRAPH

The primary outcome was HCC development.

HCC was diagnosed based on histological evidence or dynamic computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging findings (nodule >1 cm with arterial hyper-vascularity and portal/delayed-phase washout).22,23

The secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality and OLT.

The index date was the date of the first prescription of ETV or TDF and the follow-up period was between the index date and the date of HCC diagnosis, death, OLT, or the final follow-up.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Data are expressed as means ± standard deviation or numbers (%).

Differences among continuous and categorical variables were examined for significance by Student’s t test (or the Mann-Whitney U test, if appropriate) and chi-squared test (or Fisher’s exact test, if appropriate).

The cumulative risk of HCC and death or OLT was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and was compared using the log-rank test.

The multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model.

PARAGRAPH

To reduce selection bias and the effect of potential confounders, propensity scores (PSs) were calculated by logistic regression based on age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, compensated cirrhosis, and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status, total bilirubin, albumin, and platelet counts.

Differences between the 2 groups were balanced by a 1:1 PS-matched analysis and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis

PARAGRAPH

Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (ver.

9.4; SAS Institute) and R software (V.3.4.4, http://cran.r-project.org/).

Two-sided p values <0.05 were considered indicative of statistical significance.

Likewise, a similar overall pattern in the results was observed consistently (all p >0.05).

These clinical data are provided in Tables S2 and S3.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The current guidelines for the treatment of patients with CHB recommend ETV, TDF, or (if appropriate) TAF, as the first-line antiviral therapy.4,9,26

Of these, ETV and TDF have similar rates of HBV-DNA suppression and alanine aminotransferase normalization, as well as excellent safety profiles.20

However, Choi et al. 21 reported that the risk of HCC development in TDF-treated patients should be ∼35% lower than that in ETV-treated patients in an NHIS-based cohort (n = 24,156) and a tertiary hospital cohort (n = 2,701).

Given the poor prognosis of HCC, determining the treatment of choice for patients with CHB could become a scientifically, socio-economically, and ethically important matter.

We assessed this issue in an independent, large-scale, multicenter cohort study.

PARAGRAPH

In multivariate, PS-matched, and IPTW analyses, the TDF group showed comparable clinical outcomes in terms of HCC and death or OLT compared to the ETV group (all p >0.05).

These results were reproduced in the patients with compensated cirrhosis.

Our findings differ significantly from those of Choi et al. 21 in terms of the cumulative HCC risk during long-term NUC therapy.

One of the possible explanations for such a discrepancy is a preference for ETV over TDF by some hepatologists for patients with CHB and unfavorable medical characteristics, such as old age, metabolic comorbidities associated with renal disease (e.g., diabetes with or without hypertension), obesity, and smoking; these may contribute to HCC development.27

As TDF was approved ∼6 years later than ETV in South Korea, physicians were already aware of the potential safety issues associated with long-term TDF use in this population at the time of an official approval by the NHIS.28

Furthermore, we could raise several major drawbacks of the article by Choi et al.21 First of all, the frequency of regimen change in the ETV group in the hospital cohort of Choi et al.21 was 11.7%, which is somewhat high given the resistance rate of <2.0% among treatment-naïve patients and the proven safety of long-term ETV therapy.1,4,9,15,29

However, detailed reasons for the change (e.g. patient’s preference, adverse effect, resistance mutation, or partial virologic response) remain unknown.

Second, since the NHIS-based database includes age, gender, diagnosis code, and only reimbursed medications, a thorough and (if necessary) repeated review of the medical records was not feasible.

This contrasts with our multicenter cohort which can reliably yield higher resolution data in terms of medication history, baseline clinical and laboratory data, on-treatment clinical courses, and HCC surveillance.

PARAGRAPH

Our study has several strengths.

First, the large sample of almost 2,900 patients drawn from 4 independent academic teaching hospitals enhanced the reliability of the results.

Additionally, there were a sufficient number of HCC cases (n = 240, 8.3%) during the median follow-up period of 59.2 months to give adequate statistical power.30

These results were consistently reproduced when stratified by each participating hospital (all p >0.05; data not shown) and were also consistent with previous studies conducted in diverse populations in Europe, South Korea, and India.11–14,31

However, so far, only 1 study on the basis of a single-hospital cohort has reported that TDF is marginally superior to ETV for reducing the risk of HCC.21

Second, our hospital-based study provides additional data, allowing for a more thorough comparison.

For example, the difference in complete virologic response rate (defined as serum HBV-DNA <60 IU/ml) between the ETV and TDF groups at 24 months was not statistically significant (86.5% vs. 87.5%, respectively; p = 0.440), and there was no significant difference in HCC incidence between those with complete virologic response and those without (p = 0.831).

Besides, after recruiting patients who received entecavir 0.5 mg following previous exposure to lamivudine or telbivudine, we assessed their cumulative probability of HCC development and found that it was not statistically different to that in treatment-naïve patients who received entecavir 0.5 mg as a first-line antiviral agent (p = 0.094; data not shown).

In a previous study assessing the HCC risk in patients treated with lamivudine or entecavir 0.5 mg in first-line, the overall risk of HCC was similar, provided that patients received timely and appropriate rescue therapy against virologic breakthrough or resistance mutations during the periodic follow-up.32

Hence, we would like to emphasize the importance of careful monitoring in patients being treated with NUCs.

PARAGRAPH

To support their conclusions, Choi et al.21 hypothesized that ETV may have carcinogenic potential, while TDF may induce interferon (IFN)-λ3 production; however, their hypotheses are also problematic.

First, ETV has been reported to increase the incidence of lung adenomas and carcinomas, HCC, and vascular tumors in mice at 4 mg/kg, as well as increasing the incidence of HCC, brain microglial tumors, and skin fibroma in rats at 1.4–2.6 mg/kg.33

However, these dosages are at least 100-fold those used in humans.

In contrast, 2 recent large-scale real-life studies34,35 reported that long-term ETV therapy does not increase the risk of cancer.

In addition, in the long-term follow-up study by Kim et al.,36 the incidence of HCC was not statistically different during and after the first 5 years of ETV treatment (2.29% vs. 1.66%, p = 0.22).

If long-term maintenance of ETV had a significant pro-carcinogenic effect on humans, the HCC incidence would have progressed rapidly with time.

In addition, although IFN-λ3 production might be induced by long-term TDF therapy,37 conflicting data have also been reported.38–42

Because IFN-λ assays have not been standardized, neither its anti-carcinogenic effect in the human liver nor the causality of the relationship between a higher IFN-λ3 level and a lower incidence of HCC have been confirmed.

PARAGRAPH

This study also had limitations.

First, its retrospective design may introduce selection bias, particularly in terms of treatment allocation.

To overcome this, we performed various statistical adjustments as well as subgroup analyses.

Therefore, a prospective randomized study of the association between antiviral type and HCC risk is needed; however, such a study is unlikely to be conducted in the near future.

Therefore, this observational study has considerable scientific value.

Furthermore, because most (>98%) patients with CHB in South Korea become infected with genotype C HBV by vertical transmission,1,43 our results may not be generalizable to the entire HBV-infected population.

However, because the overall virologic response rates of NUCs are similar among HBV genotypes, in contrast to pegylated IFN therapy,1 our results will likely be reproduced in other countries.

Last, since the NHIS, as a single payer in South Korea, provides health insurance to more than 99% of the whole population, some overlap might exist between the NHIS database and our multicenter cohort database.

However, our study may have an advantage in that we can provide more comprehensive and reliable results than the NHIS database, where only limited data are available.

In addition, as the conclusions of several studies12,21,31 have been contradictory, it is important that the fundamental differences between the studies are determined.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, the overall prognosis in terms of development of HCC and death or OLT was not statistically different between patients treated with ETV versus TDF.

Because prevention of liver-disease progression by appropriate antiviral therapy is a very important medical and socio-economical issue, further studies are needed to validate our results.
