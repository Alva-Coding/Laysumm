TITLE

Donor outcomes in anonymous live liver donation

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Death rates on liver transplant (LT) waiting lists in the Western world range from 5-25%.1–4

This is disheartening since most LT recipients now survive for decades with good health and near normal quality of life.1,5,6

In selected locations, live liver donation (LLD) has been used to mitigate the shortage of deceased donor livers with excellent recipient outcomes.

LLD is associated with a 30% morbidity rate and an estimated 0.3% donor mortality risk.5,7–11,12

Our program and others have confirmed that donors with biological relationships or close emotional bonds with the recipient have few regrets and good outcomes.8,13

PARAGRAPH

Early in the development of our LLD program, a donor candidate challenged the requirement for a pre-existing connection between the live donor and recipient.

We acknowledged that few centers offer anonymous kidney donation but noted that the latter operation is associated with a much smaller risk.

Nonetheless, after a thorough ethical review, we decided to cautiously develop a unique program for anonymous-LLD (A-LLD) and reported favorable preliminary outcomes.13,14

Herein, we report the characteristics and surgical outcome of the larger A-LLD experience (n = 50 cases) to date.

Moreover, we provide rigorous quantitative and qualitative study data from 26/50 A-LLD who agreed to participate in a mixed methods study about their A-LLD experiences.

We explored the reasons why people volunteer to become LLD despite the significant risks; factors that facilitate this choice; how they feel about this choice afterwards; and the potential of this option to reduce deaths on LT waiting lists.

PARAGRAPH

A-LLD has the potential to alleviate suffering for those waiting for LT. In December 2016, there were 11,140 active patients waiting for a LT in the United States.

Also, in that period of time 192,947,800 individuals constituted the US population between the ages of 18 and 65.

Therefore, if approximately 1 of 17,000 US citizens in this age range volunteered to donate part of their liver, the entire waitlist could be eliminated.

We hope that the good outcomes with A-LLD reported herein will incentivize other programs to consider developing their own protocols for this option.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Study design

PARAGRAPH

A mixed methods approach was used to characterize the A-LLD experience.

This study was approved by University Health Network’s Research Ethics Board (REB #:16-5038-AE).

PARAGRAPH

We define A-LLD as a donor with no biological connection and whose identity was unknown to the recipient when starting the assessment.

A-LLD were either directed or non-directed.

Directed donors donated to a specific individual without the recipient’s knowledge.

Non-directed donors provide this gift to someone selected by the recipient team.13,15

SECTION

Participants

PARAGRAPH

From January 2005 to December 2017, we performed 2,037 adult and pediatric LTs in Toronto.

The study sample includes all patients undergoing A-LLD at the Toronto General Hospital between April 2005 and May 2017.

A detailed description of our evaluation and selection process has been reported.5,16

Briefly, all A-LLD are selected based on compliance with the Health Canada regulations for safe organ and tissue donation and transplantation.17,18

In addition to a careful medical and surgical work-up, all anonymous donor candidates between ages 16–60 are seen by both social work and psychiatry to assess their mental health, motivation, social independence, willingness to comply with our ethics policies, and support systems.

Comprehensive assessments of donor physical and mental health are performed by our team at 1 and 3 months after surgery (or longer if needed) and by the primary care provider annually for 10 years post-donation.

PARAGRAPH

Anonymous, directed donors were allocated to their intended recipients if suitability for the specific recipient was met (e.g. blood type, graft volume and anatomy).

If they were not suitable, they were offered the opportunity to donate to another recipient.

Non-directed A-LLD were given the option to donate to either a child or an adult.

We recommended donating the left lateral segment (LLS) as the first option because of the lower risks compared with donation of a full left or right lobe graft (RL),11,19–22 but respected the donor’s autonomy to make an informed decision to donate to an adult if that was their preference.

Differences in risks between the different donor procedures were explained in detail to the potential donors in order for them to be able to take an informed decision.

When an LLS hepatectomy was not possible due to either anatomical considerations or due to the absence of an available compatible recipient, RL donation was offered.

The transplant hepatology team independently selected these recipients based on priority of medical need.

Donors, besides knowing if their intended recipients were either a child or an adult, were not provided with any other additional information regarding the recipients.

PARAGRAPH

The first A-LLD operation was performed in April 2005.

Shortly thereafter we reported this case and discussed the ethical basis for A-LLD-LT.14

When evaluating A-LLD candidates, we payed particular attention to: motivation, decision-making, resilience, prior altruism, community service, and social support.

Donors were excluded if they demonstrated significant instability in psychiatric/psychosocial functioning or required intensive support to maintain stability.

Donors were reminded that Canadian law prohibits profiting in any material way from the donation.

Provincial funding provides partial reimbursement of expenses directly incurred through donation.

PARAGRAPH

In 2010, we started asking A-LLD to maintain their anonymity to be congruent with Canadian legal requirements for anonymity with deceased donation.23

Donors were informed of the immediate transplant outcome but were not informed about the recipient’s longer-term condition.

We offered to facilitate an exchange of a brief card or letter without identifying information.

We did not facilitate meetings between the donor and the recipient although a few pairs have done this through their own initiatives using social media.

SECTION

Medical, surgical, and socioeconomic data

PARAGRAPH

Medical and surgical data were extracted from our prospectively collected database.

Socioeconomic data were extracted from template social work assessments.

Mean household income, residency (defined as urban vs. rural), and cultural diversity index (defined as high, medium, or low) were approximated from postal code using Postal CodeOM Conversion File Plus, Version 6C (Statistics Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada) and PRIZM5 (Environics Analytics, Toronto, ON, Canada) and compared with normative population data.

Where relevant and when data were available, comparisons were made with normative population data or the Ontario National Household Survey Profile 2011 (Statistics Canada Catalogue no. 99-004-XWE, Ottawa, ON, Canada).

SECTION

Donor quantitative self-report data

PARAGRAPH

Of the 50 identified A-LLD, those who were at minimum 3 months post-donation (41/50) were invited to complete structured questionnaires, and 26 agreed.

From the remaining donors (15/41), 12 participants could not be reached and 3 (6%) declined participation due to lack of interest.

Post-donation medical and psychosocial follow-up was distinct from this process; while only a portion of donors agreed to participate in the study, all donors completed all of the required medical follow-up post-donation and were subsequently discharged to their primary care provider with a full case summary for ongoing care.

PARAGRAPH

Personality dimensions were explored using the big five inventory, which assesses the degrees of extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness.24

The 4-item relationship questionnaire was used to measure adult attachment styles.25

It was selected to explore potential associations between the ways in which individuals form relational attachments and the impact this has on the donation decision given some evidence that secure attachment increases compassion and altruism.24

The post-traumatic growth inventory (PTGI)26 was administered to examine positive changes donors might have experienced.

The PTGI was administered with a preamble explaining that donors have described LLD as a positive but unexpectedly difficult experience in order to clarify the original instructions in which the event in question is referred to as a “crisis/disaster.”

SECTION

Donor qualitative data

PARAGRAPH

Everyone who completed the structured questionnaires participated in semi-structured qualitative interviews.

Transcripts were independently coded during data collection to identify emerging themes, often by identifying unique terms used by the participants themselves (e.g. “Life-changing”).27

During the interview process, the investigators met as a group to reach consensus on key codes and themes directly related to the project objectives and recurring across multiple interviews.28

To confirm importance and identify associations, transcripts were critically re-analyzed using the constant comparison method.28

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Data are shown as median (range) or number (percentage) unless otherwise stated.

Data were analyzed for significance using SPSS 22 statistical package (IBM, Chicago, USA).

A p value of <0.05 was considered significant.

SECTION

Results

SECTION

A-LLD characteristics

PARAGRAPH

In the study period, 743 LLD were performed at our institution.

Fifty (6.7%) were performed anonymously.

The annual rates of anonymous donation have been stable for the past 5 years.

Self-reported questionnaires were received from 26 (63%) patients out of the 41 A-LLD who were more than 3 months post-donation.

All respondents also volunteered to participate in a qualitative interview.

PARAGRAPH

Donor characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

Fifteen (30%) A-LLD were directed, having learned of the specific recipient’s need through media appeals and community news.

Over half of donations (n = 28, 56%) went to a pediatric recipient while the remainder (n = 22, 44%) went to adult recipients.

PARAGRAPH

Twenty-six (52%) were women and 24 (48%) men.

Median age was 38.5 years (range 20–59).

Most were Caucasian (n = 47, 94%).

Many were married or in a common-law relationship (54%) and many had children (40%).

Fig. 1 depicts their socioeconomic status compared with Ontario normative populations.

SECTION

How donors learned about living liver donation as an option

PARAGRAPH

More than two-thirds of donors (n = 33, 70%) came forward after learning about the growing need for organ donation through media appeals on behalf of patients on the transplant waiting list in local, national or social media.

Only 8 donors knew somebody who has been a solid organ transplant recipient.

Twenty-seven patients found out through the media about the organ shortage, a patient in need of a LT or stories about previous live donors; 6 patients found out through their community involvement (e.g. place of work, church/temple, etc.) about somebody in need of a LT; 6 donors knew somebody in need of a LT but upon finding they would not be a suitable match, opted for non-directed donation; 5 donors directed to someone with whom they had an existing relationship but wished to remain anonymous; 3 had a family member who benefited from LT and wanted to reciprocate; 1 was previously a bone marrow donor and felt that he wanted to do more; 1 had a relative die while waiting for a LT; 1 donor was a healthcare professional who had witnessed many patients affected by the need for transplant.

SECTION

History of altruism

PARAGRAPH

The majority of donors (n = 34, 68%) had a history of altruistic acts prior to liver donation.

This included volunteer work in their local community and/or with international charity organizations (n = 23, 46%), regular or ad hoc blood donation (n = 20, 40%), and solid organ donation (n = 3, 6%).

Two of the donors had a prior history of anonymous living kidney donation.

One donor underwent bone marrow donation prior to liver donation.

Median evaluation time for all donors was 94 (18–681) days.

SECTION

Response to public/media appeals

PARAGRAPH

The flow of donor applications and their outcomes during the study interval is shown in Fig. 2.

During the study interval, in addition to the completed donations described, there were another 637 anonymous donor candidate applications received.

From them, 536 (84%) candidates submitted as directed donors in response to media appeals of various scales or advocacy on behalf of recipients by family members.

The remaining 101 (16%) submitted as non-directed donors.

Of the directed donor group, 509 (95%) donor files were closed after the intended recipient received a transplant and before the formal donor work-up was initiated.

Upon notification of their file closure, 27 (5%) candidates indicated they wished to be considered as non-directed donors in response to a missed opportunity to donate to the individual for whom they responded initially.

Of the combined non-directed group of 128 donors, 74 (58%) were rejected after reviewing the screening questionnaire, most commonly due to a body mass index higher than the upper maximum of 35 kg/m2 or health-related contraindications.

The remaining 54 (42%) non-directed donors were rejected at various stages after starting a work-up due to medical or anatomical unsuitability.

SECTION

Donor surgical outcomes

PARAGRAPH

Donor surgical outcomes are summarized in Table 2.

Thirteen donors (26%) experienced a complication (Table 3).

Only 1 major complication (Dindo-Clavien ≥3b) occurred.

This donor required re-operation to evacuate a hematoma.

PARAGRAPH

Median hospital stay was 6 (4–11) days.

Median time to return to work was 12 weeks (3–24 weeks).

One donor with a deep vein thrombosis has persistent leg edema that limits vigorous physical activity.

SECTION

Personality traits

PARAGRAPH

When compared with the general population.

A-LLDs had higher scores on the big five inventory22 in agreeableness (mean = 4.24, SE = 0.11, p <0.0001) and conscientiousness (mean = 4.28, SE = 0.09, p <0.0001); and lower scores on neuroticism (mean = 2.27, SE = 0.15, p <0.0001).

SECTION

Attachment style

PARAGRAPH

Close to half of the respondents (13 donors, 50%) identified with secure attachment (Table 4).

A third of respondents (8 donors) identified with a dismissing attachment style.

Four (15%) respondents reported having a fearful attachment style.

SECTION

Perspectives on anonymity

PARAGRAPH

Forty-four donors (88%) maintained anonymity.

The remaining 6 donors (12%) met their recipients or their families, personally or in an indirect manner through electronic media.

One of the donors experienced mild distress related to the recipient family pursuing more contact than they were comfortable with, which resolved with counseling.

Three donors who disclosed to their recipient were interviewed.

During those interviews, donors noted that it was gratifying to see the result of their donation and reported that they do not regret the disclosure.

SECTION

Psychological growth subsequent to A-LLD

PARAGRAPH

Fig. 3 summarizes self-reported post-traumatic growth.

Significant growth was reported in the “relating to others” subscale (mean = 10.33, SD = 7.2); of these, “I more clearly see that I can count on people in times of trouble,” and “I learned a great deal about how wonderful people are,” were most strongly identified as areas of change with endorsement at a moderate score of ≥3 by 41% and 44% of respondents respectively.

SECTION

The themes arising from the qualitative interviews

PARAGRAPH

Major themes that emerged during the qualitative interviews are summarized in Table 5.

Data saturation was achieved when using grounded theory for this analysis.

Information from the final interviews did not yield new concepts and the relationships between the categories were clear.

The concept of a good deed, a random act of kindness that would contribute to helping someone in need without the expectation of reciprocity or repayment, was identified as a core motivator.

As healthy individuals, the moral obligation to help someone in need was frequently mentioned as a major factor and a moral imperative in decision-making to donate.

Many reported an emotional reaction to an appeal from a potential recipient in the news or social media, in some cases making associations with their personal histories or relationships.

Most believed that anonymity helped to preserve the value of doing a good deed.

PARAGRAPH

Finances and practical arrangements for work or family matters were reported as challenging factors in the donation process.

Universal healthcare and generous employment benefits were facilitators.

Most donors reported increased confidence in their ability to cope with problems and connect with others as a result of overcoming these challenges.

PARAGRAPH

Validation in the health and strength of their own bodies were frequently reported in statements about impact post-donation.

Donors were grateful that they were sufficiently fit to donate and reported feeling empowered by the process of recovering their health.

No A-LLD expressed regret.

SECTION

Transplant outcomes

PARAGRAPH

Table S1 summarizes the recipients’ characteristics (e.g. age, gender).

The main indication for LT in the pediatric population was biliary atresia (39%), followed by a metabolic disease (32%).

In the adult population, the main indication for LT included primary sclerosing cholangitis (23%), hepatitis C (18%), and alcoholic cirrhosis (18%).

PARAGRAPH

Graft and patient survival for the pediatric population at 1-, 3- and 5-years was of 97%.

Graft and patient survival for the adult population at 1-, 3- and 5-years was 91%/86%/81% and 91%/86%/86%, respectively.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

We performed our first A-LLD in 2005.14

Motivated by improvement in a friend’s quality of life after solid organ transplantation, a 45-year-old man stepped forward offering to donate the LLS of his liver to any suitable child.

He challenged our initial practice of restricting donation to those with a direct biological or strong emotional connection with the recipient by asserting 1) he was entitled to make well-informed autonomous decisions about undertaking voluntary health risks; and 2) we should seize this opportunity because saving lives is the most important human and healthcare system value.13

PARAGRAPH

Why do people volunteer to donate part of their liver to a stranger?

The qualitative interviews reveal a perceived moral duty to step forward given good health and the great need.

Public appeals are credited with raising awareness of the opportunity to save a life by these means.

Some personalize the experience of the unknown recipient, stating that they hope that someone else would do this for them should they ever become ill with liver failure.

Giving back in acknowledgement of a privileged life is another prevalent motivation.

Some identify a desire for reciprocity recalling a specific event or time in their life when others helped them.

Finally, many note that anonymous donation is a more accurate term than altruistic donation since the donor also benefits from a thorough work-up and the satisfaction of helping others in an extraordinary way.

PARAGRAPH

A-LLD were predominantly Caucasian, well-educated, financially secure, socially-supported urban residents from many different walks of life.

Their stable personal circumstances and gainful employment facilitated decisions to donate anonymously.

Thirty-five (70%) had a history of prior altruistic acts before becoming an LLD.

We elected to move forward with the 30% who did not have a history of prior altruistic acts based on their clinical presentation and our careful social work and psychiatry evaluations.

PARAGRAPH

Whether it is reasonable for a single individual to undergo 2 living donations raised safety and ethical questions for the program; several cases were approved following a detailed assessment in compliance with standards under the Canadian Standards Association Cells, Tissues and Organs for Transplantation: General Requirements.17,18

Four donors either were or subsequently became live kidney donors.

An additional 3 donors have completed kidney donation assessments and are currently awaiting recipient matching, while one has anonymously donated bone marrow.

PARAGRAPH

Seventy percent of the A-LLD became aware of the opportunity to donate through social and public media appeals.

This group fell into 3 broad categories: a) those who donated directly to the intended recipient, b) those who responded to an appeal for an individual but donated to someone else after a missed opportunity, and c) those who stepped forward without a specific recipient in mind after learning of LLD through media or their community.

Information about the liver’s ability to regenerate itself to restore normal function and the lack of alternative treatment options for liver failure were frequently cited as an important reason to opt for liver donation instead of kidney donation.

Concerns about fairness, privacy and risk of donor and recipient exploitation have been raised with respect to public solicitation of living organ donation.

We have tried to address these issues by strictly adhering to transparent medical, legal, and ethical policies guiding directed live donation.31

PARAGRAPH

Those who knew the identity of their recipient reported a heightened level of distress during and after donation about protecting their identity.

This group focused on the fact that disclosure of their identity may bring unwanted attention and create unrealistic expectations of their character.

Moreover, donors in this group worried about their own expectations of the recipient, expressing that knowing too much about the recipient or establishing a relationship with them might be an unfulfilling experience or change their impression of the experience.

This group reported that they felt protected by the anonymity policy with which they were prepared during the assessment process.

PARAGRAPH

Bioethics, clinicians, regulatory groups and other content experts were consulted in formulating our policies around anonymity and disclosure.

Given reported concerns from donors and the potential detrimental impact to both donors and recipients in the case of a negative outcome, the program completely anonymizes the process of A-LLD and does not engage in donor-recipient disclosure.

PARAGRAPH

Structured questionnaires revealed personality traits that facilitated calculated risk-taking to help others.

Donors identified themselves as agreeable, conscientious, orderly and responsible with low neuroticism.

These traits are consistent with literature showing that securely attached individuals find comfort in reciprocity and close relationships with others, exhibit greater compassion, have a greater willingness to help others in distress or need, and have fewer egoistic motives.24,29

While a fearful-avoidant attachment style is inversely related to the helping behavior, engagement may be associated with a more egoistic motive (e.g. a sense of belonging, the satisfaction of a good deed).

While such individuals also tend to experience challenges with seeking assistance and depending on others, individuals in this cohort nevertheless had a positive outcome with appropriate screening and support.

The present analysis suggests that these collective personality traits are also associated with a low risk of experiencing regret or poor quality of life following LLD.30

PARAGRAPH

Donor and recipient physical outcomes in the anonymous cohort were similar to the outcomes reported for directed donation to individuals with whom the donor has a biological or close emotional relationship.5,9

Overall and major complication rates were 26% and 2%, respectively.

A-LLD acknowledged that this experience was not easy but believed that they also benefited by gaining insight into their personal strength and the value of key relationships.

PARAGRAPH

This study has limitations and strengths.

Biases or confounding factors may have been introduced by mixing retrospective and contemporaneous data collection.

There is an opportunity to compare non-A-LLDs as a control group, an analysis which is currently underway.

As with all surveys, we do not know the views of the non-respondents and this report may exclude understanding of poorer outcomes or experiences.

However, the response rate of 51% is consistent with other qualitative research studies and data saturation was achieved when using grounded theory for the qualitative analysis.

Our consistent protocol-driven processes for donor evaluation, donor acceptance, surgery, and post-operative follow-up are other strengths.

PARAGRAPH

We have previously reported our perspectives on the ethical foundation for A-LLD, proposing that decisions about candidates should be based on the ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and informed consent.14

Programs providing A-LLD face many challenging questions with no clear answers.

For example, is it ethical to expose good Samaritans to surgical morbidity and even a risk of dying when there are options to expand the use of deceased donor organs by treating with machine perfusion?

Is it reasonable to let someone decide if they are willing to accept a slightly higher surgical mortality risk to donate a larger portion of their liver to an adult rather than a smaller portion of their liver to a child?

Is it ethical to offer donation of a liver when someone has already donated a kidney and has slightly reduced renal function?

Currently, Canadian regulations on living organ and tissue donor suitability assessment are limited to specific exclusionary criteria pertaining to behavioral risks of infection (Table S2).

These standards are important for minimizing potential health risks to the recipient.

Regulations currently provide guidance on a physical exam of the living donor in broad strokes, but the outcome remains dependent on the expertise, decision and confidence of the medical providers.

However, the decision of suitability beyond infection risk must take into consideration the nuances of donor history, psychosocial characteristics and a thorough review of the clinical assessment in its entirety.

To ensure sound ethical decision-making and mitigation of safety risks as much as possible, our program has developed a donor-centric, expertise-based multidisciplinary approach.

For example, when considering suitability of sequential liver and kidney donors, we consult specialists from both kidney and LT teams, as well as independent medical consultants.

A collaborative decision is made that complies with national regulations as well as expert opinion on overall clinical risk.

Teams offering A-LLD are therefore, moral agents in this process and must carefully weigh the individual benefits and risks for each candidate.

National regulatory bodies recognize that in order to optimize national programs and standards, a more coordinated model towards clinical governance is needed and programs are recommended to collaborate by standardizing operating procedures that consider both recipient risks as well as donor safety.

We continue to use our experiences to contribute to this effort.

PARAGRAPH

When discussing this experience, we were frequently asked: Can this experience be replicated elsewhere?

It is up to others to answer this question, but we acknowledge many advantages that facilitate caring for these courageous volunteers.

First, Canada’s publicly funded universal healthcare system eliminates the financial burdens that might otherwise be associated with donor assessment, surgery, and long-term care.

Second, our legal system supports LLD through employee-friendly workplace regulations and reasonably generous social supports for those who become ill or disabled.30

Third, the Ontario government has reduced financial barriers by reimbursing most of the donor’s direct costs of LLD, including travel and accommodation expenses, a program for which all Ontario donors universally quality (PRELOD, Trillium Gift of Life).

Fourth, Canadian culture supports live organ donation by valuing civic freedoms, compliance with laws, contributing to community, fairness, and a polite comfort with individual choice.31,32

Reflecting these values and prevailing public views, Canadian media reports about altruistic donation have been generally positive.

Lastly, our assessment process is focused on facilitating the generous intent of donor candidates without compromising safety.

PARAGRAPH

A-LLD not only saves the life of the transplanted recipient, it also reduces the demand on the deceased donor waiting list.

A-LLD is particularly valuable for pediatric recipients because it provides healthy, high quality grafts and reduces the risk of recipients deteriorating on the waiting list.

Access to this option helped to reduce our pediatric wait list by 38% between the years 2014–2017 when A-LLD rates temporarily spiked due to multiple high-profile media solicitations.

PARAGRAPH

A-LLD comprises an overall small percentage of our LT activity.

During the study period, 2.45% (50/2037) of our overall LT activity and 6.73% (50/743) of our LLD activity was done through A-LLD.

However, this option is a small but important part of a multifaceted effort at our center to reduce deaths on our LT waiting list, complimenting other measures such as transplanting extended criteria deceased donor grafts with and without machine perfusion storage.
