TITLE

Th17 cell frequency is associated with low bone mass in primary sclerosing cholangitis

PARAGRAPH

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a cholestatic liver disease characterized by progressive bile duct destruction.

One serious complication of PSC is reduced bone mass resulting in increased fracture risk.

Herein, we demonstrate that Th17 cells mediate bone loss in PSC by inducing bone resorption, which suggests that antibody-based IL-17 blockade might be beneficial for the treatment of bone loss in affected patients.
