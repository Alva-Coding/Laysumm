TITLE

MUC13 promotes intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma progression via EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathways

SECTION

INTRODUCTION

PARAGRAPH

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is the second most common liver cancer after hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

It accounts for 5–10% of all primary liver malignancies.1

Epidemiological data indicate marked increases in iCCA incidence and mortality during the last decade.2

Conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy have not been effective at improving long-term survival.

Therefore, the curative treatment for iCCA is limited to surgical resection.3

However, iCCA is always diagnosed at an advanced stage.

Consequently, the efficacy of curative surgery is very limited.

For this reason, the molecular mechanisms underlying iCCA must be explored in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies.

PARAGRAPH

The gene encoding the recently identified transmembrane protein Mucin 13 (MUC13) is localized on chromosome band 3q13.3.4

MUC13 has a tandem repeat (TR) domain characteristic of all mucins which provides a scaffold for building oligosaccharide structures.

MUC13 also contains three epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains and a cytoplasmic domain which may participate in cell signaling.4

MUC13 is aberrantly expressed in ovarian, pancreatic, gastric, renal, and colon cancers.5-9

Its overexpression promotes malignant growth and metastasis by upregulating/activating the key oncogenes HER2, PAK1, ERK, AKT, and S100A4.

It downregulates the P53 tumor suppressor in ovarian and pancreatic cancers.6,7

McGuckin et al. reported that MUC13 activates the NF-κB signaling pathway and its downstream targets in colorectal and renal cancer cells.10,11

However, the expression profile of MUC13 and its role in the progression of iCCA are unknown.

Therefore, in this study, we sought to determine the expression and clinical significance, functional effects, and modes of action of MUC13 in iCCA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

SECTION

Patients and tissue samples

PARAGRAPH

A retrospective cohort of 60 iCCA patients who had undergone routine surgical procedures at the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China, was included in the present study.

Ethical approval was obtained from the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University Research Ethics Committee, and informed consent was obtained from each patient.

Inclusion criteria were: primary diagnosis of iCCA between 2005 and 2014 (at least 5 years of potential follow-up); no previous diagnosis of carcinoma; and no evidence of disease within 1 month of primary surgery.

Patients who received neoadjuvant treatment before primary surgery were excluded.

All patients were examined routinely every 3–6 months during the first 5 years of follow-up and once a year thereafter.

The median follow-up period of surviving patients (n = 60) was 39 months.

Overall survival time was defined to be the period of time in months from operation to death.

Disease-free survival time was defined as the period of time in months from operation to the date at which relapse was clinically identified.

PARAGRAPH

Sixty iCCA and adjacent non-tumor tissue samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 24 h, dehydrated in 70% ethanol, and embedded in paraffin.

Twenty-nine iCCA and adjacent non-tumor specimens were obtained at the time of surgery, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80°C.

The pathological diagnosis of iCCA was performed according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria.12

Grades of differentiation were evaluated using the classification proposed by Edmondson and Steiner.

Clinicopathological patient information was obtained from patient records and is provided in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.

Use of all samples was approved by the Committee for Ethical Review of Research at the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.

Statistical methods

PARAGRAPH

Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism v. 7 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) or with SPSS v. 16.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

Data are expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD).

ANOVA, Student’s t-test and Wilcoxon test were used to evaluate statistical significance.

Overall survival (OS) was compared by the Kaplan–Meier method, and significance was determined by a log-rank test.

Associations between MUC13 expression and various clinicopathological characteristics were assessed by χ2-tests.

Correlations between MUC13 expression and p-AKT or miR-212-3p levels in tumor tissues were examined using Spearman or Pearson correlation analyses.

Cox’s proportional hazards regression model was used to identify independent prognostic factors.

Results with P-values (P) < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS

SECTION

MUC13 is upregulated in human iCCA and correlated with worse clinical outcomes

PARAGRAPH

Results from RT-PCR showed that MUC13 was significantly upregulated in tumor tissues relative to levels in the corresponding adjacent non-tumor tissues (Figure 1A).

Similar results were obtained by western blot for 16 paired human iCCA samples (Figure 1B).

Results from IHC showed that the staining score of the MUC13 protein in the iCCA tissues was higher than that in the adjacent non-tumor tissues (Figure 1C).

We then investigated eight paired independent iCCA samples and found that the MUC13 protein and mRNA levels in those presenting with lymph node metastasis were higher than in those without it (Figure 1D).

MUC13 protein and mRNA levels were higher in the indicated iCCA cell lines than the normal bile duct cell line (Figure 1E and Supplementary Figure 1).

Basal MUC13 levels were correlated with iCCA cell invasiveness (Supplementary Figure 2).

We investigated the relationship between MUC13 expression and patient clinicopathological features.

According to the IHC results, 60 patients with iCCA were divided into high-expression and low-expression groups.

A correlation analysis of MUC13 protein levels with clinicopathologic features revealed a significant association between MUC13 upregulation and vascular invasion or lymph node metastasis (Supplementary Table 2).

Multivariate analysis showed that MUC13 expression was an independent prognostic factor.

With regard to other clinicopathological characteristics, only vascular invasion and lymph node metastasis had significant prognostic influences on overall survival (Supplementary Table 3).

Patients with high MUC13 expression had shorter overall- and disease-free survival than those with low MUC13 expression (Figure 1F).

SECTION

MUC13 promotes proliferation and growth of iCCA in vitro and in vivo

PARAGRAPH

To determine the impact of MUC13, we generated three lenti-shRNA to silence endogenous MUC13 expression in the MUC13high cell lines HuCCT1 and HCCC9810.

MUC13 was strongly downregulated by lenti-shRNA3 (KD-3) and moderately downregulated by KD-1 and KD-2 relative to the control shRNA (Supplementary Figure 3A).

Therefore, KD-3 was chosen for further experiments.

We also infected the MUC13low cell lines Huh28 and CCLP1 with plasmids expressing MUC13 (Supplementary Figure 3B).

The growth curve assay revealed that MUC13 knockdown significantly inhibited HuCCT1 and HCCC9810 proliferation relative to the control by the fifth day.

Conversely, MUC13 overexpression significantly promoted Huh28 and CCLP1 proliferation by day five (Figure 2A).

These results were further confirmed by CFSE assay (Supplementary Figure 4).

Colony formation assay showed that MUC13 downregulation resulted in fewer colonies than the control.

In contrast, MUC13 upregulation increased the number of colonies relative to the control (Figure 2B).

Xenograft models were also created by subcutaneously injecting iCCA cells into the flanks of nude mice.

Tumor volumes and weights were lower in the MUC13 knockdown group than the control group.

Conversely, when MUC13 was overexpressed, tumor volume and weight were significantly increased compared to those in the control (Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure 5A).

IHC indicated that Ki-67 was significantly decreased in MUC13-knockdown xenograft tumors, but increased in MUC13-overexpressing xenograft tumors, relative to the controls (Supplementary Figure 5B).

An iCCA animal model was established by stably co-expressing an activated form of human AKT1 (myr-AKT1) and a non-phosphorylatable form of Yap (YapS127A) following hydrodynamic injection.

To knockout MUC13 in vivo, we constructed a pX330 vector co-expressing an sg RNA targeting MUC13 and Cas9.

Results showed that CRISPR-mediated MUC13 knockout significantly attenuated tumor burden, as indicated by liver weight (Figure 2D).

SECTION

MUC13 promotes iCCA migration, invasion, and lung metastasis

PARAGRAPH

Wound healing assays showed that MUC13 knockdown reduced HuCCT1 and HCCC9810 migration whereas MUC13 overexpression accelerated Huh28 and CCLP1 migration (Figure 3A).

Matrigel-uncoated (migration) and -coated (invasion) Transwell assays showed that MUC13 downregulation in HuCCT1 and HCCC9810 significantly reduced cell migration and invasion whereas MUC13 upregulation in Huh28 and CCLP1 enhanced cell migration (Supplementary Figure 6A) and invasion (Figure 3B).

PARAGRAPH

We evaluated the role of MUC13 in tumor metastasis by injecting iCCA cells into nude mice via their tail veins and monitoring lung metastatic nodules.

MUC13 repression decreased the incidence of lung metastasis and the number of metastatic nodules whereas MUC13 induction increased them (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure 7).

The peritoneal cavity and liver metastasis models showed that MUC13 knockdown reduced the number of metastatic nodules while MUC13 overexpression increased it (Supplementary Figures 6B and 6C).

In addition, an in situ intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma model was established to evaluate tumor metastasis.

Although the difference was small, silencing of MUC13 in HuCCT1 cells reduced metastasis to the lungs.

Importantly, we found that MUC13-transfected CCLP1 cells were more likely to metastasize to the lungs than control cells (Supplementary Figure 6D).

SECTION

MUC13 facilitates iCCA metastasis by activating the AKT/TIMP1/MMP9 signaling pathway

PARAGRAPH

Since MUC13 substantially influenced iCCA cell metastasis, the signaling pathways involved in tumor metastasis were investigated using western blot to evaluate the expression levels of phosphorylated AKT, STAT3, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK).

MUC13 knockdown decreased AKT and ERK phosphorylation but had minimal impact on the other proteins.

In contrast, MUC13 overexpression increased AKT and ERK phosphorylation (Figure 4A).

We then determined whether the AKT or ERK signaling pathway is required for MUC13-mediated iCCA metastasis.

The specific inhibition of AKT activity by MK2206 markedly impeded migration and invasion by MUC13-overexpressing Huh28 and CCLP1 cells (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure 8A).

It also hindered the metastasis of nodules in mice bearing MUC13-overexpressing CCLP1 cells (Figure 4B).

To eliminate possible non-target effects of AKT inhibitors, siRNA-mediated AKT-silencing experiments were performed.

AKT knockdown inhibited migration and invasion of MUC13-overexpressing Huh28 and CCLP1 cells (Supplementary Figures 8B and 9).

Ectopic expression of active myr-AKT plasmid significantly restored migration and invasion after MUC13 silencing (Supplementary Figure 8C).

However, the MEK1/ERK inhibitors PD98059 and U1026 had no effect on cell motility (Supplementary Figures 10A and 10B).

PARAGRAPH

We then determined whether MUC13 modulates MMPs or epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT).

MMPs are key downstream metastasis-related AKT signaling pathway effectors.13

MUC13 inhibition significantly downregulated MMP9 and upregulated metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1) tissue inhibitors but had minimal effect on MMP2, MMP7, or TIMP2.

Conversely, MUC13 overexpression upregulated MMP9 and downregulated the metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1) tissue inhibitor (Figure 4C).

We found that MUC13 had no significant effect on the expression of EMT-related genes, such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin (Supplementary Figure 11A).

MK2206 administration repressed MMP9 and prevented TIMP1 downregulation in MUC13-overexpressing cells (Figure 4D and Supplementary Figure 11B).

PARAGRAPH

We then assessed whether the combination of MUC13 and p-AKT could accord this benefit.

We investigated the association between MUC13 and p-AKT expression in iCCA.

MUC13 and p-AKT expression were positively correlated in iCCA tissues (Figure 4E).

Moreover, patients presenting with MUC13 and p-AKT co-expression had comparatively poorer prognoses (Figure 4F).

SECTION

EGFR is indispensable for MUC13-enhanced PI3K-AKT activation and metastasis in iCCA

PARAGRAPH

PI3K enhances AKT activation while tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) suppress it.

Western blot showed that PTEN expression was independent of MUC13 expression level (Supplementary Figure 12A).

Kinase activity assays showed that MUC13 significantly augmented the phosphorylation of PI3K (P85) and PI3K activity in iCCA cells (Supplementary Figures 12B and 12C).

Inhibition of PI3K activity by LY294002 effectively blocked the migration and invasion of MUC13-overexpressing Huh28 and CCLP1 cells (Supplementary Figure 12D) and suppressed the metastasis of nodules in mice bearing MUC13-overexpressing CCLP1 cells (Supplementary Figure 12E).

LY294002 repressed MMP9 and p-AKT and prevented TIMP1 downregulation in MUC13-overexpressing cells (Supplementary Figures 12F).

To eliminate possible non-target effects of PI3K inhibitors, siRNA-mediated PI3K(P85)-silencing experiments were performed.

PI3K(P85) knockdown inhibited the migration of MUC13-overexpressing Huh28 and CCLP1 cells (Supplementary Figures 13A-13C).

Moreover, PI3K(P85) knockdown repressed MMP9 and p-AKT and prevented TIMP1 downregulation in MUC13-overexpressing cells (Supplementary Figure 13D).

PARAGRAPH

The mitogens EGF and HGF were used to determine whether receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are required for MUC13-mediated PI3K-AKT activation.

As shown in Figure 5A, MUC13 overexpression robustly enhanced AKT activation upon EGF stimulation.

In contrast, MUC13 knockdown markedly suppressed AKT activation.

However, no such changes were observed in response to HGF stimulation (Supplementary Figures 14A and 14B).

After EGF stimulation, EGFR phosphorylation levels significantly increased in response to MUC13 overexpression but were effectively reduced in MUC13 knockdown cells.

This pattern resembled that observed for p-AKT (Figure 5B).

Treatment with the EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 abrogated the effects of MUC13 on EGFR and AKT phosphorylation in response to EGF stimulation (Figure 5C).

Similar results were also obtained for MUC13-overexpressing or MUC13-repressed cells and their control counterparts even without EGF stimulation (Figure 5D).

AG1478 substantially hindered migration and invasion in MUC13-overexpressing CCLP1 cells (Figure 5E and Supplementary 15A) and suppressed nodule metastasis in mice bearing MUC13-overexpressing CCLP1 cells (Figure 5F).

To eliminate possible non-target effects of AG1478, siRNA-mediated EGFR-silencing experiments were performed.

EGFR knockdown inhibited the migration of MUC13-overexpressing CCLP1 cells (Supplementary Figures 15B and 15C).

EGFR knockdown also abrogated the effects of MUC13 on EGFR and AKT phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure 15D).

SECTION

MUC13 physically interacts with EGFR, promotes EGFR dimerization, and prevents EGFR internalization

PARAGRAPH

Previous studies reported that MUC1, MUC4, and MUC15 interact with RTKs.13-15.

We performed co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) experiments to determine whether MUC13 and EGFR physically interact.

Reciprocal CoIP assays indicated that EGFR and exogenous or endogenous MUC13 interact (Figure 6A).

Immunofluorescence staining revealed membrane colocalization of MUC13 with EGFR (Figure 6B).

To establish how MUC13 controls EGFR activation, we assessed whether MUC13 regulates EGFR internalization kinetics via a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of EGFR levels at the surfaces of control- and EGF-stimulated cells.

After EGF stimulation, MUC13-overexpressing cells internalized EGFR more slowly than control cells.

In contrast, MUC13-depleted cells presented with the opposite effect (Figure 6C).

We next investigated whether MUC13 regulates EGFR dimerization.

Crosslinking experiments showed that MUC13 induction increased EGF-induced EGFR dimerization, whereas MUC13 silencing had the opposite effect (Figure 6D).

SECTION

MUC13 is a direct target of miR-212-3p in iCCA

PARAGRAPH

To investigate the upstream regulatory mechanism of MUC13 in iCCA, we searched the TargetScan database, identified candidate miRNAs miR-132-3p and miR-212-3p, and measured them in human iCCA samples.

Only miR-212-3p was downregulated in human iCCA samples (Figure 7A and Supplementary Figure 16).

RT-PCR and western blot revealed that MUC13 was repressed in miR-212-3p-expressing cells whereas miR-212-3p inhibition upregulated MUC13 (Figure 7B and Supplementary Figure 17).

To confirm binding between miR-212-3p and the MUC13 3'-UTR, we performed a luciferase reporter assay with a wild type or mutated MUC13 3'-UTR-coupled luciferase reporter (Figure 7C).

Luciferase activity was suppressed by miR-212-3p in HuCCT1 cells transfected with wild type MUC13-3' UTR whereas miR-212-3p inhibition enhanced luciferase reporter activity in CCLP1 transfected with wild type MUC13-3'UTR (Figure 7D).

Mutation of the 3'UTR sequence of MUC13 reversed miR-212-3p suppression (Figure 7D).

MUC13 and miR-212-3p expression levels were negatively correlated in iCCA samples (Figure 7E).

Overall patient survival tended to increase with miR-212-3p expression level (Figure 7F).

SECTION

MiR-212-3p inhibits iCCA metastasis by targeting MUC13

PARAGRAPH

We investigated whether miR-212-3p affects iCCA metastasis by regulating MUC13 expression.

Matrigel-uncoated- (migration) and coated (invasion) Transwell assays showed that miR-212-3p overexpression significantly reduced HuCCT1 cell migration and invasion whereas MUC13 upregulation enhanced them (Figure 8A and Supplementary Figure 18A).

Conversely, MiR-212-3p inhibition increased CCLP1 cell migration and invasion but MUC13 repression restored them (Figure 8B and Supplementary Figure 18B).

To determine whether these results were reproducible in metastasis in vivo, luciferase-expressing HuCCT1 cells were injected into the tail veins of nude mice.

Lung tumor metastasis was significantly decreased by MiR-212-3p overexpression and significantly recovered by MUC13 upregulation (Figure 8C).

Western blot showed that miR-212-3p overexpression inhibited MUC13, p-EGFR (Y1068), p-AKT, and MMP9 and stimulated TIMP1 in HuCCT1 cells.

In contrast, miR-212-3p inhibition upregulated MUC13, p-EGFR (Y1068), p-AKT, and MMP9 and downregulated TIMP1 in CCLP1 cells (Figure 8D).

Upon EGF stimulation, miR-212-3p overexpression suppressed EGFR and AKT activation while miR-212-3p inhibition enhanced them (Figure 8E).

SECTION

Aberrant CpG hypermethylation downregulates miR-212-3p in iCCA

PARAGRAPH

Previous studies showed that miRNA expression in malignant tumors may be regulated by epigenetic silencing via DNA methylation or histone modification.16

We treated HuCCT1 cells with either the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) or the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA).

The 5-aza-dC increased miR-212-3p mRNA expression in HuCCT1 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure 19A).

In contrast, TSA treatment did not affect miR-212-3p expression (Supplementary Figure 19B).

We explored the DNA methylation status of a CpG island encompassing the proximal miR-212-3p promoter in 13 paired iCCA samples using real-time methylation-specific PCR (MSP) (101).

The miR-212-3p promoter area was hypermethylated in iCCA samples relative to the control (Supplementary Figure 19C).

DNA methylation levels in the miR-212-3p-promoter region were strongly negatively correlated with miR-212-3p levels in iCCA samples (Supplementary Figure 19D).

SECTION

DISCUSSION

PARAGRAPH

Secreted and transmembrane mucins are high-molecular-weight glycoproteins.

They are often heavily O-glycosylated in the cytoplasm or the membrane.

MUC2, MUC4, MUC6, and MUC7 are overexpressed in iCCA.17,18

MUC1 and MUC4 may serve as biomarkers for early iCCA detection and prognosis.19,20

Knockdown of MUC1 inhibits proliferation of iCCA by downregulating hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1).21

However, the function of MUC13 in iCCA is unclear.

In the present study, we explored the biological and clinical significance and underlying mechanism of MUC13 in iCCA.

PARAGRAPH

MUC13 is overexpressed in various malignant tumors and participates in tumorigenesis and metastasis.22

Consistent with previous research, we demonstrated that MUC13 was overexpressed in iCCA tissues and cell lines.

Our results demonstrated that patients with iCCA that exhibited high MUC13 expression levels had worse prognoses than those with low MUC13 expression levels.

Our loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments revealed that MUC13 knockdown attenuated and MUC13 overexpression accentuated iCCA proliferation, motility, and invasiveness in vitro and in vivo.

Therefore, MUC13 is a candidate oncogene for iCCA risk prognostication and therapy.

PARAGRAPH

The PI3K-AKT signaling pathway is involved in metastasis and is activated in various cancers including iCCA.23,24

Our results showed that AKT signaling pathway activation and its downstream effects were required for MUC13-mediated iCCA metastasis.

Although MUC13 increased the expression of p-ERK, activation of ERK was not necessary for MUC13-mediated iCCA metastasis.

We also found that MUC13 increased PI3K activity but had minimal impact on PTEN expression.

Recovery experiments confirmed that PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activation contributes to the oncogenic effects of MUC13 in iCCA cells.

We observed a positive correlation between MUC13 and p-AKT in iCCA specimens.

Therefore, the combination of MUC13 and p-AKT had a greater prognostic value than either factor alone.

MUC13 promotes iCCA metastasis, at least in part, by activating the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.

PARAGRAPH

Unrestrained epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling activation is common to many malignant tumors including iCCA.25

MUC1, MUC15, and other mucins become functional when they interact with members of the ErbB family.13,14

MUC13 was found to interact with HER2 to drive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma progression.26

Our data demonstrated that MUC13 selectively modulates EGF-induced EGFR-PI3K-AKT signaling in iCCA but has negligible impact on HGF-stimulated signaling.

Physical interaction between MUC13 and EGFR promoted EGF-induced EGFR dimerization, impeded EGFR internalization and, by extension, modulated the expression of several downstream metastasis-related genes.

PARAGRAPH

Previous studies showed that miRNA expression is deregulated in cancer.

Both the loss and the gain of miRNA function contribute to cancer development.27

We hypothesized that the loss or suppression of miRNAs targeting MUC13 may cause aberrant MUC13 overexpression.

Our luciferase reporter assay identified miR-212-3p as an upstream MUC13 regulator that directly targets MUC13.

MiR-212-3p is dysregulated in certain cancers and has oncogenic or tumor suppressor functions.28,29

In the present study, we demonstrated that miR-212-3p was significantly downregulated in human iCCA tissues, and inhibited iCCA cell migration, invasion, and metastasis by targeting MUC13.

We demonstrated that aberrant CpG hypermethylation in the promoter area downregulated miR-212-3p in human iCCA tissues.

SECTION

CONCLUSIONS

PARAGRAPH

The present study demonstrated that MUC13 is upregulated by aberrant hypermethylation-induced miR-212-3p downregulation in iCCA cells.

It also showed that MUC13 overexpression promotes iCCA metastasis both in vitro and in vivo by interacting with EGFR and activating the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signal pathway (Figure 8F).

These results indicate a central role of MUC13 in iCCA progression and suggest that MUC13 has potential therapeutic value in the treatment of iCCA.

It could therefore be useful to design inhibitors targeting MUC13 expression or to use miR-212 mimics to control iCCA metastasis.

This hypothesis should be tested in a prospective study with postoperative iCCA patients.
