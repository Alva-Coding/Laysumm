TITLE

Intestinal HIF-1α deletion exacerbates alcoholic liver disease by inducing intestinal dysbiosis and barrier dysfunction

PARAGRAPH

Alcohol consumption alters gut microbiota and multiple intestinal barrier protecting factors that are regulated by intestinal hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α).

Absence of intestinal HIF-1α exacerbates gut leakiness leading to an increased translocation of bacteria and bacterial products to the liver, consequently causing alcoholic liver disease.

Intestinal specific upregulation of HIF-1α could be developed as a novel approach for the treatment of alcoholic liver disease.
