TITLE

Early initiation of antiviral therapy contributes to a rapid and significant loss of serum HBsAg in infantile-onset hepatitis B

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global public health problem that causes liver-related morbidity and mortality.1–3

Despite passive-active immunoprophylaxis using hepatitis B vaccination with or without hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg), up to 8%–10% of newborns of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers still acquire HBV infection.4

Most infected infants acquire HBV infection asymptomatically during perinatal period and have normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels; however, some cases may present with onset hepatitis with elevated ALT.5

As an unusual yet serious condition, infantile-onset hepatitis B after neonatal immunoprophylaxis has scarcely been studied.

PARAGRAPH

Previous reports showed that chronic infection was most likely to develop in children under 6 years of age, with an overall prevalence of 30%–50% rising to 80%–90% if they were infected as infants.6

Chronicity becomes a serious threat to HBV-infected infants.

However, according to current guidelines, no antivirals have been recommended for the population.

In view of the low therapeutic coverage when current treatment recommendations are followed and the worrisome consequences of HBV infection becoming chronic, more specialists argue that every measure should be considered to prevent progression of pediatric HBV infection.6,7

As a classical antiviral drug, lamivudine (LAM) has been shown to be safe and effective in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected infants and in preventing mother-to-infant transmission of HBV or HIV infection.8–12

Therefore, we designed the present study to assess the efficacy and safety of LAM for the treatment of infantile-onset hepatitis B.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Study population

PARAGRAPH

This is a real-world prospective cohort study.

From January, 2010 to December 2017, we enrolled consecutive infants under 1 year of age who fulfilled the following criteria: presence of HBsAg in serum, serum HBV DNA ≥105 IU/ml, persistent elevation of ALT (≥2× upper limit of normal (ULN, 40 IU/L)) without jaundice and no evidence of other comorbidities.

A frank conversation was held with the parents of each infant about the benefits and risks, both known and unknown of the antiviral treatments prior to the beginning of the study.

Finally, 18 families chose to receive antiviral therapy with LAM before 1 year of age (Group I); 11 families chose to initiate antiviral therapy with interferon (IFN) after 1 year of age (Group II) and infants in this group were given no antiviral drugs before 1 year of age.

For Group II, reevaluation of indications for antiviral therapy was performed before treatment initiation.

Written informed consent was obtained from each infant’s parents before the beginning of the study.

The study conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committees of the Fifth Medical Center (formerly Beijing 302 Hospital) of Chinese PLA General Hospital.

SECTION

Treatment regimen

PARAGRAPH

Infants in Group I received LAM monotherapy (4 mg/kg, daily9,11); IFN (3 MU/m2 to 5 MU/m2, qod) could be added to those who did not clear HBsAg after 1 year of age.

PARAGRAPH

Infants in Group II were initially treated with IFN monotherapy (3 MU/m2 to 5 MU/m2, qod).

LAM (4 mg/kg, daily) was added to those who had a decline in serum HBV DNA of <2log10 (by PCR, Roche COBAS® AmpliPrep, lower limit of detection: 20 IU/ml) after 3 months of IFN monotherapy.

PARAGRAPH

The main outcome measure was rate of serum HBsAg loss at month 12 of treatment.

Antiviral therapy should be terminated in cases of HBsAg seroconversion (disappearance of HBsAg and presence of anti-HBs) with undetectable HBV DNA.

After 12 months of treatment, infants who did not develop HBsAg seroconversion continued their therapies until HBsAg seroconversion or HBV e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion (disappearance of HBeAg and presence of anti-HBe) occurs.3

Fig. 1 shows the flow diagram of the study.

SECTION

Clinical monitoring

PARAGRAPH

Infants were monitored every 3 months.

Viral profile (HBsAg quantification (by Roche COBAS HBsAgII-Q, lower limit of detection: 0.05 IU/ml), anti-HBs, HBeAg, anti-HBe, HBV DNA) and liver function tests were routinely carried out at each visit and infants were clinically evaluated for any adverse effects.

The HBV reverse-transcriptase gene was sequenced in infants with clinically suspected LAM resistance.

The detailed sequencing procedure was provided in our previous paper.13

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Data analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA).

Continuous data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation.

Categorical data were expressed as the number of subjects or percentages.

Group comparisons were performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test or t test for continuous variables, and the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables.

Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the cumulative rates of HBsAg loss and differences were determined using the log-rank test.

Tests were two-sided and a p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

SECTION

Baseline characteristics

PARAGRAPH

A total of 29 infants were eventually included.

All mothers of the infants had positive serum HBsAg and HBeAg and high levels of HBV DNA, and were treatment-naive.

All infants were administered with HBV vaccine at birth.

Of these infants, 18 (11 boys and 7 girls) were in Group I and 11 (10 boys and 1 girls) were in Group II.

There were no statistical differences between Group I and Group II with respect to the characteristics at baseline (Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

Twelve infants in Group I and all infants in Group II underwent liver biopsy before therapy.

Grade of inflammation and stage of fibrosis in liver histology were evaluated according to Scheuer’s criteria.14

Fig. 2 depicts the distribution of grade of inflammation and stage of fibrosis between Group I and Group II.

G2 and S1 predominated in each group.

No statistical differences were found across the 2 groups with respect to grade of inflammation (p = 1.0000) or stage of fibrosis (p = 0.4606).

SECTION

Treatment response

PARAGRAPH

No infants in Group II developed spontaneous HBsAg loss before 1 year of age; while 9 infants receiving LAM monotherapy in Group I achieved HBsAg loss before 1 year of age.

There was a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (p = 0.0052).

PARAGRAPH

All infants in both Group I and Group II had undetectable HBV DNA by month 12 of treatment.

The change in mean ALT levels of the infants from baseline to month 12 of treatment is depicted in Fig. 3.

In Group I, the cumulative rates of HBsAg loss at month 3, 6, 9 and 12 of treatment were respectively 39% (7/18), 67% (12/18), 78% (14/18) and 83% (15/18).

A total of 15 infants developed anti-HBs at month 12 of treatment, 8 of whom developed anti-HBs before month 6.

In Group II, the cumulative rates of HBsAg loss at month 3, 6, 9 and 12 of treatment were respectively 18% (2/11), 27% (3/11), 27% (3/11) and 36% (4/11).

A total of 3 cases developed anti-HBs at month 12 of treatment, 2 of whom developed anti-HBs before month 6.

There were significant differences regarding the rates of HBsAg loss between the 2 groups at month 12 of treatment (p = 0.0169).

SECTION

Long-term follow-up

PARAGRAPH

During follow-up after 12-month treatment, 2 additional infants in Group I lost HBsAg, while no additional cases in Group II developed HBsAg loss.

The median duration of treatment in Group I and Group II was respectively 6 months and 12 months.

Eventually, all infants except 1 (18 in Group I, 10 in Group II) achieved HBsAg or HBeAg seroconversion in the study and accordingly ended their antiviral therapies.

These cases have been followed for a median of 102 months (range 17 to 105) since off-treatment.

No seroconversion occurred during off-treatment period and no relapse has been observed to date.

Overall, a total of 17 infants achieved HBsAg seroconversion and 1 developed HBeAg seroconversion in Group I; a total of 4 infants achieved HBsAg seroconversion and 6 developed HBeAg seroconversion in Group II.

Fig. 4 shows the cumulative rates of HBsAg loss from the beginning of the study.

Significant differences existed between Group I and Group II (p = 0.0023).

Group I had higher rates of HBsAg loss and HBsAg decreased more rapidly.

PARAGRAPH

One patient who was initially treated with IFN at 22 months of age in Group II discontinued his therapy at month 9 of treatment due to febrile convulsion.

His serum HBV DNA became undetectable at the time.

Then the patient switched to entecavir monotherapy from IFN and LAM combination therapy and is still on treatment to date.

His serum HBV DNA remains undetectable at the latest clinical visit, but HBeAg seroconversion has not been achieved.

PARAGRAPH

No serious adverse events were observed in the study.

Fever was the most common adverse event (4 in Group I; 9 in Group II).

Subsequently, neutropenia developed in 10 cases (3 in Group I; 7 in Group II), decreased appetite in 9 (2 in Group I; 7 in Group II), febrile convulsion in 1 (in Group II) and rash in 1 (in Group I).

All reported adverse events are listed in Table 2.

No adverse events were found among the infants who were treated with LAM alone.

Virological breakthrough or LAM resistance did not occur in the study.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The uncertainties regarding the natural history of HBV infection in children make development of guidelines for management of pediatric patients very complex.5

In an expert panel consensus from the United States and the sole clinical practice guideline from Europe,15,16 no treatment options are proposed for HBV-infected children younger than 1 year old.

Low therapeutic coverage exacerbated by restrictive treatment guidelines may facilitate disease progression in these patients.

Additionally, few large trials of antiviral therapy in children exist to guide treatment decisions.17

The conundrums often put physicians into a dilemma in real-world clinical practice.

PARAGRAPH

It is reported that the rate of spontaneous HBsAg clearance in Asians with vertically transmitted HBV is extremely low, between 0.5% and 1.4%.18

However, there is little published data that describes changes in HBV status in infancy.

One study that investigated the outcome of infantile hepatitis B showed that 7 in 20 cases with non-fulminant hepatitis developed chronic infection.5

In the present study, no infants in Group II before 1 year of age (as no-treatment control) developed spontaneous HBsAg loss.

Therefore, in view of the high rate of chronicity and its associated worrisome consequences, antiviral treatments in HBV-infected infants with elevated ALT levels and high viral load should be considered.

PARAGRAPH

Timing of treatment is a critical decision in order to maximize therapeutic benefit.19

In the present study, infants who initiated their antiviral therapies before 1 year of age (Group I) obtained more benefits than those who initiated therapies after 1 year of age (Group II).

Infants in Group I had higher rate of HBsAg loss, shorter treatment duration and lower incidence of adverse events.

Though the majority of cases in Group II developed HBeAg seroconversion, it is not an ideal goal for pediatric patients because negative HBeAg usually represents a still progressive and difficult-to-cure phase.20

PARAGRAPH

In the study, no LAM resistance was observed.

Reasons for this may be associated with the short treatment course in the majority of infants who achieved early cessation of therapy and the combination with IFN in some cases.21

Nevertheless, considering that LAM has not been widely used in many parts of the world because of its low-barrier to drug resistance, application of high-barrier-to-resistance antivirals in the special population can be further studied.

PARAGRAPH

A strength of our study is the well characterized cohort which provides new evidence for the optimal management of younger HBV-infected infants.

Nevertheless, it also has the limitation of sample size.

There is a need for further larger scale studies to validate the results, which may facilitate the improvement of current guidelines.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, early initiation of antiviral therapy can lead to a rapid and significant loss of HBsAg in HBV-infected infants with persistent elevation of ALT (≥2× ULN) under 1 year of age.

Further trials with larger cohorts are needed to verify our results.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report regarding antiviral therapy for infantile-onset hepatitis B.
