ABSTRACT

TITLE

Early initiation of antiviral therapy contributes to a rapid and significant loss of serum HBsAg in infantile-onset hepatitis B

PARAGRAPH

There is a paucity of data regarding antiviral therapy in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected infants aged <1 year who have elevated alanine aminotransferase.

This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of antiviral therapy initiated in infancy.

PARAGRAPH

A real-world cohort study was conducted from January 2010 to December 2017.

HBV-infected infants under 1 year of age, with persistent elevation of alanine aminotransferase and high viral load, were recruited and divided into 2 groups.

Group I included 18 infants whose parents chose to initiate antiviral therapy with lamivudine before 1 year of age.

Group II included 11 infants whose parents chose to initiate antiviral therapy with interferon-Î± after 1 year of age and not to receive any antiviral therapies before 1 year of age.

The main outcome measure was rate of serum HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) loss at month 12 of treatment.

PARAGRAPH

There were no statistical differences between Groups I and II regarding baseline characteristics.

No infants in Group II developed spontaneous HBsAg loss before 1 year of age.

In Group I, the cumulative rates of HBsAg loss at month 3, 6, 9 and 12 of treatment were 39%, 67%, 78% and 83%, respectively.

In Group II, the cumulative rates of HBsAg loss at month 3, 6, 9 and 12 of treatment were 18%, 27%, 27% and 36%, respectively.

Statistical differences existed in the cumulative rates of HBsAg loss between the 2 groups (log-rank test, p = 0.0023).

No serious adverse events occurred in the study.

PARAGRAPH

Early initiation of antiviral therapy for infantile-onset hepatitis B contributes to a rapid and significant loss of HBsAg.

Further trials with larger cohorts are needed to verify our results.
