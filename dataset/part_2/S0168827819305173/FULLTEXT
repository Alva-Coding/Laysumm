TITLE

TNF-α/IFN-γ profile of HBV-specific CD4 T cells is associated with liver damage and viral clearance in chronic HBV infection

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

In chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HBV-specific T cells plays a pivotal role in viral clearance and liver damage.

Studies on a chimpanzee model of HBV acute infection have demonstrated an irreplaceable role of CD8 T cells in HBV clearance and disease pathogenesis.1

In patients with chronic HBV infection, HBV-specific CD8 T cells usually show functional exhaustion or even clonal deletion,2–7 which is deemed a major reason for the HBV persistence in those patients.

PARAGRAPH

CD4 T cells, as the main regulating cell population, also play an important role in HBV clearance.

A mice model of HBV genome plasmid hydrodynamic transfection indicated a critical role of CD4 T cells in induction of CD8 T cell-mediated HBV clearance.8

Strong HBV-specific CD4 T cell responses have been observed in patients with self-limited acute HBV infection.9,10

A lack of HBV-specific CD4 T cell responses has been associated with HBV persistence in HBV/hepatitis C virus coinfection patients despite detectable HBV-specific CD8 T cells in those patients.11

Most of the studies on HBV-specific CD4 T cells have focused on the magnitude of response, and usually found a low frequency of HBV-specific CD4 T cells in patients with chronic HBV infection, resembling the T cell exhaustion in HBV-specific CD8 T cells.3–7

As a versatile cell population, detailed functional dissection of HBV-specific CD4 T cells has received less attention in previous studies.

The observation of an increased frequency of circulating HBV-specific follicular T helper (Tfh)-like cells in patients with HBV e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion has directly associated a functional subset of HBV-specific CD4 T cells with HBV viral control.12

Our previous study has identified HLA-DR as the major locus for susceptibility to HBV-related acute-on-chronic liver failure, indicating a role of CD4 T cells in the immune-pathogenesis of HBV-related acute-on-chronic liver failure.13

Compared to HBV-specific CD8 T cell epitopes, fewer HBV-specific CD4 T cell epitopes have been identified,14,15 which hinders detailed functional analysis of HBV-specific CD4 T cells.

PARAGRAPH

Persistent exposure to pathogen antigen has been indicated as the main cause of T cell exhaustion in mice with chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection.16

A lot of studies have correlated the HBV-specific T cell response with serum HBV antigen in patients with chronic HBV infection,3–7 while the discovery of preserved T cell function in young adults in the immune-tolerant phase argues against current knowledge about HBV-specific T cell exhaustion.17

Another scenario not matching current knowledge of HBV-specific T cell exhaustion is hepatitis B flare.

Patients with a hepatitis B flare show both high HBV viral load and rising HBV-specific T cell responses.18

Some of these patients would undergo HBeAg or even HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance after the flare, which indicates that the rising HBV-specific T cells in those patients is effective at HBV clearance.19

Those discrepancies indicate that some mechanisms, besides T cell exhaustion, might be involved in the regulation of HBV-specific T cell responses.

PARAGRAPH

In this study, we firstly analyzed the IFN-γ/TNF-α functional profile of HBV-specific CD4 T cells in 68 patients with chronic HBV infection with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) <2x the upper limit of normal (ULN).

Then, the IFN-γ/TNF-α functional profile of HBV-specific CD4 T cells was analyzed in 28 patients with a hepatitis B flare.

Additionally, for samples from HLA-DRB1*0803/HLA-DRB1*1202 patients, HLA-DRB1*0803/HLA-DRB1*1202 restricted CD4 T cell epitopes were identified.

Results

SECTION

HBV-specific CD4 T cells are dominated by TNF-α producing cells in patients with chronic HBV infection with ALT <2xULN

PARAGRAPH

HBV core and S-specific CD4 T cells were analyzed in 68 patients with chronic HBV infection with ALT <2xULN.

IFN-γ and TNF-α are recognized as 2 major cytokines of type 1 helper (Th1) CD4 T cells, we analyzed patients’ HBV-specific CD4 T cells by intracellular cytokine staining of those 2 cytokines.

The gating strategy of flow cytometry is illustrated in Fig. S3.

Similar to previous reports,3 HBV-specific CD4 T cells in patients with chronic HBV infection could hardly be detected by direct ex vivo antigen stimulation in our preliminary experiments (data not shown).

We analyzed HBV-specific CD4 T cells after 10 days of proliferation stimulated by HBV peptides in vitro for all the samples in this study.

PARAGRAPH

According to TNF-α and IFN-γ production, there were 3 distinct populations of HBV-specific CD4 T cells: TNF-α single producer, TNF-α/IFN-γ double producer, and IFN-γ single producer (Fig. 1A).

TNF-α producing cells were the dominant population in HBV-specific CD4 T cells: the mean (SD) frequency of HBV core-specific TNF-α producing CD4 T cells and that of HBV core-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells was 0.944% (1.743) and 0.579% (1.917%), respectively (p <0.001) (Fig. 1B, left); the mean (SD) frequency of HBV S-specific TNF-α producing CD4 T cells and that of HBV S-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells was 0.661% (1.106) and 0.376% (0.825), respectively (p = 0.001) (Fig. 1B, right).

There was no significant difference between the frequency of HBV core-specific CD4 T cells and that of HBV S-specific CD4 T cells (p >0.05) (Fig. 1C).

SECTION

HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells are associated with HBV viral clearance in patients with chronic HBV infection with ALT <2xULN

PARAGRAPH

Patients’ HLA-DR background, clinical and demographical information are shown in Table 1.

There were 4 groups of patients according to the HBeAg, HBsAg, and HBV DNA levels: HBeAg positive with high viral load (HVL, HBV DNA >1 × 106 IU/ml) (n = 12), HBeAg positive with low viral load (LVL, HBV DNA <2 × 105 IU/ml) (n = 13), HBeAg negative (n = 25), and HBsAg negative (n = 18).

PARAGRAPH

Firstly, we analyzed the association between the frequency of HBV-specific CD4 T cells and HBV viral clearance.

Although TNF-α producing cells were the dominant population in HBV-specific CD4 T cells, there was no significant difference in the frequency of this cell population between different patient groups (p >0.05) (Fig. 2A, upper).

The frequency of HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells increased in parallel with the elevated level of viral clearance in patients: the mean (SD) frequencies of HBV core-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells in HBeAg positive patients with HVL, HBeAg positive patients with LVL, HBeAg negative patients, and HBsAg negative patients were 0.104 (0.185), 0.000 (0.000), 0.494 (1.320), and 1.432 (3.286), respectively; the mean (SD) frequencies of HBV S-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells in HBeAg positive patients with HVL, HBeAg positive patients with LVL, HBeAg negative patients, and HBsAg negative patients were 0.094 (0.144), 0.016 (0.038), 0.351 (1.011), and 0.860 (0.907), respectively (Fig. 2A, lower).

PARAGRAPH

We then analyzed the association between the dominance of HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells and HBV viral control.

The dominance of HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells was calculated as the frequency of IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells divided by the sum of both the frequency of IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells and the frequency of TNF-α producing CD4 T cells.

For the patients with detectable HBV-specific CD4 T cells, the elevated level of viral clearance was also paralleled by an increase in the dominance of HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells: the mean (SD) dominance of HBV core-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells in HBeAg positive patients with HVL (n = 9), HBeAg positive patients with LVL (n = 8), HBeAg negative patients (n = 21), and HBsAg negative patients (n = 13) were 12.4% (12.2%), 0.0% (0.0%), 30.4% (28.2%), and 45.0% (30.8%), respectively; the mean (SD) dominance of HBV S-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells in HBeAg positive patients with HVL (n = 9), HBeAg positive patients with LVL (n = 9), HBeAg negative patients (n = 18), and HBsAg negative patients (n = 16) were 8.0% (7.8%), 15.8% (32.9%), 33.9% (30.8%), and 53.2% (31.5%), respectively (Fig. 2B).

Moreover, in patients without HBsAg loss, the HBsAg level was significantly negatively correlated with the dominance of HBV S-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells (Rs = −0.386, p = 0.020) (Fig. 2C, right), while no significant correlation between the HBsAg level and the frequency of HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells was observed (p >0.05) (Fig. 2D).

PARAGRAPH

In summary, those results indicate that HBV viral clearance is accompanied by an elevation in both the frequency and the dominance of HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells.

SECTION

HBV-specific TNF-α producing CD4 T cells are associated liver damage in hepatitis B flares patients

PARAGRAPH

The HBV-specific CD4 T cells in the previous patients with chronic HBV infection with ALT <2xULN are most likely in a state of quiescence, as those patients usually show none to mild liver inflammation.

To investigate the roles of HBV-specific CD4 T cells in the circumstance of robust immune response, we analyzed the HBV-specific CD4 T cells in 20 HBeAg positive and 8 HBeAg negative patients with chronic HBV infection with a hepatitis B flare.

All the patients received nucleot(s)ide analogues based antiviral therapy after admission, and patient 010 and patient 022 received a short-term (4–7 days) steroid treatment at admission.

Patients’ clinical information and blood sampling time are shown in Table S2.

For the 12 patients with multiple samples, the detailed changing of clinical characteristics and HBV-specific CD4 T cell response data are shown in Figs. S7 & S8.

PARAGRAPH

Compared to HBsAg positive patients with ALT <2xULN, patients with a hepatitis B flare had a higher frequency of HBV-specific CD4 T cells (p <0.05) (Fig. 3A).

HBsAg negative patients with ALT <2xULN had a higher frequency of HBV S-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells compared to patients with a hepatitis B flare (p = 0.038) (Fig. 3A, right), while there was no significant difference in the frequency of other populations of HBV-specific CD4 T cells between those 2 patient groups (Fig. 3A).

PARAGRAPH

TNF-α producing cell remained the dominant population in HBV-specific CD4 T cells in patients with a hepatitis B flare (p <0.05) (Fig. S4).

The frequency of HBV core-specific CD4 T cells was higher than that of HBV S-specific CD4 T cells in patients with a hepatitis B flare (p <0.05) (Fig. 3B).

PARAGRAPH

We correlated patients’ HBV-specific CD4 T cell response with patients’ HBV DNA levels at the first sampling point.

Patients’ HBV DNA levels were not significantly correlated with the frequency of any population of HBV-specific CD4 T cells (p >0.05) (Fig. S5).

PARAGRAPH

According patients’ ALT and total bilirubin (TBIL) data at the first sampling point, patients were grouped into 4 populations: ALT <1,000 IU/L and TBIL <60 μmol/L, ALT >1,000 IU/L and TBIL <60 μmol/L, ALT >1,000 IU/L and TBIL >60 μmol/L, ALT <1,000 IU/L and TBIL >60 μmol/L (Fig. S6), robust HBV-specific CD4 T-cell responses were detected only in patients from the latter 3 groups with advanced liver damage (Fig. 3C).

PARAGRAPH

To investigate the association between liver damage and the individual populations of HBV-specific CD4 T cells, we firstly correlated patients’ HBV-specific CD4 T cell response with patients’ ALT and TBIL levels at the first sampling point.

Only the frequency of HBV core-specific CD4 T cells was significantly positively associated with both ALT and TBIL levels (p <0.05) (Fig. 3D).

PARAGRAPH

Then, we compared the HBV-specific CD4 T cell response at 2 sampling time-points in the same patients.

Significant decrease was observed only in the frequency of HBV core-specific TNF-α producing CD4 T cells, when patients were undergoing alleviation of liver damage (simultaneous decrease in both ALT and TBIL) (p = 0.027) (Fig. 3E).

When patients were undergoing aggravation of liver damage (rising TBIL despite declining ALT), 4 out of 5 patients showed a rise above 40% in the frequency of HBV core-specific TNF-α producing CD4 T cells (p = 0.125) (Fig. 3F).

PARAGRAPH

Compared to PMA & ionomycin stimulated total CD4 T cells, the HBV-specific CD4 T cell population was dominated by a higher proportion of TNF-α producing CD4 T cells (p <0.05) (Fig. S9), which indicated that the dominance of HBV-specific TNF-α producing CD4 T cells in patients with a hepatitis B flare is not a result of increased TNF-α producing cells in total CD4 T cells.

PARAGRAPH

These results indicate that HBV core-specific TNF-α producing CD4 T cells might contribute to the aggravation of liver damage in patients with a hepatitis B flare.

SECTION

HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells are associated with HBV viral clearance in hepatitis B flares patients

PARAGRAPH

A total of 9 HBeAg positive patients with a hepatitis B flare had undergone HBeAg loss, and 3 of those 9 patients had also HBsAg loss shortly after the flare (Table S2).

No HBsAg loss was observed in the 8 HBeAg negative patients after the flare (Table S2).

Compared to HBeAg positive patients without HBeAg loss, patients with HBeAg loss showed lower HBeAg level at the initial time-point (Fig. 4A, upper) (p = 0.085).

Patients with HBsAg loss and patients without HBsAg loss showed comparable HBsAg level at the initial time-point (Fig. 4A, lower) (p = 0.766).

PARAGRAPH

We compared the HBV-specific CD4 T cell response at the first sampling time, between HBeAg positive patients with HBeAg loss and those without HBeAg loss.

Compared to patients without HBeAg loss, patients with HBeAg loss showed both higher frequency and higher dominance of HBV core-specific IFN-γ CD4 T cells (p <0.05) (Fig. 4B, upper).

After excluding the 3 patients with both HBeAg and HBsAg loss, patients with HBeAg loss still showed both a higher frequency and higher dominance of HBV core-specific IFN-γ CD4 T cells compared to patients without HBeAg loss (p <0.05) (Fig. 4B, lower).

PARAGRAPH

We compared the HBV-specific CD4 T cell response at the first sampling time, between patients with HBsAg loss and those without HBsAg loss.

Patients with HBsAg loss showed both higher frequency (p <0.05) (Fig. 4C, left) and higher dominance (p >0.05) (Fig. 4C, right) of HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells, compared to patients without HBsAg loss.

In contrast, the frequency of HBV-specific TNF-α producing CD4 T cells was not significantly higher (p >0.05) (Fig. S10A, left) and the dominance of those cells was even lower (p >0.05) (Fig. S10A, right) in patients with HBsAg loss, compared to patients without HBsAg loss.

For HBV S-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells, both the frequency and dominance of those cells were significantly positively correlated with the HBsAg fold decrease during flare in all the 28 patients (p <0.05) (Fig. 4D, upper left and lower left), while those significant correlations were not observed when excluding the 3 patients with HBsAg loss (p >0.05) (Fig. 4D, upper right and lower right).

For HBV core-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells, significant correlation was observed only between the frequency of those cells and the HBsAg fold decrease during flare in all 28 patients (p <0.05) (Fig. S11A, upper left).

PARAGRAPH

As the HBV-specific CD4 T cell response changed dramatically during flare, we wondered whether using the response data at the highest point could improve the association between HBV-specific T cell response and HBsAg loss.

Obvious improvement in the association between HBV S-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells and HBsAg loss was obtained when using the highest data of those cells (Fig. 4E and Fig. 4F).

Most strikingly, both the frequency and the dominance of HBV S-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells became significantly positively correlated with HBsAg fold decrease even in patients without HBsAg loss (p <0.05) (Fig. 4F, upper right and lower right).

When using the same strategy on other HBV-specific CD4 T cell populations (HBV-specific TNF-α producing CD4 T cells and HBV core-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells), no obvious improvement in the association between those cell populations and HBsAg loss were observed (Fig. 4E, Fig. S10B, Fig. S11B).

PARAGRAPH

Those results indicate the important roles of HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells in HBV viral clearance: HBV core-specific CD4 T cells might contribute to HBeAg loss, while HBV S-specific CD4 T cells might contribute to HBsAg loss.

SECTION

Differentiation of HBV-specific TNF-α producing CD4 T cells into HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells during hepatitis B flare

PARAGRAPH

Patient 010 had undergone both HBeAg and HBsAg loss, and IFN-γ producing cells had become the dominant population in HBV-specific CD4 T cells population after flare (Fig. S7).

Comparing the HBV-specific CD4 T cells to the same peptides pool at 2 sampling points in patient 010, it is reasonable to deduce that some IFN-γ producing cells might originate from TNF-α producing cells: the median fluorescence intensity value of IFN-γ in HBV peptides pool core07-specific CD4 T cells had increased dramatically from 317 at the first sampling point to 517 at the second sampling point, which indicated a process of obtaining IFN-γ producing ability during flare (Fig. 5A, upper); for HBV peptide pool S08 specific CD4 T cells, TNF-α producing cells were the only detectable population at the first sampling point, while IFN-γ producing cells become prominent at the second sampling point (Fig. 5A, lower).

This differentiation process from HBV-specific TNF-α producing cells into HBV-specific IFN-γ producing cells was also observed in some other patients with multiple sampling points.

PARAGRAPH

Patient 015 showed high HBV-specific CD4 T cell response and an extra PBMC sample was available at the second sampling point.

We analyzed the expression of other cytokines (IL-4, IL-17, and IL-21) as well as transcription factors (GATA3, T-bet, and RORγt) in the distinct population of HBV-specific CD4 T cells of this patient.

The gating strategy of flow cytometry is illustrated in Fig. S12.

A large proportion of total CD4 T cells stimulated by PMA & ionomycin showed strong IL-17 production especially in TNF-α single producers, while almost no IL-17 producing cells were detected in any subpopulation of HBV-specific CD4 T cells (Fig. 5B).

IL-21 producing cells were detected exclusively in TNF-α/IFN-γ double producers and IFN-γ single producers (Fig. 5B).

Compared to TNF-α/IFN-γ double producers and IFN-γ single producers, TNF-α single producers showed lower expression of both T-bet and RORγt (Fig. 5C).

IL-4 producing cells were barely detected in any subpopulation of HBV-specific CD4 T cells (Fig. S12A).

No difference in GATA-3 expression was observed between distinct subpopulations of HBV-specific CD4 T cells (Fig. 5C).

Identification of HBV-specific HLA-DRB1*0803/HLA-DRB1*1202-restricted CD4 T cell epitopes

PARAGRAPH

Peptides targeted by HLA-DRB1*0803 or HLA-DRB1*1202 patients are illustrated in Fig. 6A. Twelve HBV core derived peptides and 8 HBV S derived peptides/pairs were targeted by at least 1 HLA-DRB1*0803 patient.

Eleven HBV core derived peptides and 17 HBV S derived peptides/pairs were targeted by at least 1 HLA-DRB1*1202 patient.

PARAGRAPH

Cells from T cell lines of interest were stimulated with peptides or peptide-pulsed HLA-DRB1 matched allogeneic B lymphoblastoid cell lines (BLCLs) to test the HLA class II restriction of candidate peptides.

Representative data demonstrating HLA-DRB1*1202 restriction of HBV core166-180 are shown in Fig. 6B.

This method was used to examine the HLA-DRB1 restriction of the peptides targeted by at least 2 patients.

Peptide core46-60, core56-70, core66-80, core136-150, core161-175, B&C_S81-95, B&C_S156-170, B&C_S186-200 were verified to stimulate peptide-specific CD4 T cells in a HLA-DRB1*0803 restricted way (indicated with blue star in Fig. 6A).

Peptide core116-130, core166-180, B&C_S6-20, B&C_S36-50, B&C_S51-65, B&C_S56-70, B&C_S76-90, B&C_S141-155, C_S191-205 were verified to stimulate peptide-specific CD4 T cells in a HLA-DRB1*1202 restricted way (indicated with red star in Fig. 6A).

PARAGRAPH

Notably, using allogeneic BLCLs as antigen presentation cells (APCs) usually stimulated more peptide-specific CD4 T cells in patients’ T cell lines, compared to using autologous cells as APCs.

A feasible explanation is the high levels of HLA-DR, CD80, and CD86 expression on allogeneic BLCLs, which makes them far more potent APCs than patients’ autologous cells in the T cell lines (Fig. 6C).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this study, we firstly analyzed the TNF-α/IFN-γ profile of HBV-specific CD4 T cells in patients with chronic HBV infection with ALT <2xULN.

We found that both the frequency and the dominance of HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells increased in parallel with the elevated HBV viral clearance level in patients.

Scrutinizing previous studies which analyzed HBV-specific CD4 T cell response in HBeAg negative patients with different outcomes (HBsAg loss vs. HBsAg persistence) after nucleot(s)ide analogues or IFN-α treatment,4,6 a similar pattern of TNF-α/IFN-γ switching could also be found.

PARAGRAPH

We found a significantly higher frequency of HBV-specific CD4 T cells in patients with a hepatitis B flare compared to HBsAg positive patients with ALT <2xULN, indicating robust on-going T cell responses in those patients.

Further analysis revealed that strong HBV-specific CD4 T cell responses were observed exclusively in flare patients with advanced liver damage (ALT >1,000 IU/L and/or TBIL >60 μmol/L).

PARAGRAPH

A previous study by Tan et al. had detected no HBV-specific T cell response in patients with a hepatitis B flare.21

There might be 2 reasons for the failure to detect HBV-specific T cells in their study: firstly, they analyzed HBV-specific T cell response directly ex vivo, which undoubtedly increased the difficulty of detecting HBV-specific T cells; secondly, they analyzed HBV-specific T cells by IFN-γ and CD107a staining, while our data indicates that the TNF-α producing CD4 T cells are indeed the dominant population in HBV-specific CD4 T cells.

A recent study by Rivino L et al. also detected poor HBV-specific CD4 T cell response in patients with a hepatitis B flare with similar methods to ours.22

The reason that they did not find strong HBV-specific CD4 T cells might be because of their patient cohort.

Judging from the ALT data, patients in their study were actually in a ‘mild’ stage of flare.

PARAGRAPH

HBV core-specific TNF-α producing CD4 T cells were the dominant population in patients with a hepatitis B flare, and a close association between those cells and the liver damage was observed: firstly, the frequency of those cells was positively associated with both ALT and TBIL levels; secondly, the frequency of those cells changed in parallel with the severity of liver damage.

Those results indicate that HBV-specific TNF-α producing CD4 T cells might contribute the aggravation of liver damage in patients with a hepatitis B flare.

The frequency of HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells was not significantly correlated with serum ALT level in patients with a hepatitis B flare, which is consistent with Tan et al.’s finding of 1 patient without ALT flare despite increased HBV-specific IFN-γ producing T cell response.21

PARAGRAPH

A previous study by Zhang JY et al. found increased proportion of IL-17 producing cell in total CD4 T cells in patients with chronic HBV infection with acute-on-chronic liver failure,23 while we did not detect IL-17 production in HBV-specific TNF-α producing CD4 T cells.

TNF-α is the key effector molecule in the concanavalin A-induced CD4 T cell-dependent mice hepatitis model,24,25 and expression of TNF receptor 1 on myeloid-derived cells was proven to be irreplaceable for hepatitis in this model.26

Massive macrophage activation was observed in cirrhotic patients with lethal liver damage, which was attributed to gut-to-blood bacteria translocation.27

Whether HBV-specific TNF-α producing CD4 T cells could cause an aseptic inflammation cascade in patients with chronic HBV infection, by activating monocytes/macrophages, remains an issue worthy of further investigation.

PARAGRAPH

Comparing HBV-specific CD4 T cell responses at 2 sampling points indicates that some IFN-γ producing cells might originate from TNF-α producing cells during flare.

Previous studies found increased frequencies of HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells in patients with HBsAg loss, and attributed it to functional restoration of exhausted HBV-specific T cells.4,6

According to our data, the increased frequency of HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells during HBV viral clearance could be a result of both functional transition from TNF-α producing cells and functional restoration of pre-existing IFN-γ producing cells.

PARAGRAPH

We found a close association between HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells and HBV viral clearance: strong HBV core-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cell responses seemed to be required for HBeAg loss; and both high frequency and high dominance of HBV S-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells are not only associated with HBsAg loss but also with HBsAg decrease in patients without HBsAg loss.

Rinker et al. had analyzed HBV-specific T cell responses in HBeAg negative patients who discontinued nucleot(s)ide analogues treatment, and found no correlation between the HBV core-specific T cell response and HBsAg loss.28

It would be more informative if they had analyzed HBV S-specific T cell responses.

We also find IL-21 (major effector molecule of Tfh cells) producing cells in HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells, which might explain, to some extent, the effectiveness of this population for HBV viral clearance.

PARAGRAPH

The TNF-α/IFN-γ functional profile of HBV-specific CD4 T cells did not fit into the typical TNF-α/IFN-γ functional profile of exhausted CD4 T cells: our study revealed that TNF-α producing cells are the dominant population in HBV-specific CD4 T cells, while IFN-γ producing cells are the dominant population in exhausted CD4 T cells from mice chronically infected with LCMV.29

Actually, previous studies on T cell differentiation indicated that the dominance of TNF-α producing ability over IFN-γ producing ability is a functional profile of early differentiated T cells.30,31

TNF-α single producers in HBV-specific CD4 T cells showed low expression of T-bet (a transcription factor with vital roles in both Th1 and Tfh cell differentiation),32 which could explain the lack of IFN-γ and IL-21 expression in those cells.

We also found low expression of RORγt (a transcription factor mediating T helper 17 cell differentiation) in TNF-α single producers,33 which explained the lack of IL-17 expression in those cells.

Considering both the functional profile and the low expression of lineage specification related transcription factors in the TNF-α single producers of HBV-specific CD4 T cells, it is reasonable to speculate that those cells might be early differentiated cells.

Further works are needed to decrypt the detailed functional state and phenotype of those cells.

Gotto et al. had longitudinally tracked HBV-specific CD8 T cells in patients with short-term steroid treatment and found no negative impact of steroid treatment on HBV-specific CD8 T cells.34

In our study, patient 010 and patient 022, who had undergone both HBeAg and HBsAg loss after the flare, received short-term steroid treatment after admission to our hospital.

Patient 010 showed increased frequency of HBV-specific IFN-γ CD4 T cells and decreased frequency of HBV-specific TNF-α CD4 T cells.

It seemed that short-term steroid treatment can quench HBV-specific TNF-α producing CD4 T cell responses and enhance HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cell responses, although caution must be exercised in drawing any conclusion as this observation was made in a single patient.

PARAGRAPH

To summarize, our data identified distinct populations of HBV-specific CD4 T cells with different roles in chronic HBV infection.

HBV-specific TNF-α producing CD4 T cells are the dominant cell population and might contribute to liver damage, while successful differentiation of HBV-specific TNF-α producing CD4 T cells into IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells favors HBV viral clearance.

It would be beneficial to closely monitor the TNF-α/IFN-γ profile of HBV-specific CD4 T cells in patients with chronic HBV infection with increasing liver inflammation (a sign of ongoing immune response).

New therapeutic strategies for chronic HBV infection might be established, after deciphering the mechanism governing the process of differentiation from HBV-specific TNF-α producing CD4 T cells to IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells.
