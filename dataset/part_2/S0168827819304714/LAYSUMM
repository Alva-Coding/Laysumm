TITLE

Microbiota-driven gut vascular barrier disruption is a prerequisite for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis development

PARAGRAPH

The incidence of fatty liver disease is reaching epidemic levels in the USA, with more than 30% of adults having NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), which can progress to more severe non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

Herein, we show that disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier and gut vascular barrier are early events in the development of NASH.

We show that the drug obeticholic acid protects against barrier disruption and thereby prevents the development of NASH, providing further evidence for its use in the prevention or treatment of NASH.
