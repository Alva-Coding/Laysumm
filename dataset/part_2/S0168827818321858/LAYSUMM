TITLE

Abnormal neutrophil traps and impaired efferocytosis contribute to liver injury and sepsis severity after binge alcohol use

PARAGRAPH

Disease severity in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is associated with a significant presence of neutrophils (a type of immune cell) in the liver.

It remains unknown how alcohol affects the capacity of neutrophils to control infection, a major hallmark of ALD.

We found that binge alcohol drinking impaired important strategies used by neutrophils to contain and resolve infection, resulting in increased liver injury during ALD.
