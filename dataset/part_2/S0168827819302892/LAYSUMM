TITLE

Pravastatin combination with sorafenib does not improve survival in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma

PARAGRAPH

Sorafenib has proven efficacy for the treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

However, overall survival remains poor in these patients, so we were interested to see if the addition of a statin, pravastatin, improved outcomes in patients with advanced HCC.

This randomized-controlled trial demonstrated that the sorafenib-pravastatin combination did not improve overall survival in this study population compared to sorafenib alone.
