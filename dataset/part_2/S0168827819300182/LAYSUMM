TITLE

A novel HBx genotype serves as a preoperative predictor and fails to activate the JAK1/STATs pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma

PARAGRAPH

We classified a novel genotype of the full-length hepatitis B virus X gene (HBx), HBx-E2.

This genotype was identified in tumor and nontumor tissues from patients with hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma.

HBx-E2 could preoperatively predict the prognosis of patients with intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma, after resection.
