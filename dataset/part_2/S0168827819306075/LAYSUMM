TITLE

Impact of obeticholic acid on the lipoprotein profile in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is a chronic liver disease that is associated with an increased risk of developing cirrhosis and cardiovascular disease.

Recently, obeticholic acid (OCA), a farnesoid X receptor agonist, improved liver disease but led to an increase in cholesterol.

However, the impact of OCA on cholesterol is not well understood.

In the present study, we show that OCA therapy is associated with a detrimental increase in lipoprotein levels, which improves after drug discontinuation.
