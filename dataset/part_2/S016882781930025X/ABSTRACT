ABSTRACT

TITLE

Development of a prognostic score for recommended TACE candidates with hepatocellular carcinoma: A multicentre observational study

PARAGRAPH

Previous prognostic scores for transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) were mainly derived from real-world settings, which are beyond guideline recommendations.

A robust model for outcome prediction and risk stratification of recommended TACE candidates is lacking.

We aimed to develop an easy-to-use tool specifically for these patients.

PARAGRAPH

Between January 2010 and May 2016, 1,604 treatment-naïve patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), Child-Pugh A5-B7 and performance status 0 undergoing TACE were included from 24 tertiary centres.

Patients were randomly divided into training (n = 807) and validation (n = 797) cohorts.

A prognostic model was developed and subsequently validated.

Predictive performance and discrimination were further evaluated and compared with other prognostic models.

PARAGRAPH

The final presentation of the model was “linear predictor = largest tumour diameter (cm) + tumour number”, which consistently outperformed other currently available models in both training and validation datasets as well as in different subgroups.

The thirtieth percentile and the third quartile of the linear predictor, namely 6 and 12, were further selected as cut-off values, leading to the “six-and-twelve” score which could divide patients into 3 strata with the sum of tumour size and number ≤6, >6 but ≤12, and >12 presenting significantly different median survival of 49.1 (95% CI 43.7–59.4) months, 32.0 (95% CI 29.9–37.5) months, and 15.8 (95% CI 14.1–17.7) months, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

The six-and-twelve score may prove an easy-to-use tool to stratify recommended TACE candidates (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage-A/B) and predict individual survival with favourable performance and discrimination.

Moreover, the score could stratify these patients in clinical practice as well as help design clinical trials with comparable criteria involving these patients.

Further external validation of the score is required.
