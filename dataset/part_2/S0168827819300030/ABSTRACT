ABSTRACT

TITLE

Live donor liver transplantation for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma offers increased survival vs. deceased donation

PARAGRAPH

There are conflicting reports on the outcomes after live donor liver transplantation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

We aimed to compare the survival of patients with HCC, with a potential live donor (pLDLT) at listing vs. no potential donor (pDDLT), on an intention-to-treat basis.

PARAGRAPH

All patients with HCC listed for liver transplantation between 2000–2015 were included.

The pLDLT group was comprised of recipients with a potential live donor identified at listing.

Patients without a live donor were included in the pDDLT group.

Survival was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method.

Multivariable Cox regression was applied to identify potential predictors of mortality.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 219 patients were included in the pLDLT group and 632 patients in the pDDLT group.

In the pLDLT group, 57 patients (26%) were beyond the UCSF criteria whereas 119 patients (19%) in the pDDLT group were beyond (p = 0.02).

Time on the waiting list was shorter for the pLDLT than the pDDLT group (4.8 [2.9–8.5] months vs. 6.2 [3.0–12.0] months, respectively, p = 0.02).

The dropout rate was 32/219 (14.6%) in the pLDLT and 174/632 (27.5%) in the pDDLT group, p <0.001.

The 1-, 3- and 5-year intention-to-treat survival rates were 86%, 72% and 68% in the pLDLT vs. 82%, 63% and 57% in the pDDLT group, p = 0.02.

Having a potential live donor was a protective factor for death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67; 95% CI 0.53–0.86).

Waiting times of 9–12 months (HR 1.53; 95% CI 1.02–2.31) and ≥12 months (HR 1.69; 95% CI 1.23–2.32) were predictors of death.

PARAGRAPH

Having a potential live donor at listing was associated with a significant decrease in the risk of death in patients with HCC in this intention-to-treat analysis.

This benefit is related to a lower dropout rate and a shorter waiting period.
