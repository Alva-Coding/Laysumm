TITLE

Growth of hepatocellular adenoma during pregnancy: A prospective study

PARAGRAPH

The presence of hepatocellular adenoma in pregnant women requires special consideration, as it carries the risk of growth and haemorrhage.

In this study we followed 48 patients with hepatocellular adenoma <5â€¯cm during 51 pregnancies and found that a hepatocellular adenoma during pregnancy confers minimal risk to the pregnant woman and none to her child.
