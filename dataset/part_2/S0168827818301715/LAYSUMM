TITLE

Quantification of HBV core antibodies may help predict HBV reactivation in patients with lymphoma and resolved HBV infection

PARAGRAPH

In this study, we identified a subgroup of patients with lymphoma and resolved hepatitis B virus infection that had a high risk of hepatitis B virus reactivation after receiving rituximab-containing chemotherapy.

These findings will help optimize a preventive strategy, especially in hepatitis B virus endemic regions with limited healthcare resources.
