TITLE

Quantification of HBV core antibodies may help predict HBV reactivation in patients with lymphoma and resolved HBV infection

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

HBV reactivation is a common complication that may lead to a life-threatening liver decompensation in patients with chronic HBV infection (HBsAg positive) who receive cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy.

Prophylactic antiviral therapy is recommended for this patient population by guidelines of HBV management.1–4

For patients with resolved HBV infection (HBsAg negative and anti-HBV core antibody [anti-HBc] positive), HBV reactivation is best characterized in patients with lymphoma who are treated with B cell-depleting agents, such as rituximab, and the incidence of HBV reactivation ranged from about 10% to 30%.5–9

PARAGRAPH

Prophylactic antiviral therapy has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of HBV reactivation in patients with lymphoma and resolved HBV infection who received rituximab-containing chemotherapy, and is recommended by most clinical practice guidelines.1–4

Alternatively, the patients can be followed up regularly by monitoring HBV DNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels every 1–3 months, and start antiviral therapy upon HBV reactivation.7,8

In HBV endemic area, either prophylactic antiviral therapy or regular HBV DNA monitoring may cause significant burden on health resource allocation because approximately 60% of the adult population has resolved HBV infections.10

Therefore, the identification of high-risk patients for HBV reactivation will help in the optimization of a preventive strategy and resource allocation.

PARAGRAPH

Low or absent anti-HBV surface antibody (anti-HBs) at baseline was the best characterized risk factor of HBV reactivation in a previous series of patients with lymphoma and resolved HBV infection.6–9

However, the diagnosis criteria of HBV reactivation varied in previous studies, and some reported HBV reactivations may represent a transient HBV DNA increase that is not clinically significant.

Exploration of markers that may help predict the clinical outcome of HBV reactivation will further focus the limited health-care resources to the most vulnerable patient groups.

PARAGRAPH

The positivity of anti-HBc antibodies was used to be a marker of past HBV infections.

Recently, the quantification of anti-HBc levels by using a newly developed double-sandwich immunoassay has emerged as a new marker of chronic HBV infection.11,12

In the natural history of HBV infection, patients in the phases with hepatitis activity (the immune clearance and HBeAg-negative hepatitis phases) have higher anti-HBc levels than those in the immune tolerant or the inactive carrier phases.13,14

Anti-HBc levels were well correlated with ALT levels, an indicator of liver injury, and associated with the natural history and treatment response of HBV infection.13–16

In patients who received interferon or nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment, those with higher anti-HBc levels had a higher chance of HBeAg seroconversion than those with lower anti-HBc.17

PARAGRAPH

In patients with resolved HBV infection, the anti-HBc levels were higher in those with detectable serum HBV DNA (occult HBV infection) than those without detectable HBV DNA (past HBV infection only).15

This suggests that anti-HBc levels may reflect the residual HBV replication in patients with resolved HBV infection.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the quantitation of anti-HBc levels may be a marker indicating residual HBV load and may help predict the risk of HBV reactivation in patients with lymphoma and resolved HBV infection who received rituximab-containing chemotherapy.

In this study, we tested this hypothesis by analyzing the serum samples obtained from a prospective cohort study, and explored the value of baseline anti-HBc and anti-HBs levels for the prediction of HBV reactivation and clinical outcome.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Patients and study design

PARAGRAPH

This prospective cohort study (www.clinicaltrial.gov identifier: NCT 00931229) has been reported previously.7

The ethics committee of the National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan, approved the protocol amendment in November 2013 to continue enrollment, because a trend of inferior survival for patients with HBV reactivation was found in the 150 patients enrolled.

The same eligibility criteria were applied, including (1) histologically proven diffuse large B cell or follicular B cell Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, for which rituximab–cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP)-based chemotherapy was considered standard treatment according to current guidelines; (2) positive for serum anti-HBc and negative for HBsAg or anti-hepatitis C antibody; and (3) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0–2 and adequate organ function reserves.

Details of chemotherapy regimens and follow-up plan were reported previously.7

A written informed consent was obtained from all participating patients.

SECTION

Definition of HBV reactivation and hepatitis flare

PARAGRAPH

The HBV DNA levels were checked at baseline; at the start of every new cycle of rituximab–CHOP chemotherapy; and every four weeks for one year after completion of the rituximab–CHOP chemotherapy, as described previously.7

HBV reactivation was defined as a greater than 10-fold increase of HBV DNA compared with previous nadir levels.

For patients with baseline HBV DNA levels below the detection limit (1,000 copies/ml), HBV reactivation was defined as an increase of HBV DNA to greater than 10,000 copies/ml.

Hepatitis flare was defined as a greater than threefold increase of serum ALT level that exceeded 100 IU/L, and severe hepatitis was defined as a hepatitis flare with an ALT increase to more than 10-fold upper limit of normal or bilirubin to more than 1.5-fold upper limit of normal.

Patients with documented HBV reactivation were treated with entecavir and were followed, as described previously.

SECTION

Anti-HBc and anti-HBs quantification

PARAGRAPH

The anti-HBc levels were measured using the newly developed double-antigen sandwich immunoassay (Wantai, Beijing, China) calibrated using World Health Organization standards as reported previously.11,18

The anti-HBs levels were measured using enzyme immunoassay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Wantai), with a detection limit of 10 mIU/ml.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and the areas under the ROC curves were done using the baseline anti-HBc and anti-HBs data.

Youden index, which measured the maximal difference between the true positive rate and the false positive rate for the prediction of HBV reactivation, was used to determine the optimal cutoff levels of anti-HBc and anti-HBs.19

Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify predictors of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and HBV reactivation was incorporated into the models as a time-dependent covariate.20

Variables with a p value of <0.1 in the univariate analysis were considered as potential predictors of OS or PFS.

These factors and those variables with clinical interest were further explored through multivariate regression analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model to identify independent predictors of OS or PFS.21

Categorical variables were compared using Fisher’s exact test.

Continuous variables were compared using Student’s t test or Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test.

Survival was calculated using Kaplan–Meier’s method and compared using the log-rank test.

All of the analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

Results

SECTION

Patient characteristics

PARAGRAPH

From March 2014 to December 2015, 87 patients were screened and 47 patients were enrolled (Fig. 1).

The 47 new patients and the 150 previously enrolled patients are similar in terms of clinical characteristics and the chemotherapy received, except that a lower proportion of the new patients had abnormal ALT levels at baseline (Table S1).

Therefore, all of the analyses reported were done based on the whole cohort.

As of 30 April 2016, the median follow-up of the whole cohort was 57.0 months (range: 0.7–83.2).

The estimated five-year OS rate was 72.4% (95% CI 65.6–79.1) and the five-year PFS rate was 64.2% (95% CI 57.0–71.3) for the whole cohort.

Patients with follicular lymphoma had better PFS and OS, compared with those with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, but the difference was not statistically significant (Fig. S1).

Therefore, patients with the two histological subtypes were put together in all the following analyses.

PARAGRAPH

HBV reactivation occurred to 24 patients, with an incidence of 11.6/100 person-years.

The clinical characteristics were similar between patients with and without HBV reactivation, except that patients negative for anti-HBs at baseline were more likely to have HBV reactivation (Table 1).

HBsAg reversion and HBV-related hepatitis flares occurred in 17 and 15 patients with documented HBV reactivation, respectively.

No patient death was attributed to HBV-related events.

The objective response rates to rituximab–CHOP chemotherapy in 166 evaluable patients were similar between patients with or without HBV reactivation (77.3% and 85.4%; p = 0.35).

The major causes of death were lymphoma progression (33 patients) and infection (10 patients), also similar between patients with or without HBV reactivation (Table S2).

SECTION

Comparison of the kinetics of anti-HBc between patients with and without reactivation

PARAGRAPH

One hundred ninety-two patients had enough serum samples for the measurement of baseline anti-HBc/anti-HBs levels.

The median levels of anti-HBc and anti-HBs were 4.25 IU/ml (range: 0.23–191.86) and 72.3 mIU/ml (range: 0–12,513.5), respectively.

Twenty-one of the 24 patients with HBV reactivation had enough serum samples for serial analysis of anti-HBc levels.

We randomly selected 24 patients from the 171 patients without HBV reactivation as control.

Patients with HBV reactivation had significantly higher anti-HBc levels at baseline and more elevation of anti-HBc levels during follow-up (Table S3).

The increase in anti-HBc levels generally followed the increase in HBV DNA levels, with a median time from peak HBV DNA to peak anti-HBc levels of 4.0 weeks (range: −15 to 28.6 weeks).

The increase in anti-HBc levels was associated with hepatitis flare (Fig. S2), consistent with the findings that anti-HBc levels may correlate with the natural history of chronic HBV infection.13,14

PARAGRAPH

To further explore the association between anti-HBc kinetics and the outcome of HBV reactivation, we compared the outcome of patients with or without a greater than 10-fold of increase in anti-HBc levels during follow-up.

Patients with a greater than 10-fold of increase had significantly higher peak HBV DNA levels and a trend of more frequent severe hepatitis (Table S4).

SECTION

ROC analysis of anti-HBc/anti-HBs levels for the prediction of HBV reactivation

PARAGRAPH

The ROC analysis of baseline anti-HBc and anti-HBs levels indicated that the optimal cutoff value to predict HBV reactivation in our patients were 6.41 IU/ml for anti-HBc and 56.48 mIU/ml for anti-HBs (Fig. S3).

Either high anti-HBc (≥6.41 IU/ml) or low anti-HBs (<56.48 mIU/ml) was associated with a significantly higher risk of HBV reactivation (hazard ratio [HR] of 4.52 and 8.48, respectively; Table 2).

The data suggest that, as a single biomarker, anti-HBs may have a better predictive value than anti-HBc.

PARAGRAPH

We also checked the anti-HBc levels using samples collected at 7–10 weeks post the start of rituximab–CHOP chemotherapy.

Patients with HBV reactivation had significantly higher anti-HBc levels at follow-up (median 11.7 vs. 3.3 mIU/ml; p = 0.0007).

The ROC analysis indicated an optimal cutoff value of 5.883 mIU/ml, which had a similar predictive value to that using the baseline anti-HBc levels for HBV reactivation (Fig. S3).

SECTION

Clinical characteristics of the high-risk (anti-HBc-high and anti-HBs-low) patients

PARAGRAPH

Patients with both high anti-HBc and low anti-HBs had the highest risk of HBV reactivation, with an HR of 17.29 (95% CI 3.92–76.30; p = 0.0002; Table 2).

The baseline characteristics between the high-risk patients and other patients did not differ significantly, except that the proportion of women was higher in the high-risk group (Table S5).

The cumulative incidence of HBV reactivation at 15 months was 45.8% for the high-risk patients and 3.0–9.6% in other patients (Fig. 2).

In patients with documented HBV reactivation, the high-risk patients tended to have a higher proportion of hepatitis flare and severe hepatitis flare (Table 3).

However, statistical significance was not reached, possibly because of the small sample size.

SECTION

Clinical outcome of the patients with or without HBV reactivation

PARAGRAPH

The results of the univariate Cox regression analysis of PFS and OS are listed in Table S6.

The multivariate analysis indicated that high lactate dehydrogenase levels and HBV reactivation are the two independent predictors of inferior OS (Table 4).

The association between HBV reactivation and poorer OS or PFS was consistent whether HBV reactivation was considered as a continuous covariate in terms of time to first HBV reactivation or as a dichotomous, time-dependent covariate.

The results indicate that the earlier HBV reactivation occurred, the poorer OS and PFS would be.

The trend is consistent in patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma or follicular lymphoma (Fig. S4).

The high-risk group tended to have inferior OS and PFS compared with other patients, but the difference was not statistically significant (Fig. S5).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this study, we demonstrated that, by using quantification of anti-HBc and anti-HBs levels at baseline, we could identify a high-risk subgroup of patients with lymphoma and resolved HBV infection that had a cumulative risk of HBV reactivation of about 45% at 15 months, and more than 40% of these high-risk patients had severe HBV-related hepatitis flare.

These findings support the use of quantification of anti-HBc and anti-HBs levels at baseline to optimize the preventive strategy for this potentially life-threatening complication, especially in HBV endemic regions with limited health resources.

Our data also imply that HBV reactivation may predict inferior PFS and OS whose biological and clinical significance warrants further investigation.

PARAGRAPH

The positivity of serum anti-HBc is the most commonly used marker to confirm the history of HBV infection.12

Quantification of serum anti-HBc has been explored as a marker of HBV-induced hepatitis and the adaptive immune response against HBV infection as well.12–14

Core antigens are produced from covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), the transcriptional and replicative template of HBV.

Therefore, high baseline anti-HBc levels may reflect the amount of residual core antigens produced by replication-competent cccDNAs in hepatocytes.

In addition, anti-HBc levels may increase in response to the increase of serum viral naked core antigens released from damaged hepatocytes.15,16

The production of anti-HBc may indicate the host immune response to HBV, which is also associated with T cell-mediated hepatitis.22

The association between the increase of anti-HBc levels and hepatitis flare upon HBV reactivation in our kinetic study may thus suggest a more active immune-related hepatitis in these patients.

PARAGRAPH

Low or undetectable anti-HBs at baseline is consistently associated with a higher risk or HBV reactivation.6–9

Kusumoto et al.9 found that patients with anti-HBs levels <10 and 10–100 mIU/ml had HRs of 20.6 and 5.2, respectively, for HBV reactivation, compared with patients with anti-HBs level >100 mIU/ml.9

This study supports our findings of anti-HBs quantification for the definition of the high-risk group.

On the other hand, Seto et al.8 did not identify a level of anti-HBs as a protective threshold, and thus, recommended a dichotomous readout of anti-HBs positivity to define the high-risk group.

The previously reported cutoff value of anti-HBc to differentiate HBsAg-negative individuals into HBV DNA-positive and HBV DNA-negative ones (6.6 IU/ml) was very close to the value that best identify the risk of HBV reactivation in our study (6.41 IU/ml).

It implies that an optimal cutoff value of anti-HBc may be defined to allow dichotomous anti-HBc readout for the characterization of the different natural histories of patients with resolved HBV infection.

PARAGRAPH

Other virological factors may also help predict HBV reactivation in lymphoma patients with resolved HBV infection.

Detectable HBV DNA at baseline, which occurred in <10% of patients with resolved HBV infection, was also associated with a higher risk of HBV reactivation in some studies.5,9

A recent report indicated that HBV core-related antigen, which has been shown to correlate with the intrahepatic activity of cccDNA, was associated with an increased risk of HBV reactivation in patients with occult HBV carriers receiving intensified immunosuppressive therapy.23

It remains undetermined whether these virological markers may also predict HBV-related hepatitis flare or other long-term clinical outcomes.

Our findings that patients with high anti-HBc and low anti-HBs at baseline tended to have more frequent and more severe hepatitis flare imply that prophylactic antiviral therapy is most beneficial for this group of patients in terms of clinical-outcome improvement.

Its efficacy in improving the patients’ long-term outcome should be validated in future clinical trials.

PARAGRAPH

There are several limitations of this study.

First, external validation of the cutoff value of anti-HBc/anti-HBs levels to define the high-risk populations is needed for future clinical application.

Second, the optimal preventive strategy in patients without the high-risk features remains undefined.

The relative benefit of routine prophylactic antiviral therapy vs. regular HBV DNA monitoring for the low-risk population should be studied further.

Issues to be considered in the low-risk group may include the optimal duration of prophylactic antiviral therapy, the optimal interval and duration of HBV DNA monitoring, and the cost-effectiveness.

Third, although a trend of inferior survival associated with HBV reactivation was found in our study, we did not find HBV-related mortality in our patients, or difference in the causes of death between patients with or without HBV reactivation.

Further studies to explore the potential interaction between antiviral and antitumor immunity and its impact on clinical outcome are warranted.24–26

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, our data indicate that, in patients with lymphoma and resolved HBV infection that receive rituximab-containing chemotherapy, a high-risk subgroup of patients of HBV reactivation and HBV-related hepatitis flare can be identified by using quantification of anti-HBc and anti-HBs levels at baseline.

This high-risk group of patients should be considered the highest priority for prophylactic antiviral therapy in regions with limited medical resources.
