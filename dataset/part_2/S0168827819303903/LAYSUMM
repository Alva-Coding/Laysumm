TITLE

ALDH2 deficiency promotes alcohol-associated liver cancer by activating oncogenic pathways via oxidized DNA-enriched extracellular vesicles

PARAGRAPH

Alcoholics with an ALDH2 polymorphism have an increased risk of digestive tract cancer development, however, the link between ALDH2 deficiency and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development has not been well established.

In this study, we show that ALDH2 deficiency exacerbates alcohol-associated HCC development both in patients and mouse models.

Mechanistic studies revealed that after chronic alcohol exposure, Aldh2-deficient hepatocytes produce a large amount of harmful oxidized mitochondrial DNA via extracellular vesicles, which can be delivered into neighboring HCC cells and subsequently activate multiple oncogenic pathways, promoting HCC.
