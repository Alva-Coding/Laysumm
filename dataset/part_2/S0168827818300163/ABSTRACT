ABSTRACT

TITLE

Controlled attenuation parameter and alcoholic hepatic steatosis: Diagnostic accuracy and role of alcohol detoxification

PARAGRAPH

Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) is a novel non-invasive measure of hepatic steatosis, but it has not been evaluated in alcoholic liver disease.

Therefore, we aimed to validate CAP for the assessment of biopsy-verified alcoholic steatosis and to study the effect of alcohol detoxification on CAP.

PARAGRAPH

This was a cross-sectional biopsy-controlled diagnostic study in four European liver centres.

Consecutive alcohol-overusing patients underwent concomitant CAP, regular ultrasound, and liver biopsy.

In addition, we measured CAP before and after admission for detoxification in a separate single-centre cohort.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 562 patients were included in the study: 269 patients in the diagnostic cohort with steatosis scores S0, S1, S2, and S3 = 77 (28%), 94 (35%), 64 (24%), and 34 (13%), respectively.

CAP diagnosed any steatosis and moderate steatosis with fair accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] ≥S1 = 0.77; 0.71–0.83 and AUC ≥S2 = 0.78; 0.72–0.83), and severe steatosis with good accuracy (AUC S3 = 0.82; 0.75–0.88).

CAP was superior to bright liver echo pattern by regular ultrasound.

CAP above 290 dB/m ruled in any steatosis with 88% specificity and 92% positive predictive value, while CAP below 220 dB/m ruled out steatosis with 90% sensitivity, but 62% negative predictive value.

In the 293 patients who were admitted 6.3 days (interquartile range 4–6) for detoxification, CAP decreased by 32 ± 47 dB/m (p <0.001).

Body mass index predicted higher CAP in both cohorts, irrespective of drinking pattern.

Obese patients with body mass index ≥30 kg/m2 had a significantly higher CAP, which did not decrease significantly during detoxification.

PARAGRAPH

CAP has a good diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing severe alcoholic liver steatosis and can be used to rule in any steatosis.

In non-obese but not in obese, patients, CAP rapidly declines after alcohol withdrawal.
