TITLE

Controlled attenuation parameter and alcoholic hepatic steatosis: Diagnostic accuracy and role of alcohol detoxification

PARAGRAPH

CAP is a new ultrasound-based technique for measuring fat content in the liver, but has never been tested for fatty liver caused by alcohol.

Herein, we examined 562 patients in a multicentre setting.

We show that CAP highly correlates with liver fat, and patients with a CAP value above 290â€¯dB/m were highly likely to have more than 5% fat in their livers, determined by liver biopsy.

CAP was also better than regular ultrasound for determining the severity of alcoholic fatty-liver disease.

Finally, we show that three in four (non-obese) patients rapidly decrease in CAP after short-term alcohol withdrawal.

In contrast, obese alcohol-overusing patients were more likely to have higher CAP values than lean patients, irrespective of drinking.
