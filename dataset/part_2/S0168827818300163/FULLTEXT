TITLE

Controlled attenuation parameter and alcoholic hepatic steatosis: Diagnostic accuracy and role of alcohol detoxification

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Alcohol is a key risk factor for liver-related and overall mortality, contributing to 3.3 million annual deaths worldwide.1

Simple steatosis is the most common liver manifestation of harmful drinking, but is considered a benign condition by many, since the disturbed lipid metabolism normalises with abstinence.2,3

The high prevalence of steatosis in most liver diseases has even cast doubt on the role of hepatic fat on fibrosis progression, with steatosis being discussed as a bystander rather than a causative factor.4,5

This notion may, however, be too credulous, as 7% of patients with simple alcoholic steatosis have been shown to progress to cirrhosis within five years.6

Additionally, in non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease, steatosis is an independent risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.7

Finally, harmful drinking is often accompanied by similar unfavourable health behaviours, such as overeating, smoking, and a sedentary lifestyle.

Thus, components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) are common in alcoholic patients, where they may aggravate steatosis and act in synergy with alcohol to progress fibrosis.8

Consequently, reliable non-invasive tools to diagnose and monitor hepatic steatosis in patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) are needed.

PARAGRAPH

Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) is a novel method for the non-invasive assessment of steatosis, which measures the increased attenuation of ultrasound waves when travelling through steatotic hepatic tissue, compared to normal liver.9

The CAP software is incorporated into the FibroScan® (Echosens, Paris, France) equipment, allowing for combined transient elastography (TE) and CAP.

An individual patient data meta-analysis recently showed that CAP diagnosed moderate and severe steatosis with diagnostic accuracies above 0.85 in mixed-aetiology liver-disease patients.

However, the analysis did not include ALD patients.10

To date, no sufficiently large biopsy-verified study exists to analyse the performance of CAP in patients with ALD.

PARAGRAPH

We, therefore, aimed to determine the diagnostic value of CAP for the evaluation of hepatic steatosis in patients with an excessive use of alcohol.

Secondary aims were to assess CAP before and after alcohol detoxification, and to evaluate the correlation between CAP and components of the MetS in alcohol overusers.

SECTION

Materials and methods

PARAGRAPH

We prospectively recruited patients at four European liver centres.

All patients signed a consent form prior to inclusion (ethical approvals S-20120071, S-20160021, S150/2015, 1629487v0, 485/08.11.2015).

SECTION

Patients

PARAGRAPH

Included patients were 18–75 years of age and reported a prior or ongoing use of alcohol exceeding the maximum recommended limit of three units per day for men and two units per day for women (1 unit = 12 g of alcohol), with a period of excessive drinking for at least one year.

PARAGRAPH

We included two cohorts of patients.

First, a diagnostic cohort that consisted of consecutive patients referred to four secondary and tertiary centres in Denmark, Germany, France, and Romania.

A liver biopsy was performed on suspicion of acute or chronic ALD caused by elevated liver function tests and/or elevated liver stiffness.

The centres in Germany, Romania, and France are inpatient hospital clinics where patients are primarily admitted for detoxification or acute alcohol injury.

In contrast, the Danish centre is an outpatient clinic where asymptomatic patients are referred from general physicians, municipal alcohol rehabilitation units, and smaller regional hospitals to assess the degree and potential complications of ALD.

These patients were abstaining from alcohol for at least one week.

PARAGRAPH

Second, a detoxification cohort that consisted of consecutive patients referred for detoxification to the German centre.

These patients contributed data to the analysis of changes in CAP during alcohol withdrawal, but were not biopsied.

We excluded patients with failed CAP measurements, concomitant liver disease other than ALD, liver malignancy, hepatic congestion, or bile duct dilation evidenced by ultrasound.

SECTION

Timing of investigations

PARAGRAPH

For the diagnostic cohort, all investigations, including a liver biopsy, were performed within 72 h, either during an outpatient visit or at the beginning of hospitalisation.

PARAGRAPH

For patients in the detoxification cohort, we performed baseline investigations at hospital admission, including laboratory testing, metabolic profiling, CAP, TE, and abdominal ultrasonography.

At the day of discharge from the hospital, we repeated CAP and TE.

SECTION

CAP and TE

PARAGRAPH

Experienced nurse operators (>500 scans) performed all CAP and TE measurements with the equipment FibroScan and with patients fasting for a minimum of 4 h, after a 5–10 min of rest in the supine position.

We labelled TE measurements as reliable if at least 10 valid measurements were obtained with an interquartile range (IQR)/median ratio below 30%.11

Since the criteria for CAP reliability were not yet established, we considered CAP measurements as reliable if at least 10 valid measurements were obtained.

However, after a publication suggested the CAP IQR below 40 dB/m as a reliability criterion, we performed post hoc subgroup analyses as well.12

Finally, we investigated five literature-based cut-off values for CAP, rounded to the nearest 10: 250, 260, 270, 280, and 290 dB/m.10

SECTION

Metabolic profiling and abdominal ultrasonography

PARAGRAPH

We recorded a patient’s medical history with regard to diabetes, arterial hypertension, medication, and smoking history.

We further characterised patients metabolically with body mass index (BMI); hip, waist, and abdominal circumference; arterial blood pressure; haemoglobin A1C; fasting blood glucose; triglycerides; total cholesterol; and low-density and high-density lipoprotein (HDL).

PARAGRAPH

We used the International Diabetes Federation criteria to define MetS.13

The definition requires the presence of central obesity plus any two of four additional metabolic risk factors.

Central obesity is defined as waist circumference ≥94 cm for males and ≥80 cm for females, and/or BMI above 30 kg/m2 for both genders.

The risk factors are raised triglycerides ≥1.7 mmol/L, reduced HDL cholesterol ≤1.03 mmol/L in males or ≤1.29 mmol/L in females, raised blood pressure ≥130 mmHg systolic or ≥85 mmHg diastolic, and raised fasting plasma glucose ≥5.6 mmol/L or previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

Any medical treatment for dyslipidaemia, arterial hypertension, and/or diabetes is factored in the equation.

We used the bright liver echo pattern (BLEP) as suggestive of steatosis on B-mode ultrasound.14

BLEP is defined as a higher-than-expected discrepancy in the echo brightness between the liver and kidney parenchyma.

SECTION

Liver histology

PARAGRAPH

We performed percutaneous liver biopsies with a Menghini suction needle in patients from the diagnostic cohort.

Liver samples were immediately stored in 4% formalin and embedded in paraffin, before Sirius Red staining to detect collagen fibres, and haematoxylin and eosin staining to detect intracellular lipid droplets.

We considered a biopsy of sufficient quality if the length exceeded 10 mm with the presence of five or more portal tracts.

PARAGRAPH

One liver pathologist per centre assessed liver histology semi-quantitatively according to the Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network domains of steatosis and fibrosis.15

Steatosis was scored as S0: <5%, S1: 5–33%, S2: >33–66%, and S3: >66%.

Fibrosis was staged as F0: no fibrosis; F1: perisinusoidal, portal, or periportal fibrosis; F2: perisinusoidal fibrosis in combination with portal or periportal fibrosis; F3: bridging fibrosis; and F4: cirrhosis.15

SECTION

Statistical analyses

PARAGRAPH

We report summary data as means and standard deviations (mean ± SD) or medians and IQRs according to distribution, with the Student’s t test and Wilcoxon’s rank sum test for parametric and non-parametric between-group significance testing.

PARAGRAPH

We evaluated the discriminative accuracy of CAP to diagnose any steatosis (≥S1), moderate steatosis (≥S2), and severe steatosis (=S3) using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), with leave-one-out cross validation for internal validation and subgroup analyses for participating centres, alcohol use up to inclusion, presence of BLEP, fibrosis stage, and CAP IQR <40 dB/m.

We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for the predefined cut-off values listed previously.

DeLong test was used for AUC comparisons.

We summarised the calibration of CAP using the Brier score and Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness of fit.

PARAGRAPH

We performed explorative, univariable, linear-regression analyses to investigate predictors of CAP and changes in CAP during detoxification, with p ≤0.100 to select potential predictors for multivariable regressions.

In the multivariable-regression analyses, we then determined which variables independently predicted CAP and the change of CAP during withdrawal of alcohol (ΔCAP) using backwards, step-wise elimination with a Bonferroni-corrected p value to adjust for multiple testing.

We tested the following 21 predictors: age, gender, BMI, presence of MetS, number of metabolic risk factors, central obesity, diabetes or glucose intolerance, elevated triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, arterial hypertension, alcohol consumption, years of excessive drinking, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, international normalised ratio, platelet count, ferritin, model of end-stage liver disease adjusted for sodium, and baseline TE.

For the diagnostic cohort, we added abstinence at inclusion, histological steatosis score, and fibrosis stage to the potential predictors.

For the detoxification cohort, we also tested the number of days admitted for detoxification and CAP at baseline as potential predictors of ΔCAP.

A p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

We used Stata 15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) for the statistical analyses.

Results

SECTION

Participants

PARAGRAPH

From May 2013 to August 2017, we enrolled 269 patients with concomitant liver biopsy and CAP measurement to the diagnostic cohort.

For the detoxification cohort, we included 293 patients among 329 eligible patients admitted for detoxification from May 2013 to October 2016.

The two groups differed on several parameters (Table 1): Detoxification patients had a more severe alcohol drinking history, more biochemical evidence of hepatic inflammation, and higher model of end-stage liver disease adjusted for sodium.

In the diagnostic cohort, 102 patients (38%) had biopsy-verified bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis.

In the detoxification cohort, 24 patients (8%) had ultrasonographic evidence of cirrhosis and nine (3%) had ascites.

SECTION

CAP to grade histological steatosis in ALD

PARAGRAPH

Prevalence of histological steatosis in the diagnostic cohort was 71% (192/269 patients).

The 29% without steatosis were more likely to be abstinent for >1 week up to inclusion, female, and/or with a BMI below 30 kg/m2.

CAP in the diagnostic cohort was 274 ± 60 dB/m and increased significantly for each histological steatosis grade, in contrast to BMI and waist circumference (Fig. 1).

CAP diagnosed any steatosis (≥S1) and moderate steatosis (≥S2) with fair accuracy, whereas the diagnostic accuracy for severe steatosis (= S3) was good (Table 2).

We did not find any significant differences in subgroup analyses of active drinking vs. abstinence at inclusion, country of origin, presence of BLEP, and fibrosis stage.

In post hoc subgroup analyses of CAP IQR as a marker of reliability,12 the accuracy of CAP to diagnose any steatosis was significantly better if IQR was below 40 dB/m (p = 0.006 for IQR <40 dB/m vs. IQR ≥40 dB/m).

PARAGRAPH

None of the five predefined diagnostic cut-off values reached a correct classification rate above 74% (Table 3).

CAP above 290 dB/m ruled in any steatosis with a specificity of 88% and a PPV of 92%, but none of the evaluated cut-off values, could adequately rule in moderate or severe steatosis caused by low specificities and PPVs (Fig. 2).

CAP below 280 dB/m ruled out severe steatosis with a sensitivity of 94% and an NPV of 99%, while sensitivities and NPVs for the evaluated cut-offs were below 90% for ruling out any or moderate steatosis (Table 3).

We, therefore, subsequently calculated optimal rule out and rule in cut-offs by optimising sensitivity and specificity to 90%, respectively (Table 2).

CAP below 220 dB/m ruled out any steatosis with 90% sensitivity, but the NPV was only 62%.

CAP had to exceed 339 dB/m to rule in severe steatosis (Fig. 2).

SECTION

Diagnostic accuracy of CAP compared to other markers of steatosis

PARAGRAPH

CAP diagnosed steatosis with higher diagnostic accuracies than BMI, waist circumference, and BLEP.

The differences were statistically significant, with p <0.02 for AUC comparisons, except for any steatosis, where CAP vs. waist circumference and CAP vs. BLEP did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.123 and p = 0.051).

There was no added effect of combining CAP with BMI or waist circumference.

However, combining CAP with BLEP significantly increased the accuracy for diagnosing any steatosis (combination CAP and BLEP AUC = 0.86; 95% CI 0.81–0.92; p = 0.021 for comparison with CAP alone) and severe steatosis (AUC = 0.83; 0.77–0.90; p = 0.005), but not moderate steatosis (AUC = 0.82; 0.76–0.88; p = 0.094).

SECTION

Effect of detoxification and abstinence on CAP values

PARAGRAPH

We measured CAP at admission and discharge in 293 patients admitted for detoxification for a median of 6.3 days (IQR 4–6, range 3–26).

CAP declined during hospitalisation (from 293 ± 50 to 261 ± 56 dB/m, p <0.001), with a mean difference in CAP of 32 ± 47 (range, 193 dB/m decline to 107 dB/m increase).

While CAP declined during detoxification in the majority of patients (76%), we observed stable or increasing CAP in 72 patients (24%), 13 of whom experienced more than 40 dB/m increase.

We located seven potential predictors of delta CAP during detoxification in univariable linear regression: number of days admitted for detoxification, diabetes or glucose intolerance, elevated triglycerides, years of excessive drinking, alkaline phosphatase, ferritin, and baseline CAP at admission.

In multivariable-regression analysis, using a Bonferroni-adjusted p value of 0.007 to control for multiple testing, three variables independently predicted delta CAP: number of days admitted for detoxification (coefficient 4.25, 95% CI 2.08–6.41; p <0.001), baseline CAP at admission (coefficient 0.28; 0.18–0.38; p <0.001), and elevated triglycerides (coefficient −14.50; −4.45 to −24.55; p = 0.005).

PARAGRAPH

Of patients in the diagnostic cohort, 84 (31%) were abstaining from alcohol for more than four weeks prior to inclusion (average 12 weeks abstinence, IQR 8–20, range 1–51).

CAP was significantly lower in abstainers (mean 253 ± 56) vs. ongoing drinkers (mean 284 ± 59; p <0.001), and the distribution of histological steatosis also differed: 76 (90%) of abstainers had <33% fatty hepatocytes (steatosis score 0–1) vs. 90 (49%) of ongoing drinkers with >33% fatty hepatocytes (steatosis score 2–3).

However, there was no statistically significant difference in the diagnostic accuracy of CAP to diagnose steatosis in subgroup analyses of abstainers vs. drinkers.

Besides, abstinence up to inclusion or magnitude of drinking did not predict CAP in multivariable-regression analysis (see as follows).

SECTION

Predictors of CAP

PARAGRAPH

From the diagnostic cohort, we identified 15 potential predictors of CAP from univariable linear-regression analyses: gender; age; BMI; presence of MetS; number of metabolic risk factors; central obesity; elevated triglycerides; low HDL; arterial hypertension; ongoing drinking at inclusion; magnitude of alcohol consumption at inclusion; histological steatosis scores; and levels of GGT, alkaline phosphatase, and platelets.

In multivariable regression with backwards elimination, using a Bonferroni-adjusted p value of 0.003, three variables independently predicted CAP: histological liver steatosis score (coefficient 28.4; 22.8–34.0; p <0.001), BMI (coefficient 4.2; 3.0–5.3; p <0.001), and age (coefficient 0.8; 0.3–1.3; p = 0.001).

PARAGRAPH

In the detoxification cohort of heavy drinkers, 11 variables potentially predicted CAP at admission: age; BMI; presence of MetS; number of metabolic risk factors; central obesity; diabetes or glucose intolerance; arterial hypertension; and levels of GGT, AST, platelets, and ferritin.

Only two independently predicted CAP at admission, using a Bonferroni-adjusted p value of 0.005: BMI (coefficient 3.70; 2.41–4.99; p <0.001) and GGT (coefficient 0.02; 0.01–0.029; p <0.001).

SECTION

Effect of metabolic risk factors on CAP

PARAGRAPH

Forty-five patients in the diagnostic cohort (21%) and 134 patients in the detoxification cohort (46%) had MetS according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria.13

The number of metabolic risk factors averaged two in the diagnostic cohort and three in the detoxification cohort (range 0–5).

The prevalence of BMI above 30 kg/m2 was 43/223 (19%) and 33/293 (11%) in the diagnostic and detoxification cohort, respectively.

In both cohorts, patients with MetS had higher CAP than patients without MetS: In the diagnostic cohort, the average difference in CAP was 40 dB/m (302 ± 64 in patients with MetS vs. 262 ± 55 in patients without MetS; p <0.001), while the difference was 22 dB/m in the detoxification cohort (306 ± 47 vs. 284 ± 50; p <0.001).

We observed the same for obese patients with BMI ≥30 kg/m2.

The difference in CAP was 49 dB/m in the diagnostic cohort (311 ± 48 in obese patients vs. 261 ± 57 in patients with BMI <30; p <0.001) and 28 dB/m in the detoxification cohort (318 ± 41 vs. 290 ± 51; p = 0.003).

During detoxification, CAP decreased equally in patients with and without MetS, resulting in a similar difference at discharge (25 dB/m) (Fig. 3A).

In contrast, CAP did not significantly decrease during detoxification in obese patients with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 (Fig. 3B).

SECTION

CAP and liver stiffness

PARAGRAPH

The FibroScan system obtains CAP measurements in parallel with liver stiffness measurements (TE) as non-invasive marker of fibrosis.

In post hoc analyses, we, therefore, evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of TE for diagnosing advanced fibrosis (≥F3), and assessed whether TE and CAP influenced each other, as indicated by a recent study.16

PARAGRAPH

TE diagnosed advanced fibrosis with excellent accuracy (AUC 0.96; 95% CI 0.93–0.98) in the diagnostic cohort with a 38% prevalence of advanced fibrosis.

The optimal cut-off was 13.2 kPa, with corresponding sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 91%, 94%, 90%, and 95%.

When using a literature-based cut-off of 15 kPa, as recommended by Baveno VI, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 90%, 95%, 91%, and 94%, respectively.17

Moreover, we did not find evidence to suggest that TE influenced CAP or vice versa.

First, CAP and TE did not correlate (correlation coefficient 0.0842).

Second, the diagnostic accuracies of CAP did not significantly differ in subgroups of histological Kleiner fibrosis score F0–1, F2, and F3–4 (Table 2; all p >0.1).

Third, we also did not find any difference in mean CAP, when divided on three groups of liver stiffness (<10 kPa, 10–15 kPa, and ≥15 kPa; p >0.4 for all group comparisons).

Finally, there were no statistically significant differences in mean TE, when divided on equal-sized CAP tertiles (all p >0.2 for group comparisons).

Taken together and in contrast to reports on other liver-disease aetiologies, we did not find evidence of interdependence of CAP and liver stiffness in patients with ALD.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this large multicentre study on CAP in alcoholic fatty-liver disease, we found CAP to be the best point-of-care non-invasive tool for steatosis assessment.

Despite only moderate to good diagnostic accuracy, CAP was superior to B-mode ultrasound for predicting liver steatosis.

A CAP above 290 dB/m was identified a good cut-off for ruling in steatosis.

We also found that CAP decreased rapidly and significantly during alcohol detoxification, except in obese patients.

Similarly, BMI predicted CAP independently of histological steatosis stage and patient age.

PARAGRAPH

Our results support the use of CAP together with TE for evaluation of ALD patients with concomitant steatosis and fibrosis assessment.

Given the potential of CAP to capture the dynamics of alcohol withdrawal, the method may be particularly suited for monitoring patients during and after alcohol rehabilitation.18–20

Importantly, our data suggest that CAP is superior to B-mode ultrasound for scoring steatosis, in line with previous studies in other liver-disease aetiologies.21

In contrast, the diagnostic accuracy of CAP seems inferior compared to magnetic resonance imaging-based proton density fat fraction, although the latter has not been tested for ALD steatosis.22

PARAGRAPH

The diagnostic accuracies in our study were poorer than in the most recent meta-analysis.10

This could be related to several aspects: First, a recent analysis showed that CAP had a poor diagnostic accuracy in patients with cholestatic liver disease, a pattern that can be present in patients with ALD.12

Although we found GGT to be an independent predictor of CAP at admission for detoxification, no other marker of cholestasis, such as elevated bilirubin, predicted CAP.

Consequently, this finding may simply be ascribed to more severe drinking in patients with elevated GGT, and consequently higher risk of steatosis.

Second, we were able to show that CAP decreased during detoxification, similar to what is known for liver stiffness19,23 and BLEP.24

Thus, the timing of liver biopsies with CAP measurements in patients admitted for detoxification could also explain some of the variability and lower diagnostic accuracy at lower steatosis stages.

However, CAP accuracy did not improve in subgroup analyses of patients abstaining from alcohol for more than one week up to inclusion, nor did abstinence or alcohol consumption levels independently predict CAP in the diagnostic or prognostic cohort.

Third, we did not find a correlation between CAP and liver stiffness, nor was TE a predictor of CAP, as reported for non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease patients.16

Taken together, we are not able to explain the modest diagnostic accuracy of CAP by alcohol drinking pattern, higher liver stiffness, or more advanced fibrotic liver disease.

It also remains open whether a recently identified relationship between apoptosis and liver fat in ALD patients may contribute to our findings.25

Further studies with a higher number of patients may be able to explore subgroup differences in more detail than our data allowed.

PARAGRAPH

Notably, we found a strong, independent, positive correlation between CAP and metabolic risk factors, primarily BMI, in both cohorts.

This is in agreement with previous studies in other liver-disease aetiologies, but has not been shown in ALD before.12,26

It also confirms prior studies showing that obesity limits the resolution of steatosis (assessed by BLEP) after alcohol withdrawal.27

The combined effects of alcohol and poor metabolic health on liver steatosis may help explain the excess risk of end-stage liver disease when BMI and alcohol consumption interact.28

PARAGRAPH

Another finding was the rapid decline in CAP during short-term alcohol withdrawal.

The decrease in CAP was independently predicted by a longer duration of alcohol withdrawal and higher CAP values at admission.

In contrast, elevated triglycerides negatively predicted CAP decrease, and CAP did not significantly decrease in obese patients during detoxification.

Interestingly, CAP was also recently associated with the level of histological apoptosis in patients with ALD, which, surprisingly, increased during alcohol detoxification.25

Taken together, factors, such as apoptosis, dyslipidaemia, and concomitant obesity, may, therefore, explain why CAP remained constant or even increased in 24% of our patients during detoxification.

PARAGRAPH

In summary, our multicentre study identifies CAP as an accurate bedside tool to detect and follow up the grade of steatosis in alcoholic fatty-liver disease, and stresses the synergy between harmful drinking and poor metabolic health on the development of liver steatosis.

Superior time efficiency, cost, and availability make CAP the most convenient and reliable non-invasive marker of steatosis in patients with ALD.

Finally, the fact that CAP does not decrease during alcohol detoxification in obese patients highlights the key role of fat metabolism in patients with ALD.
