TITLE

Positron emission tomography/computed tomography with 18F-fluorocholine improve tumor staging and treatment allocation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of death from cancer worldwide, developing on cirrhosis in 95% of cases.1

In this setting, the diagnosis of HCC relies on non-invasive conventional imaging criteria (computed tomography [CT] and/or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and/or histology.2–4

Conventional imaging (liver CT and/or MRI and lung CT) enables HCC staging according to the Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer (BCLC) system, linking each stage to therapeutic modalities.1,5

Accurate staging with reliable imaging methods is therefore crucial to determine the best treatment strategy.6

PARAGRAPH

Positron emission tomography-CT (PET/CT) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), a marker of glycolysis in cells, is used for staging and assessment of treatment response in several cancers.7

18F-FDG PET/CT has been proposed to detect poorly differentiated HCC,7,8 but is limited by its inability to detect well-differentiated HCC; consequently, it is not currently recommended for HCC staging.7,9

In contrast, PET/CT using 18F-fluorocholine (18F-FCH), a precursor of phospholipid synthesis, could be a useful marker of well-differentiated HCC.10,11

Therefore, dual-tracer PET/CT, using both 18F-FDG and 18F-FCH, is likely to detect both well- and poorly differentiated HCC, and might be valuable for tumor staging before treatment.11–13

However, to date, the role of 18F-FCH in HCC staging has been assessed only in small studies that included a limited number of patients.

Thus, the added value of dual-tracer PET/CT compared to conventional imaging remains unknown.14–18

PARAGRAPH

In France, regulatory agencies have authorized the use of 18F-FCH and 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with cancers, including HCC, in routine, and such functional imaging is currently refunded in clinical practice.

Our aim was therefore to assess the added value of dual-tracer PET/CT compared to conventional imaging for improving tumor staging and ultimately modifying treatment strategies in patients with HCC.

Selection of patients

PARAGRAPH

Patients with active HCC on conventional imaging or a history of HCC and suspicion of new HCC, who had been investigated with dual-tracer PET/CT (18F-FDG PET/CT and 18F-FCH PET/CT) between 2012 and 2015, were retrospectively identified in the nuclear medicine database of two French academic centers (APHP Henri Mondor Hospital, Créteil and APHP Jean Verdier Hospital, Bondy).

The study has been approved by a local ethics committee.

HCC was confirmed using either non-invasive criteria in case of cirrhosis (the European Association for the Study of the Liver Guidelines 2012) or histological analysis by tumor biopsy.4

Conventional imaging consisted of liver MRI alone + pulmonary CT in 42 patients, liver CT + pulmonary CT in 77 patients and liver MRI + liver CT + pulmonary CT in 73 patients.

All MR examinations were performed on a 1.5-T or 3 T MRI system and included in- and out-of-phase T1 weighted imaging (WI) sequences, breath-hold fat-suppressed T2 WI sequences, breath-gated single-shot diffusion-weighted spin echo planar imaging (DWI), followed by dynamic breath-hold 3D T1WI repeated before and five times after injection of gadolinium chelates, including a delayed phase no earlier than 3 min after injection.

CT examinations were performed using at least 64 slices.

All scans were obtained during breath-hold and covered the entire liver parenchyma.

CT scans were performed before and repeated twice after intravenous bolus injection of 1.5 cc/kg of contrast agent, at a rate ≥3.5 cc/s using a power injector.

Contrast-enhanced scanning of the liver in the arterial phase was initiated 20 s after aortic density peaked at 100 UH on bolus scanning.

A second scan covering the abdomen and pelvis was initiated 30 s after the arterial phase, while a delayed scan of the liver was initiated no earlier than 3 min after the start of injection.

PARAGRAPH

Number, size and location of each HCC were recorded based on conventional imaging.

Clinical and biological data, including gender, age, underlying liver disease, Child-Pugh classification and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, were collected.

PARAGRAPH

HCC staging using the BCLC classification, and a treatment strategy proposal based on conventional imaging (liver MRI or CT and pulmonary CT), as decided upon during a tumor multidisciplinary board (TMB) meeting, were retrospectively collected from TMB reports.

BCLC C stage was divided into BCLC C1 and BCLC C2 according to the absence of extrahepatic metastasis (BCLC C1) or the presence of extrahepatic metastasis (BCLC C2).

The different clinical situations for which dual-tracer PET/CT were performed were: 1) active HCC staging before treatment; 2) unexplained rise in serum AFP; 3) a doubtful lesion on conventional imaging; and 4) assessment before liver transplantation in patients with a history of HCC, but without active HCC.

SECTION

18F-FDG and 18F-FCH PET/CT imaging

PARAGRAPH

Dual-tracer PET/CT was performed after the first TMB.

When new lesions were identified, PET/CT was reviewed during a second TMB to assess potential changes in staging and treatment allocation.

Median time frames between conventional imaging and 18F-FDG PET/CT or 18F-FCH PET/CT (depending on which was first) were 20 and 26 days, respectively, and median time frame between 18F-FDG PET/CT and 18F-FCH PET/CT was eight days.

PARAGRAPH

18F-FDG and 18F-FCH PET/CT scans were performed on at least two separate days.

All acquisitions were performed using a dedicated PET/CT scanner instrument (Gemini GXL 16; Philips, Da Best, The Netherlands and Gemini TF 16, Philips Medical Systems, The Netherlands).

PARAGRAPH

All referred patients underwent whole-body PET/CT imaging 50–60 min after intravenous injection of 5 MBq/kg 18F-FDG, and 15 min after intravenous injection of 5 MBq/kg 18F-FCH.

For 18F-FDG PET/CT, they were required to fast for at least 6 h before undergoing the scan; blood glucose levels had been previously verified using a dedicated electronic device to ensure a level of <1.5 g/L.

A low-dose helical CT (120 kV, 80–100 mAs) was first performed for anatomical correlation and attenuation correction.

Then, whole-body emission images were acquired using 11–13 overlapping bed positions of 2 min each and reconstructed using a line of response-row action maximum likelihood algorithm (2 iterations, 28 subsets, postfilter 5.1 mm), with and without CT attenuation correction (matrix size of 128 × 128, voxel size 4 × 4 × 4 mm3).

SECTION

18F-FDG and 18F-FCH PET/CT analysis

PARAGRAPH

18F-FDG and 18F-FCH PET/CT were reviewed by two physicians specialized in nuclear medicine (JC, MS) and experienced in both 18F-FCH and 18F-FDG PET scan interpretation.

Both readers were aware of patient history and results of conventional imaging.

For 18F-FDG and 18F-FCH, a lesion was considered positive for HCC if it was a non-physiologic focus of high uptake without an imaging context of being benign.

For 18F-FCH, a liver lesion could also be considered positive in case of a hypometabolic image in an untreated area.

Semi-quantitative analysis was also performed, whereby a 3D region of interest was manually drawn over the lesion and over surrounding non-cancerous liver tissue to determine the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the tumor and surrounding non-tumor liver region.

The tumor-to-non-tumor ratio (TNR) of the SUVmax values was then calculated.

PARAGRAPH

We collected any new lesions detected by 18F-FDG PET/CT and 18F-FCH PET/CT, as well as any changes in the BCLC classification based on dual-tracer PET/CT.

To determine the impact of 18F-FDG PET/CT alone or 18F-FCH PET/CT alone on tumor staging, we retrospectively staged the tumor according to new lesions described separately by either technique.

For treatment allocation, we recorded any modification in treatment-proposal-based dual-tracer PET/CT, as decided during the second TMB.

Assessment of treatment modification based on 18F-FDG PET/CT alone or 18F-FCH PET/CT alone was not possible because of the retrospective nature of the study, with simultaneous assessment of both PET/CT during TMB.

Follow-up ended in April 2017; median follow-up was 35 months.

PARAGRAPH

New lesions identified by PET/CT were confirmed as HCC during follow-up based on the following: i) Histological analysis of the lesion; and/or ii) acquisition of typical radiological features of HCC (wash-in and wash-out on either MRI or CT) for intrahepatic lesions; iii) progression at imaging, defined by an increase in size of over 100% at one year for extrahepatic lesions.

PARAGRAPH

All cases with new lesions detected by dual-tracer imaging were reviewed by an experienced radiologist.

None of the new lesions were detectable on conventional imaging at the time of the first TMB.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Categorical data were represented as number (percentage) and continuous variables were represented as median (minimum-maximum).

Categorical variables were described as n and%, and continuous variables as median (minimum-maximum).

Analysis of positivity of PET/CT was performed per patient.

Performance of 18F-FDG and 18F-FCH PET/CT to detect new HCC lesions per patient and change the BCLC classification were compared using the McNemar test (two-tailed).

Statistical analysis was performed using R and Graphpad software; a p value <0.05 was considered as significant.

Results

SECTION

Characteristics of the patients

PARAGRAPH

A total of 192 dual-tracer PET/CT (18F-FDG PET/CT and 18F-FCH PET/CT) performed in 177 patients with HCC between 2012 and 2015 were included (Fig. 1).

Patients were mainly males (n = 155, 87.5%), with a median age of 62 years and with underlying cirrhosis in 71% of cases.

Causes of liver disease were: alcohol ± non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (n = 46, 26%), viral (n = 109, 62%) or unknown (n = 22, 12%).

An extensive description of the population is provided (Table 1).

In 136 out of 192 cases (72%), active HCC was identified on conventional imaging.

Diagnosis of HCC was based on histological (n = 87) and/or non-invasive imaging criteria (n = 49).

SECTION

Results according to PET/CT indications

PARAGRAPH

When active HCC was identified on conventional imaging (n = 136), 18F-FDG PET/CT was positive in 62.5% of cases, whereas 18F-FCH PET/CT was positive in 78% of cases (p = 0.6056, McNemar test compared to 18F-FDG PET/CT) and dual-tracer PET/CT in 83% of cases.

PARAGRAPH

In 122 out of 192 cases (64%), at least one active HCC was identified by conventional imaging, and dual-tracer PET/CT was performed for staging before treatment (Fig. 1): evaluation before listing for transplantation (n = 35), evaluation before curative treatment excluding liver transplantation (resection or percutaneous ablation, n = 45) or evaluation before palliative treatment (transarterial chemoembolization, Y90 internal radiation, oral-targeted therapies, n = 42).

Patients were HCC treatment-naive in 60% of cases and had been previously treated in 40% of cases.

PARAGRAPH

In the remaining 70/192 cases (36%), reasons for performing dual-tracer PET/CT were: evaluation before listing for transplantation, without active HCC on conventional imaging, after curative therapies or transarterial chemoembolization (n = 36), investigation of an unexplained rise in serum AFP (n = 9) or evaluation of doubtful lesions (intrahepatic or extrahepatic) on conventional imaging (n = 25) (Fig. 1).

Among the 25 patients with doubtful lesions (doubtful intrahepatic ± extrahepatic lesions in seven cases and doubtful extrahepatic lesions in only 18 cases, including vascular invasion, lung, bone, lymph nodes, peritoneum, chest wall), 14 patients had at least one concomitant typical HCC on conventional imaging.

The remaining 11 patients had no typical active HCC identified on conventional imaging and were included in a screening program for tumor recurrence after treatment of a previous HCC.

SECTION

Dual-tracer PET/CT for HCC staging

PARAGRAPH

Among the 122 patients with dual-tracer PET/CT performed for HCC staging, staging based on conventional imaging alone using the BCLC classification was: BCLC 0 in eight cases (7%), A in 53 cases (43%), B in 32 cases (26%), C1 without extrahepatic spread in 21 cases (17%) and C2 with extrahepatic spread in eight cases (7%) (Table 1).

18F-FDG PET/CT alone and 18F-FCH PET/CT alone identified new lesions in 20 (16%) and 21 patients (17%), respectively (p = 1.00, McNemar test), whereas dual-tracer PET/CT identified new lesions in 26 (21%) patients (Table 2).

Dual-tracer PET/CT identified an additional 5% of new HCC lesions compared to 18F-FDG PET/CT alone, and 4% compared to 18F-FCH PET/CT alone (Fig. 2A).

New lesions identified by dual-tracer PET/CT were intrahepatic alone, and/or vascular invasion (58%) and extrahepatic alone (42%).

No new lesions were identified in BCLC 0, and identification of new extrahepatic lesions with dual-tracer PET/CT increased with the baseline BCLC stage (3% in BCLC A to 37% in BCLC C2) (Fig. 2B).

Extrahepatic lesions (11 cases) were located in bones (60% of cases), lungs (25% of cases) and lymph nodes (3% of cases) (Table 2).

Among 26 new lesions identified by dual-PET/CT, 24 (92%) were confirmed as HCC based on histological findings (n = 7, 27%) or follow-up imaging (n = 18, 63%).

One hypermetabolic lesion corresponded to breast cancer and one patient was lost to follow-up.

PARAGRAPH

Taking into account the new lesions identified by PET/CT, BCLC staging was upgraded in 12 cases (10%) and 10 cases (8%), with 18F-FDG PET/CT alone and 18F-FCH PET/CT alone, respectively (p = 0.68, McNemar test), and in 14 cases (11%) with dual-tracer PET/CT (p = 0.47 vs. 18F-FDG alone and p = 0.1336 vs. 18F-FCH alone, McNemar test) (Table 3, Fig. 2B and C).

BCLC staging modification was distributed as follows: in one case BCLC staging was upgraded from A to B; in five cases it was upgraded from B to C; in six cases it was upgraded from A to C; in two cases BCLC staging was upgraded from C without extrahepatic spread to C with extrahepatic spread.

No new lesions, modifications in staging or treatment allocation were observed in the eight patients with HCC classified as BCLC 0 (Fig. 2B and 2C).

Staging modification was slightly higher with 18F-FDG alone than with 18F-FCH alone in BCLC A patients (43% of BCLC A in conventional imaging alone, compared to 38% in conventional imaging plus 18F-FDG alone, and 40% in conventional imaging plus 18F-FCH alone) and in BCLC C1 patients (17% of BCLC C1 in conventional imaging alone compared to 21% in conventional imaging plus 18F-FDG alone, and 19% in conventional imaging plus 18F-FCH alone) (Fig. 2C).

PARAGRAPH

Considering dual-tracer PET/CT findings, treatment strategy was modified in 17 cases (14%) (Table 3).

Modifications to treatment strategy based on baseline BCLC classification are shown (Fig. 2A and C).

In the pre-transplant setting, BCLC stage was upgraded in two cases (5.5%), both leading to dropout from the transplant project (Table 4).

In the population assessed for curative treatment (excluding liver transplantation), BCLC was upgraded in seven cases (15.5%), six of them leading to treatment modification (imaging-guided locoregional therapy or systemic therapy instead of hepatic resection or radiofrequency in five cases, and surgical removal of the extrahepatic lesion combined with scheduled hepatic resection in one case) (Table 4).

In the population predicted to receive palliative treatment, BCLC staging was upgraded in five cases (12%; from B to C in two cases, from A to C in one case, from C without extrahepatic spread to C with extrahepatic spread in two cases), leading to treatment modification in three cases (7%, systemic treatment instead of locoregional treatment).

An example of stage migration and modification of treatment allocation is shown (Fig. 3).

In five patients, new lesions identified by either 18F-FDG PET/CT or 18F-FCH PET/CT led to treatment modification despite no change in BCLC staging (treatment targeting a new extrahepatic lesion or vascular invasion, or bilobar locoregional treatment, where only unilobar treatment had initially been scheduled).

PARAGRAPH

In treatment-naïve patients with active HCC (n = 74), dual-tracer PET/CT identified new lesions in 21% of cases, leading to BCLC modification in 12% of cases and treatment modification in 15% (Table 5).

We observed the same proportion of new nodules, modification of tumor staging and treatment allocation modification in treatment-naive patients (n = 74) and in patients previously treated for HCC and considered for restaging (n = 48) (Table S1).

SECTION

Dual-tracer PET/CT in other clinical settings

SECTION

Unexplained rise in serum AFP

PARAGRAPH

In the setting of an unexplained rise in serum AFP, new lesions were identified with dual-tracer PET/CT in four out of the nine cases (44%, one positive with 18F-FDG PET/CT alone, one positive with 18F-FCH PET/CT alone and two positive with both tracers) (Fig. 1 and Table 3).

Among the four patients with new lesions identified by PET/CT, two had new intrahepatic lesions, one had new extrahepatic lesions, and one had both new intrahepatic and extrahepatic lesions, all confirmed based on histology findings or progression seen on imaging during follow-up.

For these patients, surgical resection, ablation or sorafenib was decided upon based on PET/CT findings.

SECTION

Dual-tracer PET/CT for doubtful lesions on conventional imaging

PARAGRAPH

Among the 25 patients with doubtful lesions (either intra- or extrahepatic) on conventional imaging, positive lesions were observed in four cases (16%) with 18F-FDG PET/CT alone vs. 10 cases (40%) with 18F-FCH PET/CT alone (p = 0.07, McNemar) and 11 cases (44%) with dual-tracer imaging (Fig. 1 and Table 3).

Biopsy confirmed extrahepatic HCC in six cases; imaging progression confirmed malignancy in four cases, and one patient was lost to follow-up.

In 10 cases, dual-tracer PET/CT results led to treatment modification (systemic treatment because extrahepatic spread was confirmed in five patients, resection or ablation instead of follow-up in five cases) (Table 3).

Among the 14 patients with doubtful lesions negative on dual-tracer PET/CT, one of the lesions was finally diagnosed as HCC, whereas 11 lesions were not HCC at the end of follow-up and two patients were lost to follow-up.

SECTION

Evaluation prior to liver transplantation without active HCC after bridging therapies

PARAGRAPH

Among the 36 patients investigated before listing for transplantation, without active HCC on conventional imaging after complete tumor response following bridging therapy, dual-tracer PET/CT identified new lesions in three patients (8%): two patients had bone lesions (imaging progression confirming malignancy during follow-up), thereby excluding them from the transplantation program, and one patient had intrahepatic HCC, leading to a new round of chemoembolization before liver transplantation (confirmed as active HCC on explant) (Fig. 1 and Table 3).

Among these three new lesions detected by dual PET/CT, one was positive on 18F-FDG PET/CT and all three were positive on 18F-FCH PET/CT.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Our results show that dual PET/CT (18F-FDG PET/CT and 18F-FCH) is able to identify HCC lesions not detected by conventional imaging, whilst improving the BCLC classification and subsequent management of HCC.

Half of the new lesions detected by dual-tracer PET/CT were extrahepatic metastases, mainly in bone, whereas the remaining lesions were either new intrahepatic nodules or macrovascular invasion.

The main strength of our study lay in the large number of HCC cases assessed by both 18F-FDG PET/CT and 18F-FCH PET/CT in a European population.

Most previous series assessed only one modality (usually 18F-FDG PET/CT) for tumor staging, primarily in Asian populations, with conflicting results: some studies reported a minimal added value of PET/CT in tumor staging (modifications of tumor staging of less than 2.5% in an Asian study using 18F-FDG PET/CT alone) and prediction of tumor recurrence (18F-FDG PET/CT-positive in fewer than 20% of patients with HCC meeting Milan criteria),9,19 whereas other studies suggested that 18F-FDG PET/CT should be part of HCC staging investigations (18F-FDG PET/CT were positive in 71% of patients with unexplained elevated serum AFP, and extrahepatic metastases were identified in 6% of patients with HCC thought to be limited to the liver).20,21

Moreover, the value of 18F-FCH PET/CT in detecting HCC was assessed either independently of 18F-FDG PET/CT16,17,22 or in combination with 18F-FDG PET/CT in a small series that combined benign liver tumors developing on normal liver and HCC developing on cirrhosis.

Those studies suggested that choline PET/CT has better sensitivity at detecting HCC (up to 78–88%) than 18F-FDG PET/CT.12,14

PARAGRAPH

In our series, we assessed both modalities (18F-FDG PET/CT and 18F-FCH PET/CT) for the detection of HCC in different clinical settings and in a fairly large number of patients (192 cases from 177 patients).

In the setting of HCC staging, dual PET/CT led to stage migration in around 11% of cases, resulting in treatment modification in the same proportion of cases.

Moreover, the same proportion of staging and treatment migration was observed in both pretreated and naive patients.

The proportion of staging migration in BCLC A and BCLC C1 patients was slightly higher with 18F-FDG alone than with 18F-FCH alone.

In contrast, none of the patients classified as BCLC 0 had additional lesions identified by PET/CT, suggesting that PET/CT in BCLC 0 is useless in this setting, although robust conclusions are difficult to reach because of the limited number of patients in this subgroup (n = 8).

Based on our results, we suggest that PET/CT should not be used in BCLC 0, while 18F-FDG alone could be used for staging in BCLC A.

In patients with doubtful lesions based on conventional imaging, we suggest that 18F-FCH should be performed first.

In patients with an unexplained rise in serum AFP, both tracers should be used to identify HCC.

However, these proposals should be validated in a prospective study that includes cost-effectiveness analysis.

PARAGRAPH

There were some limitations to our study.

Although histological analysis is the gold standard for confirming the malignant nature of a lesion, biopsy of new lesions identified by dual PET/CT was available only for a subset of patients: when considering all clinical settings, new lesions were identified with PET/CT in 44 cases, 15 with available biopsies.

Among the remaining 29 cases, 13 corresponded to intrahepatic lesions with typical conventional imaging confirmation during follow-up, which is consistent with diagnostic guidelines for HCC.

In the remaining 16 cases corresponding to extrahepatic locations, some sites were difficult to access (lymph nodes, lung), and performing a biopsy might contribute to significant morbidity.

Consequently, we considered significant progression in size at follow-up imaging for extrahepatic lesions to confirm malignancy.

The median follow-up after PET/CT was 35 months, which is long enough to characterize new lesions identified by PET/CT.

PARAGRAPH

Another limitation was the heterogeneous indications of 18F-FCH and 18F-FDG PET/CT, including HCC staging, pre-transplant evaluation without active HCC, an unexplained rise in serum AFP and doubtful lesions upon conventional imaging.

However, the number of patients with PET/CT performed for staging was still high (n = 122), and the rate of new nodules identified, modification of staging and treatment received in HCC treatment-naïve patients was the same as in patients previously treated for HCC.

When pooling cases in a pre-transplant setting (with or without active HCC on conventional imaging), dual-tracer PET/CT identified new lesions in seven patients, with four out of seven corresponding to macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic lesions, thus excluding patients from transplantation.

In the context of organ shortage, selecting the best candidates for transplantation is crucial, and dual-tracer PET/CT can provide valuable information, excluding patients with otherwise undetectable vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread.

Treatment modifications were observed when HCC moved from early to advanced stages, i.e. from curative to palliative treatment.

Interestingly, within the BCLC C stage, identification of additional lesions led to implementation of specific therapies such as radiotherapy targeting bone metastasis or radioembolization for tumor portal thrombosis.18

Two clinical situations are associated with high numbers of new lesions identified by PET/CT and treatment modification: an unexplained rise in serum AFP and doubtful lesions on conventional imaging.

However, we acknowledge that the limited number of cases in both groups might have caused overestimation of the added value of PET/CT in these specific situations.

In head-to-head comparisons of 18F-FDG PET/CT alone and 18F-FCH PET/CT alone for HCC staging, we did not observe statistical differences in the number of new HCC lesions identified.

However, our study suggests that the combination of 18F-FDG PET/CT and 18F-FCH PET/CT detects more new HCC lesions (4% to 5%) than each modality taken separately since, in some cases, only one modality was able to identify new lesions.

Different grades of tumor differentiation might explain this discrepancy.

Unfortunately, histologic data enabling further investigation of this assumption are missing.

Importantly, 18F-FCH PET/CT seemed particularly valuable when characterization of extrahepatic lesions was not possible based on conventional imaging alone.

PARAGRAPH

With new tumor lesions detected in 17% of cases with 18F-FCH PET/CT compared to conventional imaging, our results might seem disappointing compared to those of Bieze et al., who reported 50% additional lesions and 52% treatment modifications.16

However, we should underline that our study included a larger number of patients (177 patients) compared to Bieze et al. (30 patients), and reported performances of new imaging modalities that frequently decrease when the size of the series increases.16

Moreover, it is important to stress that our study was not specifically designed to assess the sensitivity and specificity of PET/CT for diagnosis of HCC; rather, we sought to test the usefulness of dual-tracer PET/CT for identifying new tumor lesions, refining staging and ultimately modifying the treatment received.

PARAGRAPH

The main limitation of our study remains its retrospective design.

We cannot rule out a selection bias with PET/CT performed in patients at higher risk of additional lesions.

The retrospective design also prevented assessment of the impact of 18F-FDG PET/CT alone and 18F-FCH PET/CT alone compared to dual-tracer PET/CT in terms of treatment modification, since both modalities were concomitantly reviewed in TMB.

Finally, false-positive lesions leading to additional testing are potentially associated with anxiety and discomfort for the patient and additional cost for the institution.

Thus, the cost-effectiveness of adding dual-tracer PET/CT to HCC pre-treatment evaluation should be evaluated.

A well-designed prospective study would be useful to properly address these questions.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, dual-tracer PET/CT with 18F-FDG and 18F-FCH enables detection of lesions not identified by conventional imaging in patients with HCC, leading to tumor stage and treatment modifications.

These results should be further investigated in a multicentric prospective study to confirm the incremental value and cost-effectiveness of dual-tracer PET/CT for HCC staging and treatment allocation.
