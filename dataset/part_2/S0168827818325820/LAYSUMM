TITLE

Serum hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) correlates with covalently closed circular DNA transcriptional activity in chronic hepatitis B patients

PARAGRAPH

Hepatitis B virus causes a chronic infection which develops into severe liver disease and liver cancer.

The viral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is responsible for the persistence of the infection in hepatocytes.

To better manage patient treatment and follow-up, and to develop new antiviral treatments directly targeting the intrahepatic pool of cccDNA, serum surrogate markers reflecting the viral activity in the liver are urgently needed.

In this work, we demonstrate that quantification of hepatitis B core-related antigen in serum correlates with cccDNA amount and activity and could be used to monitor disease progression.
