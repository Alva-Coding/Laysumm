TITLE

Loss of Fbxw7 synergizes with activated Akt signaling to promote c-Myc dependent cholangiocarcinogenesis

PARAGRAPH

There is mounting evidence that FBXW7 functions as a tumor suppressor in many cancer types, including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, through its ability to promote the degradation of numerous oncoproteins.

Herein, we have shown that the low expression of FBXW7 is ubiquitous in human cholangiocarcinoma specimens.

This low expression is correlated with increased c-MYC activity, leading to tumorigenesis.

Our findings suggest that targeting c-MYC might be an effective treatment for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
