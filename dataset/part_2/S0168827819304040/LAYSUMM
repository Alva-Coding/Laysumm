TITLE

Crosstalk between adipose tissue insulin resistance and liver macrophages in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

PARAGRAPH

The pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH) is likely due to the interaction between a deranged metabolic milieu and local mediators of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in the insulin resistant state.

This study provides in vivo support for a possible link between deranged metabolism in the adipose tissue and activation of hepatic macrophages in patients with NAFLD, most likely in response to free fatty acid overflow and independent of obesity and diabetes.
