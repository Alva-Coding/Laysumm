ABSTRACT

TITLE

Crosstalk between adipose tissue insulin resistance and liver macrophages in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

PARAGRAPH

The pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH) is likely due to the interaction between a deranged metabolic milieu and local mediators of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis.

We undertook this study to elucidate the interplay between macrophage activation, insulin resistance (IR) in target organs/tissues and hepatic damage.

PARAGRAPH

In 40 non-diabetic patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD we assessed: i) endogenous glucose production (EGP), glucose clearance and indexes of IR in the adipose tissue (Adipo-IR and Lipo-IR) and in the liver (Hep-IR) by tracer infusion ([6,6-2H2]glucose and [2H5]glycerol); ii) macrophage activity (by soluble sCD163) and iii) hepatic expression of CD163 (hCD163).

PARAGRAPH

We found that sCD163 levels paralleled both the plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels and lipolysis from adipose tissue.

Consistently, sCD163 significantly correlated with adipose tissue IR (Adipo-IR: r = 0.32, p = 0.042; Lipo-IR: r = 0.39, p = 0.012).

At multiple regression analysis, sCD163 levels were associated with FFA levels (rp = 0.35, p = 0.026).

In vitro exposure of human monocyte-derived macrophages to palmitate enhanced sCD163 secretion.

Conversely, sCD163 did not correlate with EGP or with Hep-IR.

In the liver, hCD163 positively correlated with sCD163 (r = 0.58, p = 0.007) and the degree of steatosis (r = 0.34, p = 0.048), but not with EGP or Hep-IR (r = âˆ’0.27 and r = 0.11, respectively, p >0.10, both).

PARAGRAPH

Our findings suggest a link between deranged metabolism in the adipose tissue and activation of hepatic macrophages in patients with NAFLD, possibly in response to FFA overflow and independent of obesity and diabetes.

Conversely, our findings do not support a link between activated hepatic macrophages and glucose metabolism (EGP or Hep-IR).

The relationship between adipose tissue IR and hepatic macrophages should be considered to define therapeutic targets for NAFLD.
