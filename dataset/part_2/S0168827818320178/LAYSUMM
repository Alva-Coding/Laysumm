TITLE

Lysyl oxidase-like protein 2 (LOXL2) modulates barrier function in cholangiocytes in cholestasis

PARAGRAPH

In this study, we investigate the role of lysyl oxidase-like protein 2 (LOXL2), an enzyme pivotal in the development of organ fibrosis, in the pathogenesis of cholangiopathies (diseases of bile ducts), such as primary sclerosing cholangitis.

We found LOXL2 to be expressed in association with bile duct epithelial injury and uncovered mechanisms for its upregulation and the subsequent effects in vitro and in vivo.

Our findings support testing of anti-LOXL2 treatment strategies for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.
