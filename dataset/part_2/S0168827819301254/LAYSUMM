TITLE

Deriving the optimal limit of detection for an HCV point-of-care test for viraemic infection: Analysis of a global dataset

PARAGRAPH

We created and analysed a dataset from 12 countries with 66,640 participants with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.

We determined that about 97% of those with viraemic infection had 1,300 IU/ml or more of circulating virus at the time of diagnosis.

While current diagnostic tests can detect as little as 12 IU/ml of virus, our findings suggest that increasing the level of detection closer to 1,300 IU/ml would maintain good test accuracy and will likely enable development of more affordable portable tests for use in low- and middle-income countries.
