TITLE

Natural history of histologically proven alcohol-related liver disease: A systematic review

PARAGRAPH

Knowledge of the natural history of a disease allows clinicians and patients to understand the risks that are associated with a medical condition.

In this study we systematically gathered all the published data regarding the natural history of alcohol-related liver disease in people who had a liver biopsy.

We used this data to define the prevalence of the disease, the annual risk of progression to cirrhosis and the annual risk of death at each stage of the disease.
