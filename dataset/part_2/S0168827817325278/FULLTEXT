TITLE

Association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis: An observational cohort study

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent liver disease in the general population, affecting up to 30% of the adult population in the United States and Europe.1,2

NAFLD is also considered as a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, with insulin resistance a common pathophysiology.3,4

The presence of NAFLD has been known to be associated with an increased prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular disease, independently of other well-known cardiovascular risk factors.5–9

However, there are limited data regarding the association between NAFLD and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in asymptomatic individuals.

Recently, with the advent of multidetector row computed tomography, coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) has proven to be effective in providing a comprehensive evaluation of coronary atherosclerosis, including lesion location, severity, and plaque characteristics.10

A recent meta-analysis with CCTA showed that the specific characteristics of atherosclerotic plaques determined the different risk of future cardiovascular events.11

Therefore, this study sought to evaluate the relationship between NAFLD and characteristics of atherosclerotic plaques through a large cohort of asymptomatic Korean individuals who voluntarily underwent CCTA for early detection of coronary artery disease (CAD).

Patients and methods

SECTION

Study population

PARAGRAPH

From January 2007 to December 2011, 9,249 consecutive South Korean individuals aged ≥20 years who had undergone self-referred CCTA evaluation and abdominal ultrasonography as part of a general health examination at the Health Screening and Promotion Center in the Asan Medical Center were enrolled in the study.

Among these, 7,109 (76.9%) agreed to participate in this study.

Possible risks associated with CCTA were explained, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant.

Exclusion criteria included subjects with i) a previous history of a significant alcohol intake with ≥210 g/week in males and 140 g/week in females;12,13 ii) a previous history of angina or myocardial infarction; iii) abnormal resting electrocardiography results, i.e., pathological Q waves, ischemic ST segments or T-wave changes, or left bundle-branch blocks; iv) insufficient medical records; v) structural heart disease; vi) a previous history of open-heart surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention; vii) a previous cardiac procedure; or viii) renal insufficiency (creatinine >1.5 mg/dl).

Finally, 5,121 subjects were enrolled (Fig. 1).

The study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board of the Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.

SECTION

Clinical and laboratory measurements

PARAGRAPH

Basic demographic data of the study participants were acquired from a database maintained by the Health Screening and Promotion Center at the Asan Medical Center.

Any medical history, including angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, structural heart disease, open-heart surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention, previous cardiac procedures, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking status, was taken from the responses in the systemized self-report questionnaire issued prior to the general health examination.14

PARAGRAPH

Height and weight were obtained with subjects wearing light clothing and no shoes.

The body mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (kg/m2).

Waist circumference (cm) was measured mid-way between the lower costal margin and iliac crest at the end of a normal expiration of breath by a well-trained nurse.

Blood pressure was measured on the right arm after a ≥5 min rest using an automatic manometer and an appropriate cuff size.

After overnight fasting, early morning blood samples were drawn from the antecubital vein into vacuum tubes and subsequently analyzed in the central certified laboratory of the Asan Medical Center.

The concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), fasting plasma glucose, creatinine, fasting total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured.15

PARAGRAPH

Obesity was defined as a body mass index ≥25 kg/m2.16

Diabetes mellitus was defined as a fasting plasma glucose concentration ≥126 mg/dl, or a self-reported history of diabetes mellitus, and/or treatment by dietary modification, or use of anti-diabetic medication.

Hypertension was defined as blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg or a self-reported history of hypertension and/or use of anti-hypertensive medication.

Hyperlipidemia was defined as total cholesterol ≥240 mg/dl or use of an anti-hyperlipidemic treatment.

A family history of CAD was defined as having a first-degree relative of any age with CAD on the self-report questionnaire.14

PARAGRAPH

To evaluate the status of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, the fatty liver index (FLI) and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) were calculated and used in the present study.

The cut-off values to rule out fatty liver (FLI <30) and advanced hepatic fibrosis (NFS <−1.455) were adapted as described elsewhere.17,18

SECTION

CCTA image acquisition and analysis

PARAGRAPH

CCTA was conducted using either single-source 64-slice CT (LightSpeed VCT, GE, Milwaukee, WI, USA) or dual-source CT (Somatom Definition, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany).

A standard scanning protocol was used, as previously described.10

All CCTA scans were analyzed using a dedicated workstation (Advantage Workstation, GE; or Volume Wizard, Siemens) by experienced cardiovascular radiologists (DHY, JWK, and THL).

According to the guidelines of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography, a 16-segment coronary artery tree model was used.

A coronary artery calcium (CAC) score was measured and categorized by scores of 0, 1to 10, 11 to 100, 101 to 400, and >400.

Coronary artery calcification is defined as CAC >10.19,20

Plaques containing calcified tissue involving more than 50% of the plaque area (density >130 HU) were classified as calcified, plaques with <50% calcium were classified as mixed, and plaques without calcium were classified as non-calcified lesions.

The contrast-enhanced portion of the coronary lumen was semi-automatically traced at the site of maximal stenosis and compared with the mean value of the proximal and distal reference sites.

Stenosis ≥50% was defined as significant.10

SECTION

Ultrasonography examination

PARAGRAPH

Fatty liver was determined by ultrasonography examination.

The ultrasonographic evaluation of hepatic steatosis, using a Sequoia 512 scanner (Acuson, Mountain View, CA) with a 4.0 MHz convex probe, typically consists of a qualitative visual assessment of hepatic echogenicity, measurements of the difference between the liver and kidneys in echo amplitude, evaluation of echo penetration into the deep portion of the liver, and determination of the clarity of blood vessel structures in the liver.21

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Categorical variables are expressed as frequencies with percentages and continuous variables as the mean and standard deviation.

Comparisons were performed using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and the unpaired Student’s t test for numerical variables, as appropriate.

Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using a logistic regression model to analyze the association between NAFLD and coronary atherosclerotic plaques or significant coronary artery stenosis on CCTA.

Covariates in the multivariable model, which were chosen according to their clinical importance as well as statistical significance, included age, sex, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, current smoking, a family history of CAD, and hs-CRP.

All reported p values are two-sided, and p <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Data manipulation and statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (Version 18, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).

Results

SECTION

Baseline characteristics

PARAGRAPH

The mean age of the study population was 53.8 ± 7.6 years, and 3,487 (68.1%) participants were male.

Of the study participants, 1,979 (38.6%) had ultrasonography-diagnosed NAFLD.

The baseline characteristics of study participants with and without NAFLD are shown (Table 1).

Individuals with NAFLD had higher BMI and waist circumference, higher rates of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and current smoking, higher levels of AST, ALT, GGT, and FLI than those without NAFLD.

In contrast, there was no significant difference in NFS values between the two groups.

SECTION

CCTA findings

PARAGRAPH

The CCTA findings according to the presence of NAFLD are shown (Table 2).

The mean CAC score of the study participants was 38.2 ± 136.4.

Individuals with NAFLD had higher CAC scores than normal individuals (p <0.001).

Atherosclerotic plaques were found in 2,084 (40.7%) participants.

Calcified, non-calcified, and mixed plaques were detected in 1,372 (26.8%), 940 (18.4%), and 451 (8.8%) individuals, respectively.

The prevalence of any atherosclerotic, calcified, non-calcified, or mixed plaque was significantly higher in individuals with NAFLD (p for all <0.001).

Of the study participants, 405 (7.9%) had significant coronary artery stenosis (≥50% diameter stenosis) in at least one coronary artery on CCTA.

Significant stenosis in the left main, left anterior descending, left circumflex artery, and right coronary arteries was observed in 20 (0.4%), 265 (5.2%), 136 (2.7%) and 120 (2.3%) participants, respectively.

In addition, individuals with NAFLD had more significant coronary artery stenosis than those without NAFLD (p <0.001).

SECTION

Association between NAFLD and subclinical atherosclerosis

PARAGRAPH

The association between NAFLD and subclinical atherosclerosis is shown (Table 3).

On univariate analysis, NAFLD was significantly associated with coronary artery calcification (defined as CAC score >10) and any atherosclerotic, calcified, non-calcified, and mixed plaques.

NAFLD also showed a strong association with significant coronary artery stenosis (p for all <0.001).

However, after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors (age, sex, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, current smoking, family history of CAD, and hs-CRP), logistic regression analysis revealed that NAFLD was not associated with either coronary artery calcification (1.07; 95% CI 0.92–1.25; p = 0.375), calcified plaque (1.03, 95% CI 0.89–1.20; p = 0.673), or mixed plaque (1.15, 95% CI 0.93–1.42; p = 0.214).

Conversely, there was a significant association between NAFLD and any atherosclerotic plaque (1.18, 95% CI 1.03–1.35; p = 0.016), non-calcified plaque (1.27, 95% CI 1.08–1.48; p = 0.003), and significant coronary artery stenosis (1.28, 95% CI 1.02–1.61; p = 0.030).

PARAGRAPH

The association of FLI and NFS with subclinical atherosclerosis on CCTA is shown (Table 4).

On univariate analysis, FLI ≥30 and NFS ≥−1.455 were significantly associated with coronary artery calcification, any atherosclerotic, calcified, non-calcified, mixed plaques and significant coronary artery stenosis (p for all <0.001).

After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, there was significant association of FLI ≥30 with non-calcified plaque (1.37, 95% CI 1.14–1.65; p = 0.001) and NFS ≥−1.455 with non-calcified plaque (1.20, 95% CI 1.08–1.42; p = 0.030).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The main finding of the present study was that NAFLD was an independent predictor of non-calcified plaque on CCTA in asymptomatic individuals after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors.

However, NAFLD showed no association with either calcified or mixed plaque.

PARAGRAPH

NAFLD is considered a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, which may increase the risk of atherosclerosis via common and separate mechanisms.3,4

The association between NAFLD and atherosclerosis has been investigated in previous studies using the CAC score, which reflects the total coronary atherosclerotic burden.

However, inconsistent results have been reported.7–9,22,23

In addition, previous studies have reported that the absence of coronary calcification does not exclude the presence of significant CAD.24,25

Based on more comprehensive information regarding coronary atherosclerosis by CCTA,10 a recent study investigated the association between NAFLD and coronary atherosclerotic plaque on CCTA.26

However, it did not focus on asymptomatic individuals with NAFLD.

Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the influence of NAFLD on the risk of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis on CCTA.

PARAGRAPH

In the present study, 1,979 (38.6%) had ultrasonography-diagnosed NAFLD, with a prevalence ranging from 40.1 to 44.1%, which is consistent with the findings of earlier observational studies.8,9

Individuals with NAFLD had a higher prevalence of traditional risk factors associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

After adjustment for clinical and laboratory variables, the incidence of calcified or mixed plaques did not differ between individuals with and without NAFLD.

On the contrary, only non-calcified plaque was independently associated with NAFLD.

Previous studies have demonstrated an association between non-calcified plaque and high-risk patients, such as those with diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, a family history of CAD, smoking history, and higher levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or hs-CRP.15,27,28

A recent meta-analysis also revealed that calcified plaques are more resistant to undergoing changes in size while non-calcified plaques might have an increased tendency to progress and lead to a greater risk of acute coronary syndrome events.11

Furthermore, the cardiac risk of non-calcified plaque has been reported in several studies with various patient groups.29–32

These studies showed that non-calcified plaques are more frequently found in patients with acute coronary syndrome.30,32

A follow-up study using CCTA also demonstrated that non-calcified plaques were prospectively related to the culprit lesions in patients with acute coronary syndrome.29

Even in asymptomatic individuals, non-calcified plaques were associated with potential cardiac risk.31

Therefore, considering these findings and those of the present study, the mechanism of the development of unpredictable cardiac events in individuals with NAFLD may be linked, in part, to a higher risk of plaque rupture and the vulnerability of non-calcified plaques.

PARAGRAPH

Similarly, FLI, a simple clinical predictor of hepatic steatosis,17 showed an independent association with non-calcified plaques in multivariate analysis, which support the key finding of our study.

Interestingly, NFS, a noninvasive method that identifies liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD,18 also showed an independent association with non-calcified plaques.

Higher NFS levels would indicate advanced stages of NAFLD which may have a more adverse effect on the cardiovascular system.33

However, in our study, NFS values did not differ according to NAFLD.

Considering a general population-based design of this study, the proportion of individuals with NAFLD and advanced fibrosis might be insufficient to show differences in NFS values compared to subjects without NAFLD.

PARAGRAPH

A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that NAFLD is associated with an increased risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events.6

The present study provides some insights into the mechanisms of the poorer cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with NAFLD.

Our data and those of previous studies suggest that non-calcified plaques may be associated with sudden and unexpected cardiac events in asymptomatic individuals with NAFLD.

Consequently, these findings highlight the importance of preventive efforts to avoid cardiovascular events in asymptomatic individuals with NAFLD, for whom care should focus on early identification, personalized lifestyle modification, and appropriate medical treatments for NAFLD.

PARAGRAPH

Our study has several limitations.

Firstly, the present study was performed at a single center, and since all study participants had voluntarily visited the hospital for a general health examination, there is a potential for selection bias.

Secondly, we defined the presence of NAFLD based on ultrasonographic findings, which may have led to incorrect diagnoses.34

Thirdly, calcified plaques and higher CAC scores may have led to an overestimation of significant coronary artery stenosis.

Fourthly, our study participants were exclusively Korean, which means that the applicability of our findings to other ethnic groups may be limited.

Fifthly, since clinical follow-up data was limited, our study was insufficient to evaluate the association between NAFLD or subclinical coronary atherosclerosis and cardiac events.

Therefore, our findings need to be confirmed in other prospective studies with larger populations and long-term clinical follow-up.

Finally, CCTA has potential drawbacks, including radiation hazards, use of contrast, and higher cost.

Therefore, although this study enrolled only volunteers, the use of CCTA in asymptomatic individuals with NAFLD cannot be justified.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, in this large cross-sectional study of asymptomatic individuals undergoing CCTA, NAFLD was associated with non-calcified plaque, suggesting an increased risk of cardiovascular events.

These findings need to be further investigated and validated in additional studies.
