TITLE

Association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis: An observational cohort study

PARAGRAPH

In asymptomatic individuals, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was an independent risk factor for non-calcified plaque, which has been known as a vulnerable plaque associated with sudden and unexpected cardiac events.

Therefore, appropriate medical therapy for NAFLD was required to reduce future cardiac events.
