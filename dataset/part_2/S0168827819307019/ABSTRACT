ABSTRACT

TITLE

Evolution of eGFR in chronic HCV patients receiving sofosbuvir-based or sofosbuvir-free direct acting antivirals

PARAGRAPH

Data regarding the nephrotoxicity of sofosbuvir (SOF) remain controversial.

We compared the changes of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection receiving SOF-based or SOF-free direct acting antivirals (DAAs).

PARAGRAPH

481 patients with compensated liver diseases and eGFR â‰¥ 30 mL/min/1.73m2 receiving SOF-based (n = 308) or SOF-free (n = 173) DAAs for 12 weeks were prospectively enrolled.

The eGFR was assessed from baseline to off-therapy week 24 by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation.

The eGFR evolutions between regimens were compared by generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM).

Multivariate analysis was performed for factors affecting eGFR evolution.

PARAGRAPH

Patients receiving SOF-based DAAs had a significant on-treatment eGFR decline (adjusted slope coefficient difference: -1.24 mL/min/1.73m2/month [95% CI: -1.35 to -1.13]; p < 0.001) and a significant off-therapy eGFR improvement (adjusted slope coefficient difference: 0.14 mL/min/1.73m2/month [95% CI: 0.08 to 0.21]; p = 0.004) than patients receiving SOF-free DAAs.

Multivariate analysis showed age per 1-year increase (adjusted slope coefficient difference: -0.05 mL/min/1.73m2/month [95% CI: -0.05 to -0.04]; p < 0.001), SOF-based DAAs (adjusted slope coefficient difference: -0.33 mL/min/1.73m2/month [95% CI: -0.49 to -0.17]; p < 0.001), and CKD stage (adjusted slope coefficient difference: -1.44 mL/min/1.73m2/month [95% CI: -1.58 to -1.30] and -3.59 mL/min/1.73m2/month [95% CI: -3.88 to -3.30] for stage 3 and stage 2 vs. stage 1; p < 0.001) were independent factors affecting eGFR evolution from baseline to SVR24.

PARAGRAPH

Patients receiving SOF-based DAAs have a quadratic trend with on-treatment worsening and off-therapy improving eGFR.

Increasing age, SOF-based DAAs, and more advanced CKD stages are independently associated with eGFR decline in HCV patients receiving DAAs.
