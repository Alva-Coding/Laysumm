TITLE

Genetic studies of abdominal MRI data identify genes regulating hepcidin as major determinants of liver iron concentration

PARAGRAPH

Excess liver iron content is common and is associated with liver diseases and metabolic diseases including diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.

We identified 3 genetic variants that are linked to an increased risk of developing higher liver iron content.

We show that the same genetic variants are linked to higher risk of many diseases, but they may also be associated with some health advantages.

Finally, we use genetic variants associated with waist-to-hip ratio as a tool to show that central obesity is causally associated with increased liver iron content.
