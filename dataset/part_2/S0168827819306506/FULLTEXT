TITLE

Insulin sensitizer MSDC-0602K in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb study

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are hepatic manifestations of metabolic syndrome and are increasing globally.1,2

Patients with NAFLD/NASH often present with either type 2 diabetes (T2D) or have insulin resistance and elevated fasting insulin levels, which are all established precursors for the development of diabetes and for adverse macrovascular sequalae.3–5

NASH, T2D, and insulin resistance are thought to be growing in incidence and severity because of the increased availability of nutrients and consequent overnutrition.2

PARAGRAPH

First-generation insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones (TZDs) were developed more than 30 years ago and are still in use to treat T2D.

These compounds are known as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) agonists because they directly bind to and activate the PPARγ nuclear hormone receptor.6

TZDs have been shown to improve insulin resistance and glucose metabolism resulting in lower glucose concentrations, and to reduce the risk of downstream cardiovascular (CV) outcomes.7,8

However, TZDs are associated with significant side effects including edema, bone fractures mediated by PPARγ and hypoglycemia.

A second target for the insulin-sensitizing TZDs – the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) – was recently identified.9

The insulin-sensitizing TZDs all slow the entry of pyruvate, the end product of cytosolic glucose metabolism, into the mitochondria, where much of cellular metabolism is coordinated.10

The potential routes by which compounds, including the earlier TZDs such as pioglitazone, can initiate insulin-sensitizing pharmacology by slowing the entry of pyruvate into the mitochondria, have been reviewed elsewhere.11,12

Briefly, changing the entry of pyruvate changes the mitochondrial metabolism of other nutrients, altering multiple inputs of metabolism, especially in the face of overnutrition, to downstream signals including mTOR and transcriptional networks that control many cellular functions including sensitivity to insulin and growth factors.11,12

Since this target can be addressed without directly activating nuclear receptors, MPC agonism may offer an advantageous treatment modality.11,12

Moreover, MSDC-0602K was designed to minimize binding to PPARγ, while still producing insulin-sensitizing pharmacology in diabetic13 and NASH animal models.14

PARAGRAPH

MSDC-0602K is a second-generation TZD designed to minimize direct binding to PPARγ, but to retain the ability to modulate the MPC.15,16

In the EMMINENCE study, the effects of MSDC-0602K on liver histology and liver and glucose metabolism markers were tested in patients with NASH diagnosed by liver biopsy, with and without T2D.

The current study’s aim was to compare the preliminary safety and efficacy of 52 weeks’ treatment with 3 daily oral doses of MSDC-0602K versus placebo on changes in liver histology, as well as on markers of glucose control, liver injury, apoptosis and fibrosis in a population of patients with biopsy-proven NASH, with and without T2D.

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Study design

PARAGRAPH

EMMINENCE was a randomized, double-blind evaluation of 3 oral daily doses of MSDC-0602K (62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg) or placebo given for 12 months to adult patients with biopsy-proven NASH, with fibrosis and without cirrhosis.

The primary efficacy endpoint was assessed at 12 months.

Clinic visits were conducted at baseline, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, followed 2 weeks later by a safety visit.

An interim analysis of safety and non-histological, exploratory efficacy endpoints were conducted when 6-month data were available for 328 patients.

Interim results were provided only as summary statistics to avoid any unmasking of the study team or sponsor.

PARAGRAPH

Local principal investigators evaluated patients at each visit and determined the adjustment of concomitant anti-diabetes medications and ancillary therapeutics based on their examinations.

They remained masked to the treatment assignment throughout the study.

Safety was overseen by the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor.

PARAGRAPH

The study was conducted in accordance with ICH GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements.

Patients provided written informed consent prior to study participation.

The protocol and consent forms were approved by relevant institutional review boards.

The study is listed on clintrials.gov as NCT0278444.

SECTION

Participants

PARAGRAPH

Eligible patients were at least 18 years old with NASH (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score [NAS] ≥4; score ≥1 in each component [steatosis, ballooning, inflammation]) with F1 to F3 fibrosis on liver biopsy taken between 9 months prior to screening and randomization according to a central hepatopathologist’s reading.

Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are given in Table S1.

SECTION

Randomization and masking

PARAGRAPH

A central randomization scheme with equal allocation across the 4 groups, in blocks of 4 within strata defined by the presence of T2D (Yes/No), use of Vitamin E ≥400 IU (Yes/No), and fibrosis score (F1 or F2/F3) was generated by an unblinded statistician.

Medication was supplied as bottles of masked capsules.

Eligible patients were randomized according to the central scheme through a web-based platform.

Patients, investigators, the sponsor and all other parties except a sequestered statistical consultant were masked to treatment assignment throughout the conduct of the study and a formal statistical analysis plan was finalized before the statistical consultant unmasked any other parties.

SECTION

Procedures

PARAGRAPH

Patients had a liver biopsy at screening/baseline and at 12 months.

If no usable liver biopsy was available within 9 months prior to screening, a percutaneous liver biopsy was performed in patients with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥20 U/L, FibroScan controlled attenuation parameter score ≥270 db/m and liver stiffness measurement ≥8.5 kPa.

Digitized slides were read by a single expert hepatopathologist according to NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN) criteria.17

Baseline biopsies were read first for study qualification and a second time mixed randomly among 12-month biopsies in order to remove the inherent bias of the qualifying read from treatment comparisons.

PARAGRAPH

Physical examinations were conducted at each study visit, including assessment of peripheral edema, graded from 1+ to 4+ if present.

Fasting blood samples for routine central laboratory analyses were collected at each visit, and frozen samples collected at selected visits for biomarker assays.

SECTION

Outcomes

PARAGRAPH

The primary efficacy endpoint was hepatic histological improvement in NAS defined as ≥2-point NAS decrease with a ≥1-point reduction in either ballooning or lobular inflammation and no increase in fibrosis stage at 12 months.

PARAGRAPH

Secondary efficacy endpoints included i) NASH resolution defined as hepatocellular ballooning score of 0 and lobular inflammation score of 0–1 with no increase in fibrosis stage at 12 months, ii) fibrosis improvement defined as ≥1-stage decrease in fibrosis with no worsening of lobular inflammation or hepatocellular ballooning, iii) change from baseline in NAS and each 1 of its components (steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning) at 12 months, and iv) change from baseline in fibrosis score at 12 months.

PARAGRAPH

Exploratory efficacy endpoints included shifts in the central hepatopathologist’s NASH diagnosis confirmation, and changes from baseline to 12 months in markers of glycemic control and insulin sensitivity, liver injury, and apoptosis and liver fibrosis.

PARAGRAPH

Safety was evaluated by adverse event incidence, and changes in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, and electrocardiogram parameters.

Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina hospitalization, hospital admission for heart failure (HF), or non-fatal ischemic stroke; liver events including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal hemorrhage, hepatocellular carcinoma, or liver transplant; and severe hypoglycemia were adjudicated by an independent physician.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Each of the 3 MSDC-0602K dose groups was compared to the placebo group at the 2-sided 0.05 significance level.

It was estimated that 85 patients per arm would provide approximately 80% power to detect a difference in response rates of 39.5% in any MSDC-0602K dose group versus 20% in the placebo group.

As this was a phase IIb dose-ranging study, no multiplicity adjustment was employed.

PARAGRAPH

Treated patients were included for analysis in their randomly assigned treatment groups.

Participation of sites with serious GCP or quality concerns was terminated, and their data excluded from the analyses.

Post-baseline measures were included up until 14 days after the last study drug dose.

No errors in treatment assignment occurred.

PARAGRAPH

The central hepatopathologist’s re-read of baseline biopsies was used as baseline.

Patients who no longer qualified on re-read were included in the analyses.

Each active treatment group was compared to placebo with respect to the primary and secondary histopathologic endpoints using logistic regression including adjustment for randomization strata (T2D, baseline fibrosis F1 vs. F2/F3), and ordinal baseline NAS.

Stratification-adjusted risk differences18,19 are also presented.

The primary analyses included only observed data; sensitivity analyses included multiply imputed missing follow-up, and missing follow-up considered as non-response.

PARAGRAPH

Each active dose was compared to placebo for changes in NASH CRN scores, using analysis of covariance with adjustment for age, sex, T2D, vitamin E ≥400 IU, baseline fibrosis F1 versus F2/F3, and the baseline value.

Changes in laboratory markers from baseline to 6 months and to 12 months were analyzed similarly.

SECTION

Post hoc analyses

PARAGRAPH

We examined an additional endpoint of NASH resolution defined as above, but with a ≥2-point NAS reduction.

In this analysis, similar to methodology used in other studies, we used the qualifying read of the screening biopsy as baseline and considered missing follow-up as non-response for this analysis, because of the large number (24.5%) of patients who were deemed upon re-read of the screening biopsy not to have met histological inclusion criteria, or who discontinued early – both with large imbalances, which were greater in the placebo arm.

PARAGRAPH

The proportion of patients for whom the pathologist’s NASH diagnosis shifted from confirmed at baseline (re-read) to not confirmed at month 12 was compared between each active dose and placebo, using logistic regression.

PARAGRAPH

Analyses examining results in patients with more severe liver disease (AST >27 U/L) and higher baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c >6.0% or >7.0%) were conducted.

The AST threshold was selected based on evidence suggesting this value may differentiate NASH in patients at risk,20 and was also the first quartile baseline value in EMMINENCE.

HbA1c >6% is an accepted threshold for inclusion into many T2D studies and was the median baseline value in EMMINENCE; HbA1c >7% is a value accepted as the threshold for poorly controlled T2D.

Tests of whether the effects of the combined 125 mg and 250 mg MSDC-0602K doses versus placebo differed in patients in the subgroup (interaction tests) were constructed by contrasting the least square mean treatment differences over all time points in the 2 groups for changes in laboratory markers and through a treatment-by-subgroup interaction term in the logistic regression model for binary endpoints.

PARAGRAPH

Because similar effects on liver injury and glycemic control were observed with the 2 highest MSDC-0602K doses (125 mg and 250 mg), the 125 mg and 250 mg MSDC-0602K dose groups were combined and compared with placebo for key primary, secondary and exploratory endpoints.

PARAGRAPH

Analyses were conducted to gauge MSDC-0602K effects across multiple biomarkers of apoptosis and liver fibrosis (AST-platelet ratio index [APRI], FIB-4, FibroTest, ELF™, and CK-18).

Changes in each biomarker were transformed to z-scores by subtracting from each patient’s value the overall mean and dividing by the overall standard deviation.21

Groups were compared with respect to the average of a patient’s z-scores over the biomarkers at 6 months and at 12 months, comparing the combined 125 mg and 250 mg doses against placebo, using Kruskal-Wallis tests.

Because APRI and FIB-4 are highly correlated, being derived from 2 common variables (AST and platelet count), the average z-score excluding APRI was also examined.

PARAGRAPH

Finally, because MSDC-0602K treatment was associated with weight gain, as is expected with insulin sensitizers and insulin itself, we used linear regression to compare the associations of changes in insulin, HbA1c and AST with changes in weight between placebo-treated and MSDC-0602K-treated patients.

PARAGRAPH

SAS® software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used for analyses.

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

Between September 2016 and May 2018, 1,090 patients were screened and 402 randomized in 57 US centers; all patients were treated with study medication.

Ten randomized patients in 5 prematurely terminated centers were excluded before the interim analysis due to major quality concerns.

The participant flow is presented in Fig. 1.

PARAGRAPH

Baseline characteristics and concomitant therapies in the patients enrolled in the study were generally well balanced between the groups (Table 1).

Mean age was 56.1 ± 10.7 years.

Average weight was 99.7 ± 19.9 kg; average BMI was 35.2 ± 5.8; 52.3% had T2D, 4.8% known coronary artery disease, 36.5% hyperlipidemia and 8.4% peripheral edema at baseline.

On qualifying biopsy, mean NAS was 5.3 ± 1.02 points and 61.5% had fibrosis F2 or F3.

Twelve patients were included based on biopsies performed >6 but <9 months before screening.

At baseline, mean AST was 44.2 ± 22.58 U/L, and HbA1c was 6.38 ± 1.042%.

At inclusion, about half (49.7%) the patients and 90.2% of diabetic patients received anti-diabetes therapy; most of whom (65.4% of diabetics) were treated with metformin.

Almost half (48.7%) the patients received lipid-modifying agents.

PARAGRAPH

Upon re-read of the screening biopsies, the central hepatopathologist deemed that 24.5% of qualified patients based on initial read did not meet the study’s histopathological eligibility criteria (23.4%, 22.2%, 28.6% and 23.8% in the placebo, 62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg MSDC-0602K groups, respectively).

Patients who were found not to qualify per the re-read biopsy were included in all analyses presented below, as pre-specified in the study’s statistical analysis plan.

Furthermore, a NASH diagnosis at baseline was not confirmed on re-read in 12.6% of patients: 18.1%, 10.1%, 13.5% and 9% of patients in the placebo, 62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg MSDC-0602K groups, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

Although results are suggestive of a histologic dose–response, no statistically significant difference between any MSDC-0602K dose and placebo with respect to primary and secondary binary histologic endpoints was observed (Table 2).

The primary endpoint, NAS improvement, occurred in 29.7%, 29.8%, 32.9%, and 39.5% of patients in the placebo, 62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg MSDC-0602K groups, respectively.

Results were similar for sensitivity analyses imputing for missing follow-ups.

The adjusted mean difference in NAS change to 12 months was significantly greater in the MSDC-0602K 125 mg (−0.6 points) and 250 mg (−0.5 points) groups than in placebo, with a significantly greater change in steatosis in the 250 mg dose group than in placebo (−0.3 points).

Twelve-month fibrosis stage changes did not differ significantly between placebo and any active dose group.

A confirmed NASH diagnosis at baseline (re-read) was not confirmed at 12 months in 20.3%, 32.1%, 26.5%, and 30.2% of patients in placebo, 62.5 mg, 125 mg, and 250 mg MSDC-0602K groups, respectively, with no significant differences from placebo (Table 2).

A dose–response was observed for NASH resolution, with a ≥2-point NAS reduction when the qualifying read of the screening biopsy was used as baseline and missing follow-ups were considered non-responders; compared to placebo, the adjusted odds ratio of the 2 highest doses of MSDC-0602K combined (125 mg and 250 mg) was 2.03 (95% CI 1.03–4.00).

PARAGRAPH

Fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, fasting plasma insulin, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR – an index of insulin sensitivity derived from insulin and glucose values) all increased (worsened) in patients randomized to placebo (Fig. 2); in contrast, these parameters decreased in a dose-dependent fashion in actively treated patients, plateauing at the 2 highest doses.

Adjusted placebo-corrected 6-month mean decreases in HbA1c were −0.15%, −0.36%, and −0.29% in the 62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg groups, respectively.

Adjusted mean 12-month increases in adiponectin were 1,441 ng/ml, 2,382 ng/ml (p = 0.119 vs. placebo), 3,544 ng/ml (p = 0.001) and 5,951 (p <0.001) ng/ml in the placebo, 62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg MSDC-0602K groups, respectively.

In patients with poorly controlled T2D (baseline HbA1c >7%), adjusted mean HbA1c reductions versus placebo at 6 months for the 2 highest doses were −1.01% (95% CI −1.86 to −0.16%) and −0.58% (95% CI −1.35 to 0.20%), respectively (Table S2).

PARAGRAPH

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), AST, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) mean levels changed little in patients randomized to placebo whereas mean levels were persistently reduced in all active dose groups (Fig. 3).

While effects on alkaline phosphatase and GGT suggest a graded dose–response, effects of the MSDC-0602K 125 mg and 250 mg doses on ALT and AST were similar, with adjusted mean 6-month reductions relative to placebo of 12.4 U/L (95% CI −19.3 to −5.5) and 10.5 U/L (95% CI −17.3 to −3.7) for ALT, and 7.9 U/L (95% CI −13.8 to −1.9) and 5.3 U/L (95% CI −11.1 to 0.6) for AST, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

The proportion of patients with baseline ALT levels greater than conservative upper normal limits of 19 and 30 U/L for women and men, respectively, whose levels were normal at 12 months was 6.8%, 10.6% (p = 0.413), 20.8% p = (0.019), and 33.3% (p <0.001) for the placebo, 62.5 mg, 125 mg, and 250 mg groups, respectively, and 27.2% (p = 0.0014) for the combined 125 mg and 250 mg group.

PARAGRAPH

Small 12-month changes in lipid levels that did not vary across treatment groups were observed (Table S3).

There were no substantial changes in C-reactive protein at 12 months: −0.95 mg/L, −2.9 mg/L, −1.1 mg/L and −2.3 mg/L in the placebo, 62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg MSDC-0602K groups, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

Changes in biomarkers of fibrosis and apoptosis observed in MSDC-0602K treated patients at 6 and 12 months are reported in Fig. 4.

These measures were lower in the combined 125 mg and 250 mg MSDC-0602K group versus placebo, with a magnitude of between 0.13 and 0.32 SDs difference at 6 months and somewhat smaller effects at 12 months.

The average effect of the combined highest doses relative to placebo on ELF™, FIB-4, FibroTest, and CK-18 was a reduction of 0.21 (95% CI −0.39 to −0.03) SDs at 6 months and 0.17 (95% CI −0.37 to 0.02) SDs at 12 months.

PARAGRAPH

MSDC-0602K treated patients gained weight relative to placebo.

Unadjusted median weight changes were −0.54 kg, 0.82 kg, 1.10 kg, and 2.28 kg and a weight gain of >3 kg was observed in 9.1%, 21.1%, 33.3% and 43.3% in the placebo, 62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg MSDC-0602K groups, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

Post hoc regression analyses comparing the association of weight gain with metabolic markers, in patients treated with placebo versus the combined 125 mg and 250 mg MSDC-0602K group, suggest that weight gain was not associated with increases in serum insulin in patients treated with MSDC-0602K, while weight changes were associated with worsening of this measure in placebo-treated patients (Fig. S1).

PARAGRAPH

Patients with HbA1c >6% and AST >27 U/L were older (58.0 vs. 54.8 years) and were more likely to have T2D (78.2% vs. 35.2%), diabetic neuropathy (4.5% vs. 0.8%), and hypertension (73.7% vs. 62.3%) than those without (Table S4).

Patients meeting these criteria had higher mean qualifying NAS (5.5 vs. 5.2 points), and were more often treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers (55.8% vs. 39.8%), aspirin (37.8% vs. 25.8%), corticosteroids (7.1% vs. 3.0%), anti-diabetic medications (70.5% vs. 36.0%), and lipid-modifying agents (57.7% vs. 42.8%).

PARAGRAPH

Post hoc analyses suggest that the beneficial effects of MSDC-0602K on liver injury and insulin sensitivity were greater in patients with baseline AST >27 U/L and HbA1c >6% (Fig. 5).

The effect of 125/250 mg MSDC-0602K on changes in ALT (interaction p = 0.024), AST (interaction p = 0.017) and HbA1c (interaction p = 0.007) was different between patients who did or did not meet these criteria – p values were not adjusted for multiplicity.

PARAGRAPH

MSDC-0602K was well tolerated.

Treatment discontinuation rates were 17.0% in the placebo group versus 9.1%, 12.2% and 12.9% in the 62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg MSDC-0602K groups, respectively.

The main reasons for treatment discontinuation were loss to follow-up, which was reported for 4, 4, 1 and 6 patients and withdrawal of consent reported for 7, 2, 3 and 4 patients in the placebo, 62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg MSDC-0602K groups, respectively (Fig. 1).

The frequency of patients suffering 1 or more adverse events was similar across groups (Table 3).

Non-cardiac chest pain, which occurred in 4 patients (2 on the placebo arm, 1 on the 62.5 mg arm, and 1 on the 125 mg arm), was the only SAE that occurred in >2% of patients in any treatment group.

PARAGRAPH

Adjudicated MACE occurred in 1 patient treated with placebo and 2 treated with 125 mg MSDC-0602K; no adjudicated liver events occurred.

Two unrelated deaths were reported, 1 in the placebo arm and 1 in the 125 mg group.

One patient in the 125 mg group had an adjudicated HF hospitalization.

Of note, adverse events of interest based on the profile of TZDs were not observed more commonly in the MSDC-0602K- versus placebo-treated patients.

Cases of edema were reported in 7 placebo-treated patients versus 6, 11 and 7 patients treated with MSDC-0602K 62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg, respectively.

At baseline, ≥1+ edema assessed per protocol was detected in 8.5%, 13.1%, 13.3% and 7.9% of patients in the placebo, 62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg groups, respectively; at 12 months follow-up, ≥1+ edema was detected in 6.5%, 10%, 11.6% and 5.7% of patients in the placebo, 62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg groups, respectively.

Cases of fracture were reported in 2, 6, 1, and 2 patients in the placebo, 62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg groups, respectively.

Fracture requiring hospitalization or surgery occurred in 1 placebo-treated patient versus 1, 1 and 2 patients treated with MSDC-0602K 62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg, respectively.

One adjudicated case of severe hypoglycemia occurred in the 250 mg group.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In the EMMINENCE study, MSDC-0602K, a second-generation insulin sensitizer designed to minimize direct binding to PPARγ but optimized for modulation of the MPC, was administered to patients with liver biopsy-confirmed NASH.

We tested whether this treatment could be dosed to achieve maximum sensitizing pharmacology without the dose-limiting side effects of earlier insulin sensitizers, and whether this pharmacology would benefit the liver as well as improve glycemic control.

The primary and secondary histological endpoints of the study (≥2-point NAS improvement without worsening fibrosis, NASH resolution, and fibrosis reduction by paired liver biopsies) were not met, although some suggestions of dose–response relationships were observed.

On the other hand, the doses of MSDC-0602K tested fully impacted metabolic parameters associated with insulin sensitizer pharmacology, including reductions of fasting glucose, HbA1c, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR without dose-limiting adverse events in this 52-week trial.

The 2 highest doses, 125 mg and 250 mg MSDC-0602K produced similar effects on these parameters.

PARAGRAPH

Current guidance from regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe allows for accelerated market approval for a NASH drug based on improvements in liver histology.22,23

The EMMINENCE study’s primary and secondary outcomes were therefore selected to explore effects on liver histology that might support drug registration, augmented by findings of previous studies showing improvement in histological findings after treatment with TZDs.24

In EMMINENCE, although results for the primary and secondary endpoints were not statistically different from placebo, some improvements in NAS and particularly steatosis were observed in the 125 mg and 250 mg MSDC-0602K groups.

Although no significant effects were observed on fibrosis, ballooning and inflammation, numerical changes in all these parameters were larger in the patients treated with MSDC-0602K.

PARAGRAPH

In analyzing the results of the study, we uncovered that upon re-reading of the baseline biopsies by the same hepatopathologist using the same digital images, 24.5% of the patients were found to not meet the study’s entry criteria upon re-read and 12.6% were deemed to not have NASH.

Moreover, more patients in placebo did not return for the 12-month follow-up biopsy.

Due to this large unexpected finding, we have, in a post hoc analysis, examined the results using the qualifying read as baseline and treating patients who did not return for follow-up biopsy at 12 months as non-responders.

In order to reduce the placebo response rate, a more stringent definition of NASH resolution (ballooning score of 0 and an inflammation score of 0 or 1, no worsening of fibrosis) including the requirement of a 2-point NAS reduction was tested post hoc.

Of the 199 patients treated with the 2 highest doses of MSDC-0602K, 24.6% met this post hoc endpoint compared to 13.8% of the 94 patients treated with placebo, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.03 (95% CI 1.03–4.0).

Hence, issues with interpretation of liver biopsy for NASH observed in the current study may have had an impact on the study results and should be carefully considered in future NASH research, as liver biopsy interpretation for NASH is both an entry criterion and main outcome measure in all pivotal NASH studies.

PARAGRAPH

Consistent trends in improvement of liver injury (AST, ALT, GGT and alkaline phosphatase) and liver fibrosis markers were observed with MSDC-0602K treatment.

Most of these effects displayed a dose–response with 125 mg and 250 mg doses showing mostly equivalent effects.

Taken together, results suggest that MSDC-0602K may have a beneficial effect on liver injury in patients with NASH.

Importantly, these effects are amplified in patients with higher baseline AST (>27 U/L) and HbA1c (>6%), suggesting that MSDC-0602K’s effect is more pronounced in patients with T2D and more significant liver injury.

MSDC-0602K had beneficial effects on glucose metabolism markers, demonstrating dose-dependent improvements in glucose, HbA1c, HOMA-IR and insulin levels.

Results were further amplified in patients with baseline HbA1c >7%, a threshold for uncontrolled T2D.

PARAGRAPH

Importantly, in the current study, daily oral administration of MSDC-0602K over 12 months was well tolerated with fewer patients discontinuing active study drug than placebo.

Protocol-required assessments showed small and similar decreases in the prevalence of edema at baseline and 12 months across all treatment groups.

While treatment with first-generation TZDs have been associated with a 50–70% increase in the occurrence of side effects such as edema, fractures and hypoglycemia,7,8 no evidence of an increase in these effects was observed with MSDC-0602K treatment in this large phase II dose-ranging study.

PARAGRAPH

Treatment for T2D that is highly effective, administered orally, well tolerated and without major side effects is still a major unmet need.

Other currently available T2D therapies have either limited efficacy and/or significant side effects, such as hypoglycemia, nausea and gastrointestinal side effects, or must be administered subcutaneously.

Thus, if confirmed, treatment with MSDC-0602K for glucose control would have welcomed utility in clinical practice.

PARAGRAPH

An important goal of a therapy directed at patients with insulin resistance and NASH is improved outcomes.

While most compounds in development are focused on preventing adverse liver-related outcomes, including progression to cirrhosis and liver transplant, patients with NASH, and particularly those with NASH and T2D are much more likely to have adverse outcomes – including death – related to cardiovascular disease.25,26

The first-generation TZD pioglitazone has been shown to reduce adverse cardiovascular events in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients.7,8

MSDC-0602K preserves the beneficial effects observed with first-generation insulin sensitizers, including improved insulin resistance and decreased insulin levels, which have been shown to be associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes.27,28

PARAGRAPH

We postulate that an insulin-sensitizing drug such as MSDC-0602K, when given to patients with NASH who have both insulin resistance and impaired insulin clearance, may act positively on insulin in 2 ways; the first is reduced production as a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity and the second is improved insulin clearance resulting from improved liver cell health.

It is known that steatosis is closely linked to impaired insulin clearance29 and the greatest effect of MSDC-0602K on NAS components of the liver biopsy in this study was on steatosis.

It therefore follows that the enrichment of these patients via AST and HbA1c may yield a population more likely to benefit from such a drug.

PARAGRAPH

MSDC-0602K treatment was associated with weight gain.

Although the weight gain may represent an adverse event for the patient, it was of modest magnitude and not associated with the same increase in insulin associated with weight gain in placebo-treated patients, suggesting that insulin resistance has not worsened in patients gaining weight while treated with MSDC-0602K.

Support for this seeming paradox was noted in a post hoc analysis of the PROactive pioglitazone trial, which showed that weight gain in patients was associated with decreased CV risk in patients treated with pioglitazone but not controls.30

Hence, weight gain may be a consequence of insulin sensitization, related to an overall metabolic benefit.

PARAGRAPH

Despite the lack of a statistically significant effect on liver biopsy endpoints as defined in the study, the results of this study support conducting an appropriately sized phase III trial to examine whether this new, oral insulin-sensitizing therapy can improve CV outcomes in patients with T2D and its associated liver disease.

PARAGRAPH

This was a dose-ranging phase IIb study and should be taken as hypothesis generating; no adjustment for multiplicity was undertaken and hence nominal statistical significance should be regarded in this context.

Future trials will be needed to replicate these results.

The issues observed with regard to interpretation of liver biopsies for NASH may in part relate to the fact that the hepatopathologist read digitized images of the actual slides.

PARAGRAPH

In the EMMINENCE phase IIb study, although MSDC-0602K did not demonstrate statistically significant effects on liver histology, MSDC-0602K treatment was associated with better glucose metabolism, reduced insulin levels, and improvement in hepatic injury measures.

Safety limitations observed with the first-generation insulin sensitizers were not evident, enabling simple oral administration and excellent tolerability.

Financial support

PARAGRAPH

The study was funded by Cirius Therapeutics, Inc, developer of MSDC-0602K, which was responsible in conjunction with the Executive Committee for study design and conduct, data interpretation, manuscript preparation, and the decision to submit for publication.

Cirius retained a contract research organization (CRO) for site and data management and a statistical group independent of study conduct that performed the data analysis.

The sponsor was responsible for safety monitoring through the CRO.

Another contractor managed the integrated interactive web randomization and clinical supply management systems.
