TITLE

Hepatic-targeted RNA interference provides robust and persistent knockdown of alpha-1 antitrypsin levels in ZZ patients

PARAGRAPH

Accumulation of abnormal proteins in the livers of patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency may lead to decreased liver function and potentially liver failure.

Therapeutics targeting the production of these abnormal proteins may be used to prevent or treat liver disease in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
