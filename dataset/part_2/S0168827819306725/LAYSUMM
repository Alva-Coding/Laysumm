TITLE

Educate, Test and Treat Model towards elimination of hepatitis C infection in Egypt: Feasibility and effectiveness in 73 villages

PARAGRAPH

A large community-based educate, test and treat hepatitis C programme was conducted in more than 200,000 villagers across 73 villages in Egypt.

This study demonstrates that a simplified care model can achieve high uptake of testing, linkage to care and treatment, with high cure rates.

We consider this a model for the elimination of hepatitis C virus infection in rural communities, which can be applied to other countries highly affected by hepatitis C.
