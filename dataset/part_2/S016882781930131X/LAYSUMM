TITLE

OX40 stimulation and PD-L1 blockade synergistically augment HBV-specific CD4 T cells in patients with HBeAg-negative infection

PARAGRAPH

CD4 T cells are important in controlling viral infections but are impaired in the context of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

Therapeutic approaches to cure chronic HBV infection are highly likely to require an immune-stimulatory component.

This study demonstrates that HBV-specific CD4 T cells can be functionally augmented by combined stimulation of the co-stimulatory molecule OX40 and blockade of the inhibitory PD-1 pathway.
