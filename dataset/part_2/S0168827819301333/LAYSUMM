TITLE

Response to direct-acting antiviral therapy among ongoing drug users and people receiving opioid substitution therapy

PARAGRAPH

Patients with hepatitis C virus infection who are on opioid agonist therapy can achieve high cure rates with current treatments.

The use of illicit drugs during treatment can drive drop-outs and reduce cure rates.

However, hepatitis C can be cured in most of those using drugs who complete treatment and follow-up.
