TITLE

The psychomotor vigilance task: Role in the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy and relationship with driving ability

PARAGRAPH

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complication of advanced liver disease that can manifest as excessive sleepiness.

Some patients with HE have been shown to have difficulty driving.

Herein, we used a test called the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), which measures sleepiness and can also be used to assess driving competence.

We showed that PVT performance is fairly stable in healthy individuals.

We also showed that PVT performance parallels performance in tests which are commonly used in cirrhotic patients to measure HE.

We suggest that this test is helpful in quantifying HE and identifying dangerous drivers among patients with cirrhosis.
