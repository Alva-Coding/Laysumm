TITLE

Loss of hepatocyte β-catenin protects mice from experimental porphyria-associated liver injury

PARAGRAPH

Porphyrias are disorders resulting from abnormalities in the steps that lead to heme production, which cause build-up of toxic by-products called porphyrins.

Liver is commonly either a source or a target of excess porphyrins, and complications can range from minor abnormalities to liver failure.

In this report, we inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling in an experimental model of porphyria, which resulted in decreased liver injury.

Targeting β-catenin affected multiple components of the heme biosynthesis pathway, thus preventing build-up of porphyrin intermediates.

Our study suggests that drugs inhibiting β-catenin activity could reduce the amount of porphyrin accumulation and help alleviate symptoms in patients with porphyria.
