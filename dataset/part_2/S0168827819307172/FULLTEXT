TITLE

Reassessing the accuracy of PAGE-B-related scores to predict hepatocellular carcinoma development in patients with chronic hepatitis B

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a major healthcare problem in Asia.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a key complication and cause of mortality of CHB.[1]

To prevent mortality related to HCC, high-risk patients should be identified and treated.

With the introduction of nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA), potent viral suppression leads to fibrosis and cirrhosis regression, reduction of cirrhotic complications, and reduced liver-related mortality.[2]

Although the risk of HCC is reduced by NA, this dreadful complication still exists particularly in cirrhotic patients.[3, 4]

In a long-term follow-up study in Europe, new cases of HCC still developed even after more than 5 years of NA treatment.[5]

A Korean report showed that the age-standardised death rate related to HCC only reduced modestly by 27% as compared to a 75% reduction in liver-related death between 1999-2013 despite extensive use of antiviral agents.[6]

PARAGRAPH

A second line of prevention of HCC-related mortality will be regular surveillance by ultrasonography and alpha-fetoprotein testing.

There are good data to support half-yearly HCC surveillance can pick up early HCC for curative treatment, which may lead to an improved patient survival.[7]

Owing to the residual HCC risk on NA, patients should still undergo HCC surveillance even under NA treatment.

However, HCC surveillance is resource intensive and demands long-term patient adherence to the program.

As NA treatment regresses liver fibrosis and reduces the risk of HCC, some of the treated patients may have HCC risk reduced to such a low level that does not warrant HCC surveillance.

Based on the recommendations of American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, an annual HCC risk of <0.2% is probably not cost-effective for HCC surveillance.[8]

It will therefore be useful if one can predict the HCC risk among patients on NA, and exempt the low risk patients from HCC surveillance.[9]

PARAGRAPH

Numerous risk scores have been developed to predict the risk of HCC.

Early scores are largely developed in Asia from untreated patients, including the guide with age, gender, HBV DNA, core promoter mutations and cirrhosis-HCC (GAG-HCC),[10] the Chinese University of Hong Kong-HCC score (CU-HCC),[11] the risk estimation for HCC in CHB score (REACH-B),[12] and liver stiffness measurement-HCC score (LSM-HCC).[13]

Among NA-treated patients, these scores have been found to have modest prediction of HCC in Asia, but their performances are not satisfactory in Caucasian patients.[14, 15]

As HBV DNA is usually suppressed in NA-treated patients, its role in predicting HCC development is much less than in untreated patients.

A simple risk score based on age, gender and platelet (PAGE-B) has been developed among Caucasian patients on entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) to predict HCC risk for up to 5 years.[16]

PAGE-B score was subsequently modified slightly by Korean investigators by adding serum albumin and adjusting the weighting of age, gender and platelet count (mPAGE-B).[17]

As these scores are based on objective demographic and laboratory parameters, they have the potential to be widely used in clinical practice.

However, how and when to use these risk scores remains undetermined.

PARAGRAPH

In this study, we aimed to validate the performance of PAGE-B and mPAGE-B scores to predict HCC in NA-treated Chinese patients in Hong Kong, and to evaluate the use of these two scores to screen out patients who could be exempted from HCC surveillance during NA treatment.

Methods

PARAGRAPH

Study Design and Data Source.

A retrospective cohort study was performed using data from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS) under the management of Hospital Authority, Hong Kong.[18]

CDARS is an electronic healthcare database that covers the patients’ demographic, cause of death, diagnoses, procedures, drug prescription and dispensing history, and laboratory parameters from all public hospitals and clinics in Hong Kong.

It represents in-patient and out-patient data of around 80% of the 7.4-million population in Hong Kong.[19]

All patients in CDARS are de-identified to ensure confidentiality.

Different territory-wide studies have been conducted using CDARS.[20-22]

The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) coding system was used in CDARS.

The use of ICD-9-CM codes in CDARS to identify hepatic events has been found 99% accurate when referenced to clinical, laboratory, imaging and endoscopy results from the electronic medical records.[23]

PARAGRAPH

Subjects.

Consecutive adult CHB patients who received ETV or TDF treatment between January 2005 and June 2018 were identified.

HCC surveillance was done every six to twelve months by ultrasound and alpha-fetoprotein testing under the Hospital Authority.

PAGE-B score and mPAGE-B score were calculated as described.[16, 17]

Patients co-infected with hepatitis C virus and/or hepatitis D virus based on ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes, viral and serological markers and/or use of antiviral therapy for hepatitis C; co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus based on ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes and/or use of antiviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus; had other coexisting autoimmune and metabolic liver diseases based on ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes; had cancer including HCC and/or liver transplantation before ETV/TDF treatment; had HCC and/or liver transplantation within the first six months after ETV/TDF treatment; had ETV/TDF treatment exposure less than six months; follow-up duration less than six months; received rituximab and any chemotherapeutic agents; and unavailable PAGE-B or mPAGE-B scores were excluded (Supplementary Tables 1-3).

We also excluded patients with ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes of acute hepatitis B and/or positive immunoglobulin M to hepatitis B core antigen unless it was more than six months apart from a positive hepatitis B surface antigen result.

Patients were followed until diagnosis of HCC, death, liver transplantation, stopping antiviral treatment, last follow-up date (December 31, 2018), or up to five years of follow-up, whichever came first.

The study protocol was approved by the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong - New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee.

PARAGRAPH

Data collection.

Data were retrieved from CDARS in January 2019.

Baseline date was defined as the date of starting ETV or TDF treatment.

Demographic data including date of birth and gender were captured.

At baseline, liver and renal biochemistries, hematological and virologic parameters were collected.

Thereafter, serial liver and renal biochemistries as well as HBV viral markers were collected until the last follow-up date (Supplementary Table 1).

We also retrieved data on other relevant diagnoses, procedures, concomitant drugs, laboratory parameters, and exposure to other NA (i.e. adefovir dipivoxil, lamivudine, and telbivudine) and (pegylated)-interferon for any duration (Supplementary Tables 2-3).

PARAGRAPH

Definitions.

The primary endpoint was HCC.

HCC was identified based on diagnosis codes (155.0-hepatocellular carcinoma and 155.2-carcinoma of liver) or procedure codes for HCC treatment according to ICD-9-CM codes from CDARS.

Liver cirrhosis was identified by ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for cirrhosis and its related complications (Supplementary Table 3).

Decompensated cirrhosis was defined by ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for hepatic decompensation including ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome (Supplementary Table 3).

Hypertension was identified by any use of anti-hypertensive drugs and/or ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes (Supplementary Table 3).

Diabetes mellitus was defined by exposure to any anti-diabetic agents, and/or haemoglobin A1c ≥6.5%, and/or fasting plasma glucose ≥7 mmol/L in two measurements or ≥11.1 mmol/L in one measurement, and/or the ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for DM (250.00–250.93).[24]

Excessive alcohol use was defined by ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for alcohol-related diseases.[25]

PARAGRAPH

Statistical analysis.

Data were analysed using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) version 25.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois), and R software (3.5.3; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Continuous variables were expressed in mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range [IQR]), as appropriate, while categorical variables were presented as frequency (percentage).

Difference in proportion of patients who developed HCC between risk groups based on suggested cut-off values of PAGE-B and mPAGE-B scores were analysed by Chi-square test for linear trend.

Gray’s method was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of HCC with 95% confidence interval (CI); Gray’s test was used to compare the cumulative incidence function of different risk groups.

The performance of PAGE-B and mPAGE-B scores in predicting HCC development was assessed by area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).[26]

The 95% CI for the comparison of two ROC curves was computed by bootstrap sampling of 1,000 samples.

Diagnostic accuracy of the suggested cut-off values was assessed by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) with 95% CI.

A time-dependent analysis on the subgroup of patients at their second year of ETV or TDF treatment was performed.

All statistical tests were two-sided.

P<0.05 was taken as statistically significant.

PARAGRAPH

The low cut-off value of PAGE-B score achieved a NPV (95% CI) of 99.7% (99.5%-99.8%) and 99.6% (99.4%-99.7%) to exclude patients who did not develop HCC in 3 and 5 years, respectively.

Similarly, the low cut-off value of mPAGE-B score achieved a NPV (95% CI) of 99.7% (99.5%-99.8%) and 99.6% (99.4%-99.7%) to exclude patients who did not develop HCC in 3 and 5 years, respectively (Table 2).

PARAGRAPH

Discrepancy of low risk classification between PAGE B and mPAGE-B scores.

Among 32,150 patients, 9,417 (29.3%) patients were classified as low risk of HCC development by either PAGE-B score or mPAGE-B score.

Discrepancy existed between the classifications of low risk by the two scores.

Among 7,198 patients who were classified as low HCC risk by PAGE-B score, 1,638 (22.8%) and 33 (0.5%) were classified as intermediate risk and high risk by mPAGE-B score, respectively.

Among 7,746 patients who were classified as low HCC risk by mPAGE-B score, 2,219 (28.6%) were classified as intermediate risk by PAGE-B score.

Among 9,417 patients of low HCC risk as defined by either PAGE-B or mPAGE-B scores, 5,527 (58.7%) and 3,890 (41.3%) patients got concordant and discordant classifications by the two scores; 17 (0.3%) and 26 (0.7%) patients developed HCC in 5 years, respectively.

The 3-year and 5-year cumulative incidence (95% CI) of HCC in patients with concordant classifications were 0.3% (0.2%-0.6%) and 0.4% (0.2%-0.7%), respectively.

The 3-year and 5-year cumulative incidence (95% CI) of HCC in patients with discordant classifications were 0.7% (0.4%-1.0%) and 0.9% (0.6%-1.3%), respectively.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this territory-wide cohort study in Hong Kong, we have validated good prediction of HCC development in 3-5 years among patients on first-line antiviral treatments (ETV and TDF) for CHB.

Although mPAGE-B score had statistically better performance than PAGE-B score, the discriminatory ability of these two scores for low risk patients was excellent and very comparable.

Under the low cut-off value of either scores, the estimated annual HCC risk was below 0.2%.

There was significant discordance in classifying patients into low risk category by these two risk scores; patients with discordant results had slightly higher HCC risk than those with concordant results.

PARAGRAPH

In PAGE-B and mPAGE-B scores, platelet count and serum albumin reflect portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis.

Validation of PAGE-B and mPAGE-B scores in this large patient cohort offers strong support that risk of HCC among NA-treated patients are largely related to their demography and severity of liver cirrhosis.

This association is not only true in Caucasian patients but also in Asian patients, as a recent Korean cohort has also confirmed good HCC prediction by these two scores in NA-treated patients.[27]

Taiwanese investigators have developed a score based on cirrhosis, age, male sex, and diabetes mellitus (CAMD score), which has an AUROC of >0.8 to predict HCC at 3 years.[28]

However, the diagnosis of cirrhosis in CAMD score is often subjective and can vary among centres, as liver biopsy will not be performed in the majority of patients before commencement of antiviral therapy.

Any misdiagnosis of liver cirrhosis in CAMD score will have drastic impact on the classification into different HCC risk groups.

LSM by transient elastography is a non-invasive tool that can partly replace liver biopsy for liver fibrosis assessment.[29]

Korean investigators have attempted to substitute LSM for HBV DNA in REACH-B score (modified REACH-B, mREACH-B score) to predict HCC risk in NA-treated patients.[30]

The overall HCC prediction of mREACH-B score was good with AUROC >0.8 for HCC at 3 and 5 years, but the NPVs at optimal cut-off value were not high enough to exclude HCC (98.3% for 3 years and 96.8% for 5 years).[31]

Furthermore, the availability of transient elastography will limit the general applicability of mREACH-B score in clinical practice.

PARAGRAPH

Despite the development of numerous HCC risk scores for a decade, there are still controversies on how and when to apply these risk scores in clinical practice.

Risk scores have not been incorporated in any of the regional clinical practice guidelines.[8, 32, 33]

In general, NA should be started in all patients with increased risk of cirrhotic complications and HCC.

Logically, HCC surveillance should also be carried out in all NA-treated patients.

In this study, we have shown that some NA-treated patients in fact have low HCC risk, an annual risk below the recommended cost-effective threshold of 0.2% for HCC surveillance.[8]

If low HCC risk is defined by either PAGE-B or mPAGE-B scores, i.e. the “OR” approach, 29.3% of NA-treated patients will be classified as low risk with an estimated annual HCC risk of approximately 0.12%.

With a more stringent definition of low HCC risk by both PAGE-B and mPAGE-B scores, i.e. the “AND” approach, 17.2% of NA-treated patients will be classified as low risk with an estimated annual HCC risk of approximately 0.08%.

This is very comparable to the HCC risk of patients who achieved seroclearance of hepatitis B surface antigen on ETV/TDF, with an 8-year cumulative incidence of 6% (estimated annual risk of 0.075%).[34]

The NPV of both the “OR” and “AND” approaches are beyond 99.5%.

The excellent performance of these two risk scores is very much in line with Korean and European experiences as reported in previous studies.[16, 17, 27]

However, the NPV to exclude HCC was less good among cirrhotic patients, and the estimated annual risk of HCC development was beyond 1% with a low risk score by PAGE-B and mPAGE-B.

PARAGRAPH

This study has the strength of a big sample size; it is the largest study by far to externally validate HCC risk scores in NA-treated CHB patients.

However, there are a few limitations.

First, as in all big data analyses, the availability of data depends on local practice of doctors, and investigations performed outside the Hospital Authority system would not be captured.

Approximately one-third patients had missing HBV DNA level in the database; hence we were unable to compute and validate HCC risk scores such as CU-HCC, GAG-HCC, and REACH-B.

Nonetheless, the performance of these HCC risk scores derived in untreated patients are far from satisfactory in NA-treated patients.[27, 31]

As transient elastography was not available in most of the hospitals during the study period, we were also unable to evaluate LSM-HCC and mREACH-B scores.

Otherwise, the Hong Kong Hospital Authority database has complete routine laboratory and demographic data allowing both PAGE-B and mPAGE-B scores to be evaluated with minimal missing data.

Second, the timing of coding of HCC by doctors will affect its relationship with the time of NA commencement.

In Hong Kong, the majority of patients with HCC are not diagnosed by hepatologists with regular HCC surveillance.[35]

As many HCC are referred as suspicious liver lesion on imaging, there might be a delay in the coding of HCC after the commencement of NA.

To minimise this potential bias of including prevalent HCC, we have excluded patients who have HCC coded within 6 months after NA was started.

There is a theoretical bias that low-risk patients may be less likely to undergo surveillance and thus have an underestimated HCC incidence.

We minimised the bias by capturing HCC identified at the time of death; CDARS is linked to the Hong Kong death registry for the date and cause of death.[36]

Third, a significant number of patients were excluded because antiviral therapy was not started before HCC development.

This was probably related to the stringent reimbursement criteria and high cost of antiviral therapy when these drugs were initially available in the public healthcare system.[37]

Fourth, it is possible that some patients have their cholangiocarcinoma wrongly diagnosed as HCC due to similar patterns of contrast uptake.

Although cholangiocarcinoma is uncommon, PAGE-B and mPAGE B scores might not be able to predict the risk of its development.

In this study, among 562 HCC patients with liver biopsy, only 1 patient who had cholangiocarcinoma was wrongly given a HCC diagnosis code.

Fifth, the validation of PAGE-B and mPAGE-B scores were up to 5 years in this study.

The rate of new HCC development may slightly decline after the fifth year of NA treatment.[5]

As PAGE-B and mPAGE-B scores are easily computed by routine laboratory tests, these scores can be monitored regularly in NA-treated patients.

In this study, we have shown that these two risk scores still offered excellent risk classification at 2 years of NA treatment.

PARAGRAPH

In summary, this study has proven excellent performance of PAGE-B and mPAGE-B scores to identify patients with low HCC risk on ETV and TDF therapy.

As tenofovir alafenamide has a similar antiviral efficacy as TDF, it is reasonable to believe these scores will perform equally well in patients treated with this newer NA.[38, 39]

Patients who are classified as low HCC risk by either scores have an estimated annual risk of <0.2%, and therefore can be exempted from HCC surveillance.

It will lead to a healthcare resource saving by approximately 30%.

Future cost-effectiveness modelling studies can be performed to confirm this finding.

A large number of patients in this study had HCC developed prior to and within 6 months of antiviral therapy; it highlights the importance of careful investigation for pre-existing HCC in all patients at the commencement of antiviral therapy.

In fact, approximately 1.3%-1.4% of patients had prevalent HCC with a low PAGE-B or mPAGE-B score in this study.

Furthermore, caution should be taken for patients who have liver cirrhosis, as well those with other risk factors of HCC including metabolic syndrome and alcoholism.

These results will potentially influence government policies and clinical practice guidelines on the strategy of HCC surveillance for CHB patients on NA therapy.
