TITLE

Prognostic markers at adolescence in patients requiring liver transplantation for biliary atresia in adulthood

PARAGRAPH

Patients with biliary atresia commonly require liver transplantation before reaching adulthood.

Those who reach adulthood with their own liver are still at risk of needing a transplant.

This study aimed to identify tests that could help clinicians predict which patients with biliary atresia who reach the age of 16 without a transplant will require one in later life.

The study found that the presence of bilirubin ≥21 µmol/L, lower creatinine levels, and a history of portal hypertension or gastro-oesophageal varices at 16 years, as well as cholangitis in adolescence, could predict the future likelihood of needing a liver transplant for young people with biliary atresia.
