Quantitation of HBV cccDNA in anti-HBc-positive liver donors by droplet digital PCR: A new tool to detect occult infection

PARAGRAPH

The covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) form of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) sustains the persistence of the virus even decades after resolution of the symptomatic infection (occult HBV infection).

In the present study we developed a highly sensitive method based on droplet digital PCR technology for the detection and quantitation of HBV cccDNA in the liver of individuals with occult HBV infection.

We observed that the amount of HBV cccDNA may be inferred from the titer in serum of the IgG class antibody to the hepatitis B core antigen.

The quantitation of this antibody may represent a surrogate to determine which patients are at the highest risk of HBV reactivation following immunosuppressive therapies.
