TITLE

Eight-year survival in chronic hepatitis B patients under long-term entecavir or tenofovir therapy is similar to the general population

PARAGRAPH

Caucasian patients with chronic hepatitis B with or without compensated cirrhosis who receive long-term entecavir or tenofovir therapy have excellent overall eight-year survival, which is similar to that of the general population.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is the main factor affecting their overall mortality, and is the only factor affecting liver-related mortality in this setting.
