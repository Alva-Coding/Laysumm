TITLE

Eight-year survival in chronic hepatitis B patients under long-term entecavir or tenofovir therapy is similar to the general population

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease worldwide.1–3

Patients with chronic HBV infection may have low viral replication and no significant histological lesions, but a substantial proportion of them develop chronic hepatitis B (CHB) with high viral replication and active histological lesions.1,4,5

If left untreated, CHB leads to accumulation of liver fibrosis and eventually progresses to cirrhosis and liver decompensation, and is thus associated with high morbidity and mortality.1,4,5

It is estimated that 2–10% of untreated CHB patients develop cirrhosis every year,1,4,6 and that only 55–85% of untreated patients with active HBV cirrhosis are alive five years later.4,6,7

In addition, all patients with chronic HBV infection are at higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when compared with the general population, but the risk is highest when cirrhosis is present.1,5,6

Thus, more than 750,000 people die every year of HBV-related causes.8

PARAGRAPH

Over the past 15 years, the development of safe and effective therapies has improved the outcome of CHB patients who receive appropriate diagnosis and treatment.5,9

In particular, during the past 10 years, the use of current first-line nucleos(t)ide analogues, such as entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), has offered prolonged inhibition of HBV replication in almost all adherent CHB patients, reduction of liver necroinflammation and fibrosis, sometimes reversion of histological cirrhosis, and prevention or even reversal of early liver decompensation.1,5

Moreover, long-term ETV or TDF therapy has been shown to decrease but not eliminate the risk of HCC.10–15

However, the effect of long-term antiviral therapy on survival has not been adequately assessed in this setting.

PARAGRAPH

The aim of this large, multicentre, cohort study was to evaluate the probability of survival and factors affecting survival in Caucasian CHB patients receiving long-term therapy with ETV or TDF.

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Patient population

PARAGRAPH

This ongoing cohort study included all Caucasian adult CHB patients (age, ≥16 years) followed up at the liver clinics of the 10 participating centres who had received treatment with ETV or TDF for ≥12 months started before December 2012.

Patients with decompensated cirrhosis, HCC diagnosed before the start of ETV/TDF therapy, or coinfection(s) with hepatitis D, hepatitis C, or HIV and liver transplant patients were excluded.

Patients naive to or previously treated with other nucleos(t)ide analogues were included.

There were four participating centres in Greece (two in Athens, one in Larissa, and one in Thessaloniki; n = 782), two in Spain (Barcelona, Madrid; n = 203), and one in Germany (Leipzig; n = 148), Italy (Milan; n = 487), The Netherlands (Rotterdam; n = 89), and Turkey (Ankara; n = 242).

There was no funding source for the collection, analysis, and interpretation of the data, or for any part of this work.

SECTION

Follow-up: definitions

PARAGRAPH

As previously described,10 CHB diagnosis was based on HBsAg positivity for ≥6 months, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, and serum HBV DNA level >2,000 IU/ml.

Liver disease severity was classified as CHB only (without cirrhosis) according to findings from liver biopsies and CHB with compensated cirrhosis according to histological (Ishak’s stage 6) or elastographic (reliable liver stiffness measurement >14 kPa) findings.

Patients without pretreatment liver biopsy or elastography were considered as having unclassified disease severity.

Alcohol use in males or females was classified as none/mild if they reported a mean daily alcohol use of <20 or <10 g, moderate if they reported a mean daily alcohol use of 20–60 or 10–40 g, and abuse if they reported a mean daily alcohol use of >60 or >40 g, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

All patients were treated with ETV (0.5 mg/day) and/or TDF (300 mg/day) and followed up at each participating centre according to international and/or national clinical practice guidelines.

Clinical examination and routine laboratory tests were performed at least every six months.

Serum HBV DNA levels were determined every 6–12 months in the laboratory of each centre by various polymerase chain reaction assays (sensitivity 10–80 IU/ml).

Virological remission was considered to be present in patients who achieved an HBV DNA <80 IU/ml that was maintained throughout ETV/TDF therapy.

Ultrasonography with or without alpha fetoprotein measurements was performed at least every six months in patients with cirrhosis and at least every 12 months in patients without cirrhosis.

The diagnosis of HCC was based on standard histological and/or compatible radiological findings.16

PARAGRAPH

Entry into this study (baseline) was defined as the date of the start of ETV/TDF therapy.

Follow-up was considered as the time interval between study entry and the date of death or liver transplantation or the last available clinical information until April 2016, whereas treatment duration was considered as the time interval between study entry and the end of therapy or the last on-therapy follow-up.

The analysis time was the time interval between study entry and the date of the event (death, liver transplantation).

For patients who had not experienced the event, time was censored at the date of the last follow-up or at 10 years.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

All data were analysed with Stata 11.2 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas, USA) and R (version 3.2.1) (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Continuous variables are presented as their median values and interquartile range, unless otherwise stated.

Categorical variables were summarized as the number of cases.

PARAGRAPH

Kaplan–Meier estimates of cumulative survival or mortality were obtained.

The following three outcomes were considered: death from any cause (overall survival/mortality), liver-related death (liver-related survival/mortality), and liver-related death and/or liver transplantation (transplantation and liver-related survival/mortality).

Univariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the effect of various variables on mortality, whereas multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify independent prognostic factors.

Explanatory variables entered into the model were measured at baseline, with the exception of HCC occurrence.

Since HCC developed during therapy, it was modelled as a time-dependent covariate taking into consideration the time of HCC diagnosis from the start of therapy.

Hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI), along with corresponding p values, are presented.

PARAGRAPH

The mortality of CHB patients was compared with the mortality of the general population in the corresponding countries by means of the standardized mortality ratio (SMR).

SMR was calculated as the ratio of the observed number of deaths in our sample of patients to the number of deaths that would be expected if our patients experienced the same mortality as the general population.

To estimate the expected number of deaths, we used the general population mortality rates stratified by country, age, sex, and calendar year obtained from the Human Mortality Database (http://www.mortality.org).

This approach has been used extensively, particularly in HIV and hepatitis C virus infections.17–19

The number of deaths expected in the at-risk period was obtained by our applying these age-, sex-, country- and year-specific mortality rates of the general population to the cohort of CHB patients.

If rates were not available in the database for recent years, the available rates for the most recent year were used.

The analysis was restricted to individuals in countries for which such data were available in the Human Mortality Database.

As a result, patients from Turkey were not included in the estimation of SMR.

SMRs were also estimated in subgroups of patients according to their demographic or clinical characteristics (sex, absence/presence of cirrhosis, absence/presence of HCC).

The corresponding 95% CIs were calculated for each SMR by our assuming that the observed deaths followed a Poisson distribution.20

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

In total, 1,951 patients with CHB fulfilled all inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in this study.

Of them, 526 (27%) had compensated cirrhosis at baseline according to histological (n = 336) or elastographic (n = 190) findings, whereas the liver disease severity could not be classified in 46 cases (2%).

Their main baseline characteristics at the start of ETV or TDF therapy are presented in Table 1.

SECTION

Overall survival

PARAGRAPH

During a median follow-up of six (range, 1–14) years, 84 (4.3%) of the 1,951 patients died of any cause (Table 2).

The overall mortality rate was 0.77 (95% CI 0.62–0.96) deaths per 100 patients per year.

The one-, three-, five-, and eight-year overall cumulative survival probabilities were 99.7, 97.8, 95.9, and 94.1%, respectively (Fig. 1A).

PARAGRAPH

The effects of the patients’ baseline characteristics and of HCC development on the overall mortality are shown in Table S1.

In univariable Cox regression analysis, older age, lower platelet counts at baseline, no prior use of (pegylated) interferon alfa, presence of cirrhosis at baseline, and HCC development during therapy were associated with a higher risk of death.

In particular, the one-, three-, five-, and eight-year overall cumulative survival probabilities were 100, 98.5, 97.3, and 96.2% in patients without cirrhosis and 99.1, 95.9, 92.8, and 89.3% in patients with cirrhosis, respectively, (Log-rank test, p <0.001) (Fig. 2A).

HBV DNA levels or the presence of normal ALT levels at the start of or after one  year of ETV/TDF therapy had no effect on survival.

PARAGRAPH

In multivariable Cox regression analysis, older age (HR per year 1.04, 95% CI 1.02–1.06; p = 0.001), HCC development (HR 35.95, 95% CI 21.14–61.11; p <0.001), and lower platelet levels (HR per 104/mm3 increase 0.96, 95% CI 0.91–1.00; p = 0.0431) were independently associated with higher risk of death.

There was also a marginally statistically significant association with prior interferon alfa therapy (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.24–1.06; p = 0.071).

After adjustment for age, platelet levels, and HCC, the presence of cirrhosis was no longer statistically significant (Table 3).

SECTION

Liver-related survival

PARAGRAPH

Of the 1,951 patients, 34 (1.7%) (34 of 84 deaths; 40.5%) died of causes related to liver disease (Table 2).

The liver-related mortality rate was 0.31 (95% CI 0.22–0.44) deaths per 100 patients per year, whereas the one-, three-, five-, and eight-year cumulative probabilities of liver-related survival were 99.9, 99.4, 98.3, and 97.4%, respectively (Fig. 1B).

PARAGRAPH

In univariable analyses, male sex and all factors associated with the overall mortality, such as older age, lower platelet counts at baseline, no prior use of (pegylated) interferon alfa, presence of cirrhosis at baseline, and HCC development during therapy, were associated with a higher risk of liver-related death (Table S1).

The one-, three-, five-, and eight-year cumulative probabilities of liver-related survival were 100, 99.9, 99.2, and 98.8% in CHB patients without cirrhosis and 99.4, 97.8, 96.1, and 94.1% in CHB patients with cirrhosis at baseline, respectively (Log-rank test, p <0.001) (Fig. 2B).

PARAGRAPH

In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model including age, sex, platelet counts, prior use of (pegylated) interferon alfa, presence of baseline cirrhosis, and HCC development, only HCC occurrence was associated with higher risk of liver-related death (HR 139.20, 95% CI 48.59–398.79, p <0.001) (Table 3).

PARAGRAPH

During the study period, another 17 patients (0.9%) underwent liver transplantation (Table 2).

Thus, 51 (2.6%) of the 1,951 patients had a major liver-related event (death or transplantation).

The corresponding rate was 0.47 (95% CI 0.36–0.62) transplantations or liver-related deaths per 100 patients per year, whereas the one-, three-, five-, and eight-year transplantation free-liver related cumulative survival was 99.9, 99.2, 97.8, and 95.8%, respectively (Fig. 1C).

PARAGRAPH

Age, sex, baseline platelet counts, prior use of (pegylated) interferon alfa, baseline cirrhosis, and HCC development were also associated with increased risk of transplantation or liver-related death in the univariable analyses (see Table S1).

The one-, three-, five-, and eight-year transplantation-free liver-related cumulative survival was 100, 99.8, 99.1, and 97.5%, respectively, in CHB patients without cirrhosis and 99.4, 97.4, 94.6, and 91.8%, respectively, in CHB patients with cirrhosis at baseline (Log-rank test, p <0.001) (Fig. 2C).

In multivariable Cox regression analysis, only HCC occurrence (HR 169.13, 95% CI 68.49–417.66, p <0.001) and lower platelet counts (HR per 104/mm3 increase 0.93, 95% CI 0.87–0.98, p = 0.012) were independently associated with increased risk of liver transplantation or liver-related death (Table 3).

SECTION

Survival in patients with and without HCC

PARAGRAPH

Until April 2016, HCC was diagnosed in 118 (6.0%) of the 1,951 patients.

The median (25th percentile, 75th percentile) follow-up after HCC diagnosis was 19.2 (6.8, 34.0) months.

Of these 118 patients, three (2.5%) died of a liver-unrelated cause, 29 (24.6%) died as a consequence of the HCC, and 15 (12.7%) underwent liver transplantation (Table 2).

The overall mortality rate was 5.88 (95% CI 3.85–7.70) deaths per 100 patients with HCC per year.

The effects of the patient baseline characteristics on the mortality related to any cause or liver-related causes in patients with HCC are shown in Table S2.

Except for baseline ALT levels for all types of mortality and baseline HBV DNA levels for overall mortality, no other factor was associated with overall or liver-related mortality in patients who developed HCC.

In relation to the presence of baseline cirrhosis, 17 (45.9%) of 37 patients without cirrhosis and with HCC and 26 (32.5%) of 80 patients with cirrhosis and HCC died as a result of liver-related causes or underwent liver transplantation.

The transplantation-free liver-related survival rates were not affected by the presence of baseline cirrhosis in patients with HCC (Log-rank rest, p = 0.270) (Fig. 3A).

The mortality rates after HCC diagnosis were 12.05 (95% CI 9.18–18.55) deaths from all causes, 11.78 (95% CI 8.14–17.07) liver-related deaths, and 18.15 (95% CI 13.45–24.47) liver-related deaths or transplants per 100 HCC patients per year.

PARAGRAPH

Of the 1,833 patients who did not develop HCC, 47 (2.6%) died of a liver-unrelated cause, five (0.3%) died of liver disease, and two (0.1%) underwent liver transplantation (Table 2).

In particular, only one (0.01%) of the 1,342 patients without cirrhosis and HCC and six (1.3%) of the 446 patients with cirrhosis without HCC died of liver disease or underwent liver transplantation.

The transplantation-free liver-related survival rate was significantly higher in patients without HCC who did not have cirrhosis compared with those who had cirrhosis at baseline (Log-rank test, p <0.001) (Fig. 3B).

The patient without cirrhosis developed lymphoma, which was treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and developed acute cholecystitis and was subsequently considered to have died of liver disease.

Of the four patients with cirrhosis who died, two reported alcohol abuse, one developed liver decompensation after orthopaedic surgery at four months after the start of HBV therapy, and one developed recurrent uncontrolled variceal bleeding at five months after the start of HBV therapy.

Of the two patients who underwent liver transplantation, both had cirrhosis at baseline.

One of them developed liver decompensation at three months after the start of HBV therapy, and the other developed autoimmune hepatitis which did not respond to therapy with steroids.

PARAGRAPH

The effects of the patient baseline characteristics on mortality related to any cause or liver-related causes in patients without HCC are shown in Table S3.

In univariable analyses in this patient subgroup, a higher risk of death from any cause was associated with older age, lower platelet counts at baseline, no prior use of (pegylated) interferon alfa, and the presence of cirrhosis, but only older age (HR per year increase 1.07, 95% CI 1.04–1.10, p <0.001) and lower platelet counts (HR per 104/mm3 increase 0.93, 95% CI 0.88–0.98, p = 0.007) remained as independent factors associated with overall mortality in the multivariable analysis (Table 3).

In univariable analyses, lower platelet counts and baseline cirrhosis were also associated with higher probability of liver-related death or transplantation- and liver-related death, which was related additionally to lower baseline HBV DNA levels (see Table S3).

In multivariable analyses, however, only lower platelet counts were associated with increased risk of liver-related death or transplantation (HR per 104/mm3 increase 0.82, 95% CI 0.71–0.96; p = 0.014), whereas no factor was independently associated with liver-related death only (Table 3).

SECTION

Comparisons with the mortality of the general population

PARAGRAPH

The mortality in our total cohort of CHB patients was similar to that of the general population matched for country, age, sex, and calendar year, as SMR was estimated to be 0.82 (95% CI 0.66–1.03).

The SMR was 0.78 (95% CI 0.61–1.01) for male patients and 1.00 (95% CI 0.63–1.59) for female patients.

Compared with the general population, the SMR was lower in our CHB patients without cirrhosis (0.58, 95% CI 0.41–0.82) and was similar in our CHB patients with cirrhosis (1.22, 95% CI 0.90–1.66).

Moreover, the SMR was lower than that in the general population in our CHB patients who did not develop HCC regardless of the presence of baseline cirrhosis (0.58, 95% CI 0.44–0.77), whereas it was higher than that in the general population in our patients who developed HCC (3.09, 95% CI 2.13–4.48) (Table 4).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Our study shows that Caucasian CHB patients with or without compensated cirrhosis treated with long-term ETV or TDF therapy have excellent overall survival, which exceeds 95% at five years and is just below 95% (94%) at eight years.

If only liver-related deaths with or without liver transplantation are taken into consideration, the survival rates are even higher, ranging from 98 to 99% at five years and from 96 to 97% at eight years.

To our knowledge, this is the first large cohort study evaluating long-term survival of Caucasian CHB patients treated with the currently used oral agents with a high barrier to HBV resistance and comparing long-term survival with that of the general population.

Previous population-based data from Australia suggested that non-HCC liver-related mortality is reduced in patients with chronic HBV infection by improvements in treatment efficacy and uptake,21 and previous randomized or cohort studies, mostly from Asia22–26 but also from Europe,27 reported improved long-term outcomes in CHB patients treated with oral antivirals.

Almost all previous studies, however, had relatively short durations of mean/median follow-up (3–4 years),22–27 usually included patients treated with agents with a low genetic barrier to resistance such as lamivudine,22,25,26 and compared the outcomes of treated patients with those of CHB patients who remained untreated22,24–26 or were treated with different agents.23,26

Thus, our findings significantly extend knowledge of the beneficial effects of current antiviral therapy on the long-term survival of CHB patients.

PARAGRAPH

The mortality rate in our treated CHB patients was not significantly different than the rate expected for the general population (SMR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66–1.03) according to the Human Mortality Database and after matching for country, age, sex, and calendar year.

Such a finding is reassuring, since increased all-cause mortality has been reported in untreated patients with chronic HBV infection, including both CHB patients and inactive HBV carriers living in European countries, with SMR ranging from 1.7 to 2.3.28,29

Compared with the general population, the mortality rates were lower in our patients without cirrhosis (SMR 0.58) and most importantly in our CHB patients who did not develop HCC regardless of the presence of baseline cirrhosis (SMR 0.58).

On the basis of these findings we can reasonably conclude that patients with diagnosed and appropriately treated CHB have an expected survival rate similar to that of the general population.

The reasons for improved survival in patients without cirrhosis or in CHB patients without HCC are unclear, but they might be associated with better overall follow-up and/or more frequent adoptions of careful behaviours and lifestyle, since CHB patients are advised to maintain normal body weight, avoid drinking alcohol, stop smoking, and generally follow a healthy way of living.

We did not observe any association between factors that are generally known to affect survival, such as diabetes and obesity, but this may be due to the small proportions of patients with such factors (9–13%), the relatively short follow-up for such effects, and/or the dominant role of a HBV-related effect on our patients’ mortality.

In any case, the excellent survival of patients with diagnosed and appropriately treated CHB suggests that the targets set by the World Health Organization for reductions in mortality are feasible at least in European countries.30

PARAGRAPH

Overall mortality was independently associated with older age and development of HCC, and there was a trend for independent associations with lower platelet counts and prior interferon alfa therapy.

Liver-related mortality was associated only with HCC development, whereas transplantation-free liver-related mortality was independently associated with HCC development and lower platelet counts at baseline.

It is well known that HCC results in substantially reduced patient survival,31 and therefore the associations of HCC development with increased mortality of any type are reasonable findings and further support that HCC is the main factor affecting survival of CHB patients in recent years.1,5,23,31

Our patients who developed HCC were the only subgroup with a higher mortality rate than that of the general population (SMR 3.09).

PARAGRAPH

The association of older age with overall mortality but not with mortality associated with liver-related causes with or without liver transplantation suggests that this is related to the obvious general association of older age with higher risk of death from any cause.8

The independent association of lower platelet counts with transplantation-free liver-related mortality but not with liver-related mortality only can be related to the use of liver transplantation in patients with more advanced liver disease expressed by the low platelet counts who developed HCC compared with patients with earlier stages of liver disease and HCC, who are usually managed with other treatment options.16

Lower platelet counts were also found to be associated with mortality of any type in the patients who did not develop HCC.

This finding is probably explained by the deaths or liver transplants which were considered to be liver related but resulted from HBV-unrelated triggering events in patients with advanced liver disease (six of seven such patients had cirrhosis at baseline and relatively low platelet counts).

PARAGRAPH

An interesting finding of our study is the absence of an independent association between the presence of cirrhosis at baseline and mortality of any type.

This further supports that there is no progression of liver disease in effectively treated CHB patients with compensated cirrhosis, who often achieve regression of histological cirrhosis after the first few years of antiviral therapy.32,33

Of course, cirrhosis remains a risk factor for HCC in treated CHB patients,10,11 and the vast majority of liver-related deaths and liver transplants occurred among patients with HCC.

Thus, it is reassuring that the risk of HCC seems to be decreasing beyond the first five years of ETV or TDF therapy, particularly in patients with cirrhosis at baseline,34 which is expected to have a favourable effect on their overall and liver-related long-term survival.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, Caucasian CHB patients with or without compensated cirrhosis treated with the current oral antiviral agents with a high barrier to resistance have excellent overall and liver-related eight-year survival, which is similar to that of the general population.

HCC is the main factor affecting their overall mortality, and is the only factor affecting their liver-related mortality.

Given that existing patients with CHB, particularly those whose liver disease remains undiagnosed, are becoming older and perhaps are progressing to more advanced stages of liver disease, the incidence of, and mortality related to, HBV-related HCC are expected to increase soon.31

Thus, effective screening programmes should be implemented for diagnosis and treatment of existing CHB patients at younger ages and earlier stages.

Since HCC may also develop in effectively treated patients,10,23,24 careful evaluation of the patients’ HCC risk and HCC surveillance are mandatory.11,35
