TITLE

Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial of Emricasan in Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) Cirrhosis with Severe Portal Hypertension

PARAGRAPH

Cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) is the main consequence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

Cirrhosis leads to high pressure in the portal vein which accounts for most of the complications of cirrhosis.

Reducing portal pressure is beneficial in patients with cirrhosis.

We studied the possibility that emricasan, a drug that improves inflammation and scarring in the liver, would reduce portal pressure in patients with NASH-related cirrhosis and severe portal hypertension.

Our results in a large, prospective, double-blind study could not demonstrate a beneficial effect of emricasan in these patients.
