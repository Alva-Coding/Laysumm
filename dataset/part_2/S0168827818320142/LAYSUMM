TITLE

CD36 palmitoylation disrupts free fatty acid metabolism and promotes tissue inflammation in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis

PARAGRAPH

Fatty acid translocase CD36 (CD36) is a multifunctional membrane protein which contributes to the development of liver steatosis.

In the present study, we demonstrated that the localization of CD36 on the plasma membrane of hepatocytes is increased in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

Blocking the palmitoylation of CD36 reduces CD36 distribution in hepatocyte plasma membranes and protects mice from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

The inhibition of CD36 palmitoylation not only improved fatty acid metabolic disorders but also reduced the inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo.

The present study suggests that CD36 palmitoylation is important for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis development and inhibition of CD36 palmitoylation could be used to cure non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.
