TITLE

Fetal origin confers radioresistance on liver macrophages via p21cip1/WAF1

PARAGRAPH

Kupffer cells (KCs) are the tissue-resident macrophages of the liver.

KCs can be originated from fetal precursors and from monocytes during the fetal stage and post-birth, respectively.

Most immune cells in mice are sensitive to lethal-irradiation-induced death, while a subset of KCs resists radiation-induced death.

These radioresistant KCs continue to live in the irradiated mice.

We discovered that this relatively radioresistant KC subset are the fetal-derived KCs, and they achieve this through cell-cycle arrest.

Understanding the radiobiology of KCs will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms that elicit radiation-induced liver disease.
