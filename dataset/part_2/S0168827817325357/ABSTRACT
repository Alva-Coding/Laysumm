ABSTRACT

TITLE

Impact of comorbidities on patient outcomes after interferon-free therapy-induced viral eradication in hepatitis C

PARAGRAPH

Patients with advanced liver fibrosis remain at risk of cirrhosis-related outcomes and those with severe comorbidities may not benefit from hepatitis C (HCV) eradication.

We aimed to collect data on all-cause mortality and relevant clinical events within the first two years of direct-acting antiviral therapy, whilst determining the prognostic capability of a comorbidity-based model.

PARAGRAPH

This was a prospective non-interventional study, from the beginning of direct-acting antiviral therapy to the event of interest (mortality) or up to two years of follow-up, including 14 Spanish University Hospitals.

Patients with HCV infection, irrespective of liver fibrosis stage, who received direct-acting antiviral therapy were used to build an estimation and a validation cohort.

Comorbidity was assessed according to Charlson comorbidity and CirCom indexes.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 3.4% (65/1,891) of individuals died within the first year, while 5.4% (102/1,891) died during the study.

After adjusting for cirrhosis, platelet count, alanine aminotransferase and sex, the following factors were independently associated with one-year mortality: Charlson index (hazard ratio [HR] 1.55; 95% CI 1.29–1.86; p = 0.0001), bilirubin (HR 1.39; 95% CI 1.11–1.75; p = 0.004), age (HR 1.06 95% CI 1.02–1.11; p = 0.005), international normalized ratio (HR 3.49; 95% CI 1.36–8.97; p = 0.010), and albumin (HR 0.18; 95% CI 0.09–0.37; p = 0.0001).

HepCom score showed a good calibration and discrimination (C-statistics 0.90), and was superior to the other prognostic scores (model for end-stage liver disease 0.81, Child-Pugh 0.72, CirCom 0.68) regarding one- and two-year mortality.

HepCom score identified low- (≤5.7 points: 2%–3%) and high-risk (≥25 points: 56%–59%) mortality groups, both in the estimation and validation cohorts.

The distribution of clinical events was similar between groups.

PARAGRAPH

The HepCom score, a combination of Charlson comorbidity index, age, and liver function (international normalized ratio, albumin, and bilirubin) enables detection of a group at high risk of one- and two-year mortality, and relevant clinical events, after starting direct-acting antiviral therapy.
