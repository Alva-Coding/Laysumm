TITLE

Impact of comorbidities on patient outcomes after interferon-free therapy-induced viral eradication in hepatitis C

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

The advent of new direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has dramatically changed the landscape of hepatitis C (HCV) treatment, by increasing efficacy1 and safety.2

The cure of infection creates a rupture in the natural history of the HCV disease.

Indeed, patients achieving sustained virologic response (SVR) showed decreased rates of all-cause mortality, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and decompensated cirrhosis, as well as less need for liver transplantation.3

However, patients with advanced liver fibrosis remain at risk of cirrhosis-related outcomes and patients with severe comorbidities may not benefit from viral clearance.

In this setting of excellent results, these factors could be disappointing for physicians, patients, and relatives.

PARAGRAPH

In the past, treatment based on interferon (IFN) did not reach many patients for safety reasons.4

Instead, DAA treatment has no specific contraindications according to current European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)5 and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)6 guidelines, with drug-drug interaction the main concern.7

Therefore, theoretically, we could treat all HCV patients irrespective of basal comorbidities, liver disease stage or age.

The aim would be to eradicate the virus in patients with mild disease and to improve survival in advanced liver disease.

However, many studies have demonstrated that HCV patients showed relevant extrahepatic comorbidities which could limit the impact of the treatment on health status beyond the eradication of the virus.8,9

Scores evaluating basal comorbidities include Charlson comorbidity index (Charlson index)10 and CirCom index11 (adapted for cirrhosis), together with model for end-stage liver disease (MELD)/Child-Pugh, which are able to assess liver dysfunction.

The use of these indexes is based on their accuracy and easy interpretation for clinicians.

However, it is challenging to integrate this prognostic information into clinical practice.

We conducted a prospective study in patients with hepatitis C to assess the impact of the objective measurement of basal comorbidities on health outcomes within the first two years of DAA treatment.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Selection of patients

PARAGRAPH

We prospectively recruited a multicenter cohort from 14 Spanish hospitals.

Consecutive patients were enrolled from January 2015 and were followed-up in the outpatient clinics until October 2017 (every patient up to 24 months).

Patients were included at any stage of liver fibrosis (from F0 to F4), irrespective of viral genotype.

They could have received treatment with IFN and ribavirin previously.

Cirrhosis was defined by liver biopsy, ultrasound or transient elastography (>13.5 kPa).

Liver dysfunction was evaluated by MELD and Child-Pugh score in cirrhotic patients.

Exclusion criteria were: age ≤18 years; IFN-based therapy; previous HCC; previous liver transplantation; on liver transplantation waiting list; treatment received in a randomized clinical trial.

PARAGRAPH

All patients provided written informed consent, and all data (including clinical, demographic and test results) were coded and deposited in the original clinical database.

The Ethics Committees of the participating hospitals approved the protocol.

The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.

SECTION

Definition of the aims and the outcomes

PARAGRAPH

The primary objective was to collect all-cause mortality within the first year from the beginning of the antiviral therapy (first day of prescription) and determine the impact of a comorbidity-based model on it.

The secondary aim was to collect relevant clinical events within the first year of treatment to make a real description of the natural history of the disease and help to make decisions in clinical practice.

Finally, we extended the validation of the comorbidity-based model during the second year from the initiation of the DAA therapy.

PARAGRAPH

Relevant clinical events were collected when they were life-threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or required medical intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.

In patients suffering from more than one relevant clinical event, the first one was recorded and served to censor the follow-up of the subject for this outcome.

Mortality and relevant clinical events were classified according to the organs and systems affected.

Both death and, especially, relevant clinical events were identified and recorded by the treating physician, who was simultaneously the study physician in the center.

Events belonging to a prespecified list of clinical entities were regrouped.

The study coordinators (corresponding authors) decided the final classification of the outcomes, in terms of the organs and systems affected, in case of any doubt.

DAA withdrawal (abrupt discontinuation or decrease in intake of the therapy, except those who died before finishing DAA therapy) was recorded.

PARAGRAPH

Charlson and CirCom indexes were calculated at the time of starting DAA therapy.

Charlson index comprises AIDS, cancer (metastasic, non-metastasic and haematologic), liver disease (mild and severe), diabetes mellitus (with and without complications), chronic kidney disease, hemiplegia, peptic ulcer, connective tissue disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, dementia, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, congestive heart failure, and acute myocardial infarction.10

CirCom index includes cancer (metastasic, non-metastasic and haematologic), chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, epilepsy, peripheral artery disease, congestive heart failure, and acute myocardial infarction, as well as substance abuse other than alcoholism.11

We communicated to the rest of centers the adequate information about the correct diagnosis of these comorbidities (based on the original findings of the published studies) before starting the study.

SECTION

Statistical analyses

PARAGRAPH

Statistical analyses and graphics were performed with SPSS (21.0, version; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and STATA (12.0, STATA Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).

To develop and validate our model, we drew two independent cohorts of 1,105 subjects for model development (hospitals from Sevilla, Cordoba, Malaga, Marbella, Huelva, Granada) and 786 individuals for model validation (hospitals from Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia, Santander, Albacete).

PARAGRAPH

Continuous variables are presented as means ± SD, while discrete outcomes as percentages.

Comparisons between groups were made using the Mann-Whitney U test, the Student t test or ANOVA for continuous variables, and the χ2 test or the Fisher’s exact test (when expected values in any of the cells of a contingency table were below five) for categorical data.

Survival curves were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method (log-rank test) since time-to-mortality, and time-to-event is crucial in interpreting the results.

Further, the Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CIs.

Variables that showed significance p <0.05 in univariable analysis (including sex due to the potential impact on the outcomes) were entered into the backward regression analysis.

The Cox proportional hazards model was constructed sequentially with variables introduced individually, and a significance level of p >0.05 was used to remove the variables from the model.

Akaike’s information criterion was additionally computed to select the most robust predictors.

Schoenfeld and Martingale residuals were used to check the proportional hazards assumption and nonlinearity, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

Calibration of the risk model (HepCom score) was assessed by comparing Cox-model predicted probabilities at various risk groups vs. observed event rates estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method.12

The Harrell’s concordance index (C-index) was used to assess the score’s discrimination ability.

C-index values and the corresponding 95% CIs were estimated for each main study time point.

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was computed to corroborate the results observed in the derivation and validation sets, determine the diagnostic accuracy of the predictive models and select different thresholds for predicting mortality.

The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), percent correctly classified, and likelihood ratios were computed for the selected cut-offs.

PARAGRAPH

The missing values were imputed by applying the multiple imputations method in which missing data are imputed or replaced with a set of plausible values.13

Consequently, some missing values of platelets (n = 4), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (n = 6), bilirubin (n = 6), creatinine (n = 6), albumin (n = 27), and international normalized ratio (INR) (n = 37) were imputed.

Results

SECTION

Patients’ characteristics

PARAGRAPH

Baseline features of the overall cohort, as well as estimation and validation cohorts, are presented (Table 1).

Briefly, cirrhotic patients represented the majority of the overall cohort (64.1% [1,212/1,891]), with 82.6% Child A, 15.7% Child B, and 1.8% Child C.

A total of 2.9% (56/1,891) of patients had MELD ≥15, and 16.4% (310/1,840) of patients disclosed previous or current alcohol use.

Most of the patients received sofosbuvir-based therapy (78.4% [1,483/1,891]), while ribavirin was added in 47.3% (895/1,891) of patients.

A total of 93.3% (1,736/1,861) of patients achieved SVR.

The eradication of the virus could not be checked in 1.6% (n = 30) of individuals because of death before 12 weeks of treatment had been completed.

According to basal comorbidities, those present in more than 5% of the overall population were arterial hypertension (27.8% [526/1,891]), diabetes mellitus (17% [321/1,891]), dyslipidemia (7.7% [146/1,891]), thyroid disease (6.8% [129/1,891]), chronic obstructive lung disease (5.4% [103/1,891]), and non-metastatic cancer (5.4% [103/1,891]) (Table S1).

The mean follow-up was 22.8 ± 3.1 months.

SECTION

Development of HepCom score

PARAGRAPH

Age (p <0.0001), platelet count (p <0.0001), INR (p <0.001), bilirubin (p = 0.003), albumin (p <0.0001) and ALT (p <0.0001), as well as the presence of cirrhosis (p <0.0001), were associated with one-year mortality in the estimation cohort.

Other variables such as gender distribution, type of DAA or ribavirin use were not associated with this outcome.

Charlson and CirCom indexes were related to poor survival as well.

After adjusting for cirrhosis, platelet count, ALT and gender distribution, Charlson index (HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.29–1.86; p = 0.0001), bilirubin (HR 1.39; 95% CI 1.11–1.75; p = 0.004), age (HR 1.06; 95% CI 1.02–1.11; p = 0.005), and INR (HR 3.49; 95% CI 1.36–8.97; p = 0.010) were independently associated with increased one-year mortality.

By contrast, albumin (HR 0.18; 95% CI 0.09–0.37; p = 0.0001) was negatively related to one-year mortality (Table 2).

PARAGRAPH

The individual risk score for one-year mortality was calculated using the following formula derived from the multivariable analysis:1/(1+e(4.322-0.059×Age[years]-0.437×Charlson index[points]-1.249×INR-0.331×bilirubin[mg/dL]+1.723×albumin[g/dL]))×100

SECTION

Calibration and discrimination ability of HepCom score

PARAGRAPH

The predicted mean survival curves were compared with the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the three risk groups (Fig. 1).

The predicted survival curves in the two datasets were almost identical, reflecting the similarity in the distributions of the prognostic index in each risk group across the datasets.

PARAGRAPH

HepCom score was compared with MELD and Child-Pugh scores, as well as with CirCom index, in order to demonstrate the superiority of the score.

HepCom score was superior to the other prognostic scores in both one- and two-year mortality (p <0.0001), showing a slightly better short- than mid-term survival prediction.

Also, HepCom score revealed the smallest Akaike’s information criterion value (Fig. 1).

SECTION

Validation of HepCom score

PARAGRAPH

The comparative C-index estimates for the validation data cohort are shown (Table 3), as are the results of the confirmatory analysis of the predictive ability of the HepCom score for one-year mortality (Fig. 1).

Compared to the MELD, Child-Pugh score, and CirCom index, the AUROCs estimated for the HepCom score were significantly higher and indicated a 10% to 20% improvement in the discrimination ability, confirming the concordance index estimates shown (Table 3).

For practical applications, we calculated sensitivity, specificity, NPV, PPV, and diagnostic likelihood ratios for two score thresholds to generate a low- and a high-risk group (Table S2).

In the estimation cohort, the cut-off ≤5.7 (low probability of mortality) correctly identified 90.8% (953/1,050) of individuals who were alive at two years of follow-up, while only 1.8% (n = 18) of individuals with a low probability of mortality were incorrectly diagnosed.

Thus, most of the patients who did not die could be accurately excluded with an NPV of 98.2%.

By contrast, when a cut-off ≥25 was applied, 29% (16/55) of individuals with two-year mortality were adequately identified, whereas 40.7% (n = 11) with a high probability of death were incorrectly classified.

Taking into account both cut-offs, the model was able to detect the presence or absence of two-year mortality in 87.8% (969/1,105) of patients with a correct prediction of 97.1% (969/998) of them.

The predictive performance of the model was evaluated using the same cut-offs in the validation cohort, demonstrating comparable results (Table 4).

PARAGRAPH

The Kaplan-Meier curves estimating one- and two-year mortality depending on the comorbidity-based model are shown for both estimation and validation cohorts (Fig. 2a and b).

We also repeated this analysis considering the appearance of one-and two-year relevant clinical events as the main outcome in these subsets (Fig. 3a and b).

SECTION

Influence of SVR on the HepCom score prediction

PARAGRAPH

Patients who achieved SVR had higher survival rates than those who did not achieve viral eradication.

The HepCom score was able to stratify the risk of mortality in both cured and non-cured patients, although those patients with SVR showed a better survival in each category (p <0.0001) (Fig. 4).

SECTION

Safety report

PARAGRAPH

During the study, the mortality was 5.4% (102/1,891).

Notably, 3.4% (65/1,891) of patients died within the first year of treatment.

Mortality occurred after a mean time of 10 ± 6.4 months (IQR 4.1–17.7 months), and 22.5% (23/102) of deaths occurred during treatment.

Leading causes of death were: cirrhosis complications (n = 40; 39.2%), infections (n = 20; 19.6%), heart disease (n = 13; 12.7%), non-liver tumors (n = 10; 9.8%), and respiratory processes (n = 8; 7.8%).

According to hepatic-related deaths, variceal bleeding (n = 12), HCC (n = 9), hepatic encephalopathy (n = 8), and acute-on-chronic liver failure (n = 5) were the most important causes of death.

Other patients died because of HBV reactivation during DAA treatment (n = 1), kidney failure (n = 2), gastroenterology diseases (n = 5) or complications related to neurology (n = 3) (Fig. 2).

We show the association between the comorbidities included in the Charlson index and mortality (Table S3).

PARAGRAPH

Relevant clinical events occurred in 18.5% (349/1,891) of patients within the first two years, while 38.9% (136/349) happened during treatment.

In addition, 2.9% (55/1,891) required DAA withdrawal.

Hospital admission was required in 71.9% (251/349) of patients suffering from relevant clinical events, while 14.6% (51/349) and 13.5% (47/349) of patients required a non-scheduled visit to the outpatient office or emergency room, respectively.

Episodes of hepatic decompensation were observed in 35.2% (123/349) of patients: variceal bleeding in 27 patients, ascites in 27 patients and hepatic encephalopathy in 22 patients.

Furthermore, three patients with portal vein thrombosis were observed.

Moreover, 37 patients required healthcare because of HCC.

Other gastroenterology outcomes (10.9%; 38/349) included acute pancreatitis (n = 3), cholecystitis (n = 5), appendicitis (n = 4) or diverticulitis (n = 1).

Severe infections were reported in 14.3% (50/349) of patients, including pneumonia (n = 14), septicemia (n = 11), acute herpes zoster virus infection (n = 11) and herpetic encephalitis (n = 1), perianal abscess (n = 3) and cellulitis in lower limbs (n = 4).

Kidney failure (4.6%; 16/349) and respiratory insufficiency (7.7%; 27/349) were reported as well.

Oncologic processes were responsible for 8% (28/349) of relevant clinical events (Fig. S3).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

With the advent of new HCV therapies, efforts have mostly been focussed on how to maximize SVR rates, to optimize the role of ribavirin,14 to develop the best strategy for special populations,15 and more recently to identify the role of DAA in fibrosis regression16 and HCC occurrence-recurrence.17–20

Recently, an MELD score ≥18 has been identified as a point-of-no-return in advanced liver disease (including decompensated cirrhosis) because of a higher risk of complications.21

However, these focuses are based on the liver disease.

At least 40% of patients with HCV diagnosis also have other disorders (comorbidities) that increase mortality.22

Obviously, the prognostic impacts of cancer, chronic kidney disease or atherosclerotic disease are known and expected.

Thus, the regular assessment of HCV’s burden of comorbidity is essential.

Our study reflects the importance of the evaluation of basal comorbidities in patients with HCV at the time of starting DAA therapy.

Combining Charlson index, age, and liver function (INR, albumin, and bilirubin), we were able to identify a very-high-risk group, likely to die or suffer from relevant clinical events within the first two years of DAA treatment.

In our opinion, antiviral therapy could be questionable for this subset of patients after the results of this study.

PARAGRAPH

Charlson index was developed in the 1980s to grade comorbidity (in a weighted manner), including 17 diseases, to determine the risk of one-year mortality.10

This score has been widely used for a lot of chronic diseases.

In liver cirrhosis, the CirCom index was developed in 2014 – it is simpler because it includes seven comorbidities11 that impact specifically on the clinical course of cirrhosis.

That the Charlson index is more accurate in our cohort makes sense, because the CirCom index does not include some comorbidities relevant to the natural history of HCV disease, such as diabetes mellitus or stroke.23

In addition, Charlson index grades liver disease in chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, while CirCom was designed specifically for cirrhosis.

PARAGRAPH

We aimed to evaluate the short- and mid-term mortality and relevant clinical events occurring in patients with HCV infection.

Arbitrarily, we conducted a one-year follow-up after the treatment, because we believe that 12 months is the minimum period to compensate the current cost of DAA therapy.

In addition, we extended the monitoring for two years to see whether the prediction was similar during this time.

Notably, the type of DAA therapy or use of ribavirin did not play any role in this study.

This large real-world cohort gives information about one- (3.4%) and two-year mortality (5.4%), as well as relevant clinical events (about 20%), from starting HCV treatment.

Interestingly, 23 of 102 (22.5%) deaths and 136 of 349 (38.9%) relevant clinical events occurred during the (8-, 12- or 24-week) course of the antiviral therapy.

Also, only one-third of deaths and clinical events were related to hepatic complications; which means that almost 70% suffered from extrahepatic events during the follow-up.

This fact reinforces the importance of bearing in mind all basal comorbidities, irrespective of liver disease in patients with HCV.

PARAGRAPH

Combining Charlson index, age, and liver function (albumin, INR, and bilirubin), we were able to identify different subsets of patients at risk of suffering relevant outcomes within 24 months of starting DAA therapy.

This combination includes some variables classically related to prognosis in cirrhotic patients (albumin, bilirubin and INR, belonging to Child-Pugh and MELD scores) and others whose impact is evident on survival rates, although they are not usually included in prognostic liver scores (age and comorbidities).

On the one hand, a HepCom score cut-off ≤5.7 revealed a group of patients with only a 1% and 3% chance of one- and two-year mortality, respectively, while patients with a score ≥25 suffered had a 50% and 60% chance of one- and two-year mortality, respectively (more than ten times higher than the overall cohort).

Furthermore, using both cut-offs, the high-risk group showed a 75–80% occurence of relevant clinical events, while only 15–20% of the low-risk group experiences such events.

At this point, two strengths must be highlighted: a) one- and two-year outcomes were very similar in both independent estimation and validation cohorts, reinforcing the robustness of the data; b) HepCom score is easy to perform and calculate by clinicians because it comprises routine laboratory parameters for these patients (albumin, bilirubin, INR), age and a summation of comorbidities (collected in electronic records), which are gathered in each outpatient office.

Thus, this pragmatic algorithm enabled identification of three risk groups (including an intermediate-risk group) that demonstrated different monthly and cumulative incidence rates of mortality and relevant clinical events from the first month to the final month of follow-up.

Therefore, the HepCom score should be the first step in the management of patients with HCV requiring antiviral therapy, because it can help to balance the risks and benefits of the treatment.

PARAGRAPH

This study has some limitations.

Firstly, the relatively low absolute death rate during the follow-up.

There were two expected reasons for the low mortality in our study: a) the follow-up probably was not long enough (two years), because it was determined to find the short-term benefit of the DAA therapy to help to select the adequate candidates; b) the population included theoretically had a low risk of short-term mortality, because cirrhotic patients showed a good liver function predominantly (Child-Pugh A 82%) and non-cirrhotic patients represented 40% of the overall cohort.

The impact of SVR (following IFN-based therapy) on liver-unrelated-events has been extensively evaluated, showing a reduced incidence of most outcomes.9

However, this effect appears to be influenced by the time that antiviral therapy is initiated.

Notably, the early initiation is required for glomerulonephritis, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and stroke.24

The current study was not designed to demonstrate the influence of DAA on the incidence of extrahepatic manifestations.

There was a lack of comparison with a historical IFN-treated cohort, and the follow-up was too short for this purpose.

However, we observed that achieving SVR was related to higher survival rates in the three HepCom-based risk groups (even in the worst scenario).

Therefore, we can deduct the benefit of the eradication of the virus in both liver-related and -unrelated events.

PARAGRAPH

This real-world study could have significant consequences for clinicians in daily clinical practice and the healthcare system.

Firstly, the cost of treatment based on DAA has emerged as an important concern, not only in most cost-sensitive countries but also in developed countries.25

It is estimated that HCV affects over 185 million individuals worldwide (about 3% of the world's population).

These two circumstances make it necessary to develop and implement effective strategies for controlling the high costs of managing patients with HCV.26

Secondly, the huge number of patients that have suddenly come to the outpatient office could collapse the healthcare system because of the frequency of follow-up visits (creating a barrier to care27).

Current EASL guidelines5 recommend monitoring treatment efficacy by RNA levels and monitoring treatment safety at baseline, between week two and four (optional), at end-of-treatment, and 12 or 24 weeks after the end of therapy.

Taken together, the implementation of a tool, like HepCom score, may be useful because: a) it could help to identify those patients who will not show a short- or mid-term benefit from DAA therapy, saving the cost and redirecting it to people who will benefit; b) it could distinguish patients who need be monitored more frequently (high-risk group) from those who could be seen later (low-risk group) and, thus, be relevant for reorganizing outpatient offices.

PARAGRAPH

According to EASL and AASLD recommendations, all patients with HCV infection could have access to treatment with the exclusion of those with a reduced life expectancy for non-liver-related conditions.

Thus, the HepCom Study provides a new tool to stratify patients with HCV based on prognosis, beyond of the eradication of the virus.

The combination of Charlson index, age, and liver function (INR, albumin, and bilirubin) enables detection of a group at a high risk of mortality and relevant clinical events after starting direct-acting antiviral therapy, who should be considered very carefully for treatment.

In this setting, the HepCom score appears to identify patients in whom the overall prognosis is too short, even if SVR is achieved, rather than detecting an insufficiently high absolute benefit of the DAA therapy.

Therefore, it could help in concentrating the health care efforts (either economic or monitoring) to patients with hepatitis C who are more likely to benefit from these treatments.
