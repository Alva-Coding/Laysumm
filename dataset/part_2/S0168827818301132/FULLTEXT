TITLE

Outcome of ABO-incompatible adult living-donor liver transplantation for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Although several potentially curative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are known, such as liver resection and local ablation, HCC is difficult to manage, because the tumor mostly develops on a background of cirrhosis, and the limited functional reserves of the liver making their use difficult.1

In recent years, liver transplantation (LT) has generally been considered a feasible treatment capable of simultaneously curing HCC and the underlying liver cirrhosis, with living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) performed on select patients with HCC as a practical alternative to deceased-donor liver transplantation (DDLT).2–4

However, many patients with HCC who may benefit from long-term survival through LT still do not have a chance of transplantation due to a lack of organs, especially in Asia where HCC incidence combined with chronic HBV- and HCV-related liver diseases is high.5

PARAGRAPH

We have previously investigated the feasibility and clinical outcomes of ABO-incompatible (ABOi) LDLT, finding that the use of living ABOi liver donors is a very effective and safe method for expanding the donor pool for LDLT without an additional donor risk.6,7

In practice and in countries with an extreme scarcity of deceased-donor organs, liver donations from living ABOi donors have been widely accepted as a viable option for patients with end-stage liver disease or HCC and for whom an ABO-compatible (ABOc) donor is unavailable.8,9

PARAGRAPH

Recently, as selection criteria for recipients of LDLT for HCC are expanded, the demand for ABOi LDLT is increasing in patients with unresectable HCC with a cirrhotic liver, and the need for evaluating the oncological outcome of ABOi LDLT for HCC is increasing.

However, thus far, no studies investigating the oncological safety and feasibility of ABOi LDLT for HCC are available.

The primary aims of our study were to review our experiences with ABOi LDLT and evaluate the relative feasibility of ABOi LDLT for HCC treatment, by comparing the HCC-related survival outcomes in the ABOi and ABOc groups.

SECTION

Materials and methods

PARAGRAPH

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 918 patients who underwent adult LDLT for HCC between November 2008 and December 2015 at the Asan Medical Center (Seoul, South Korea).

Among these patients, 165 recipients underwent ABOi LDLT for HCC.

Surgical procedures and techniques were undertaken per standard clinical practice, with equal numbers of subjects in the ABOi and ABOc groups.10

The primary endpoint was the comparison of overall patient’s and HCC recurrence-free survival rate between the ABOi and ABOc groups.

Secondary endpoints included the comparison of HCC recurrence patterns between the two groups.

SECTION

The selection criteria for ABOi LDLT for HCC

PARAGRAPH

The selection criteria for ABOi and ABOc LDLT for HCC were the same, without any specific criteria for ABOi LDLT that were associated with HCC progression.

Our institutional eligibility criteria for HCC (the Asan criteria) include tumor size ≤5 cm, tumor number ≤6, and no gross vascular invasion.11

Even when the patient exhibited HCC that did not meet the Asan criteria, the patient was assigned to a high-risk recurrence group, and proceeded with LT after downstaging, allowing for a sufficient warning of HCC recurrence after LT. On the other hand, we excluded LT in patients with extrahepatic metastasis or macrovascular invasion.

With respect to the preoperative condition of the patients, the application of ABOi LDLT in patients with a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score above 30 was infrequent at the beginning of the ABOi LDLT program.

These days, however, ABOi LDLT is also applied to patients with high MELD scores, with no specific criteria associated with the preoperative condition.

However, we only evaluated ABOi donor candidates if ABOc candidates were unavailable.

SECTION

Protocol for preoperative preparation and immunosuppression

PARAGRAPH

For ABOi recipients, the desensitization protocol for overcoming the ABO blood group barrier included pretransplant rituximab (RTX) administration and plasma exchange (PE).

Regardless of the pretransplant patient condition, the same dose of RTX was given to all patients two to three weeks before LT. From November 2008 to April 2010, an RTX dose of 375 mg/m2/body surface area (BSA) was used, whereas thereafter a dose of 300 mg/m2/BSA was used.

No special drugs or induction regimens other than RTX were used.

PE was performed with blood-type AB fresh frozen plasma.

The frequency and timing of PE depended upon the hemagglutinin (HA) titer with the goal of achieving an antibody titer of ≤1:8 prior to LT. Intravenous methylprednisolone (10 mg/kg body weight) was administered just prior to reperfusion.

A more detailed description of the desensitization protocol for ABOi adult LDLT performed in our hospital has already been published.6,12

PARAGRAPH

All patients in the ABOi and ABOc groups used the same immunosuppressive regimen comprised of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (500 mg twice daily), and steroids.

Steroids were tapered over the three-month period following LDLT.

Immunosuppression after LDLT was tailored according to the recipients’ condition and the graft function regardless of the tumor etiology.

SECTION

Monitoring of antibody-mediated rejection and postoperative follow-up

PARAGRAPH

To monitor antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), the HA titer and the proportion of CD20+ lymphocytes were measured before the preoperative preparation.

During the first week after LT, the HA titer and the proportion of CD20+ lymphocytes were checked daily.

Both CD20+ lymphocytes and the prevalence of peripheral-blood lymphocyte subpopulations, including CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells, and CD16+ CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells, were measured twice weekly while the patients were hospitalized, weekly until one-month post-surgery, and monthly thereafter.

If the HA titer was elevated >1:32, PE was performed along with an augmented immunosuppressive regimen.

No additional doses of RTX were administered.

SECTION

Monitoring HCC recurrence and postoperative follow-up

PARAGRAPH

All LDLT recipients were followed up periodically by measuring tumor markers (serum alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], and protein induced by vitamin K absence/antagonist-II [PIVKA-II]), and by performing chest x-rays, and dynamic liver computed tomography (CT) scans.

CT scans were performed every three months during the first year and every four months or six months thereafter, depending on the patient, up to three years after LT. If a patient was suspected of recurrent HCC based on the above-mentioned tests, chest CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomographic (PET)–CT imaging were additionally performed.

Recurrence was defined as typical CT/magnetic resonance imaging features at follow-up, but biopsy was performed in some cases when it was difficult to diagnose HCC recurrence by imaging tests only.

Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was defined as the time between the date of transplantation and the date of the first imaging study identifying recurrent disease.

SECTION

Ethical considerations

PARAGRAPH

Each transplantation procedure was evaluated and approved by the local authorities and the Korean Network for Organ Sharing affiliated with the Ministry of Health and Welfare of the Republic of Korea, and this study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of our institution (approval number: 2016-1303).

The study protocol conforms to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki as reflected in a priori approval by the institution's human research committee.

The requirement for informed consent was waived owing to the retrospective nature of the study.

SECTION

Statistical analyses

PARAGRAPH

Descriptive statistics were presented as means and standard deviations or percentages, and patient characteristics were compared using t tests, Mann-Whitney tests, and chi-square tests.

The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to analyze the RFS and overall survival (OS) rates of the patients, and all were computed as the time from the transplant to HCC recurrence.

Propensity score matching was performed with Greedy matching, using a caliper of 0.2 standard deviations of the log of the propensity score.

The absolute standardized differences method was used to diagnose the balance after matching.

All absolute standardized differences after matching were <0.25.

In the propensity score-matched cohort, the risks of survival were compared using a Cox regression model with robust standard errors, which accounted for the clustering of matched pairs.

SECTION

Survival outcomes of ABOi LDLT for HCC

PARAGRAPH

Between November 2008 and December 2015, 165 patients underwent ABOi adult LDLT for HCC at the Asan Medical Center.

None of the patients who were preparing for ABOi LDLT for HCC failed to undergo ABOi LDLT for reasons related to the desensitization process.

Patients who received ABOi LDLT had a mean recipient age of 53.4 ± 7.0 years and included 137 (83.0%) males.

The most common cause of cirrhosis was HBV (n = 139; 84.2%), followed by HCV (n = 11; 6.7%).

The mean MELD score was 10.5 ± 4.5.

Blood-type combinations between donors and recipients included A to B (n = 16), A to O (n = 52), B to A (n = 21), B to O (n = 38), AB to B (n = 15), AB to A (n = 20), and AB to O (n = 6).

PARAGRAPH

Regarding tumor characteristics, 136 (82.4%) of 165 ABOi LDLT recipients met the Milan criteria based on pretransplant imaging.

The mean preoperative AFP was 211.5 ng/ml ± 1,575.7, and the mean preoperative PIVKA-II was 108.5 ± 317.8.

On explant-pathology examination, the mean tumor number was 1.8 ± 2.5, and the mean size of the largest tumor nodule was 2.1 ± 1.9 cm in the ABOi groups.

PARAGRAPH

The baseline characteristics of the 165 ABOi and 753 ABOc recipients at the time of LT are shown (Table 1).

Significant differences were found with respect to HCC status (HCC number, total sum of viable HCC diameters, maximum diameter of viable HCC) on pretransplant images, the percentage of recipients who met the Milan criteria based on pretransplant imaging, the percentage of HCC patients showing hypermetabolic lesions upon preoperative 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET, the percentage of patients with Child’s C cirrhosis, the (MELD) score, and the total sum of existing HCC diameters on explant livers between patients in the ABOi and non-ABOi groups.

Except for these aspects, no statistically significant differences were observed between patients in the two groups and HCC characteristics at transplant.

PARAGRAPH

In a total of 34 patients, IA titers were increased to ≥1:64, and 18 patients (52.9%) showed elevated liver enzyme levels or a 2–3-fold increase from the baseline in total bilirubin levels.

Biopsies were performed in 34 patients with suspected AMR, but only one patient displayed typical histologic findings of AMR.

All 34 patients were affected by PE, as IA titers were reduced to less than 1:32 and liver function was stabilized.

However, diffuse intrahepatic biliary stricture (DIHBS), one of the typical clinical manifestations of AMR, subsequently occurred in four of these patients.

In addition to these patients, DIHBS also occurred in six patients without a history of elevated IA titers, and finally, AMR in the form of DIHBS was diagnosed in 10 patients (6.0%) in the ABOi group.

Of the 10 patients with DIHBS, one died without retransplantation and one died after re-LT (DDLT), two were alive after re-LT (DDLT), and six were alive with a well-functioning graft.

PARAGRAPH

In the ABOi LDLT group, the median follow-up duration was 48.0 months (range: 12.6–99.0 months), and the one-, three-, and five-year OS rates were 96.4%, 89.0%, and 86.0%, respectively, whereas the one-, three-, and five-year RFS rates of the patients were 91.4%, 85.7%, and 81.5%, respectively.

This result was comparable with that observed in the ABOc LDLT group (p = 0.166 and p = 0.578) (Fig. 1A and B).

PARAGRAPH

Among patients who underwent ABOi LDLT, 29 of 165 (17.6%) were outside of the Milan criteria as compared with 206 of 753 patients (27.4%) in the ABOc LDLT group.

(p = 0.009) Among patients not fulfilling the Milan criteria, the comparison of OS and RFS rates revealed no statistically significant differences (p = 0.490 and p = 0.444) (Fig. 2A and B).

SECTION

ABOi LDLT vs. ABOc LDLT for HCC: propensity score-matched analysis

PARAGRAPH

To avoid existing selection biases and eliminate confounding factors, propensity score matching was performed at a 1:1 ratio, resulting in 330 patients being enrolled in this study (165 patients per group).

Patient clinicopathological data for both groups are summarized in Table 2.

After matching, there were no significant differences between the two groups regarding recipient background factors and tumor characteristics including pathology of HCC on explant livers.

Patients (114; 69.1%) in each group had a history of locoregional therapies for HCC before transplantation.

The proportions of patients treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, radiation therapy, or surgery were not significantly different between the ABOi and ABOc groups.

Regarding preoperative tumor characteristics, the proportion of patients outside the Milan criteria did not differ significantly between the two groups, and no significant differences were observed between the groups with regard to preoperative tumor-marker levels and the proportion of patients who exhibited hypermetabolic lesions on preoperative 18F-FDG-PET.

PARAGRAPH

When comparing perioperative morbidity, 15 patients (9.0%) suffered from biopsy-proven acute cellular rejection (BPAR) in the ABOi group, and no significant differences in the incidence of BPAR were observed between the ABOi and ABOc groups (9.0% vs. 9.7%, p = 0.718).

AMR occurred in 10 patients (6.1%) in the ABOi group, whereas no patients suffered from AMR in the ABOc group.

The incidence of biliary stricture in the ABOi group was 20.0%, higher than in the ABOc group (11.5%, p <0.001).

Moreover, the incidence of infectious complications was 10.3%, and was higher in the ABOi group, but not statistically significant (p = 0.974) (Table 3).

PARAGRAPH

The median follow-up duration of 330 patients was 51.0 months (range: 12.2–99.3 months), and the mean time from HCC diagnosis to transplantation was 24.9 ± 39.2 months and 26.0 ± 37.3 months for the ABOi and ABOc groups, respectively (p = 0.842).

The overall patient survival at one, three, and five years was 96.4%, 89.0%, and 86.0% for ABOi LDLT recipients and 97.6%, 90.0%, and 86.9% for ABOc LDLT recipients, respectively (p = 0.449) (Fig. 3A).

PARAGRAPH

The main cause of mortality after transplantation was tumor recurrence.

Twenty-six (15.8%) of the patients developed a recurrent tumor at a median of 10.1 months (range: 2.3–49.1 months) after ABOi LDLT.

Moreover, 23 of 165 (15.2%) patients presented tumor recurrence at a median of 10.0 months (range: 1.4–53.2 months) after ABOc LDLT.

The overall one-, three-, and five-year recurrence-free rates were 91.4%, 85.7%, and 81.5% after ABOi LDLT and 91.5%, 88.4%, and 82.0% after ABOc LDLT, respectively (p = 0.630) (Fig. 3B).

The most common sites for tumor recurrence were the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, and, rarely, the bone or brain.

Following ABOi LDLT, the majority of recurrences were extrahepatic, with 61.5% occurring in extrahepatic sites only, 15.4% in intrahepatic sites only, and 23.1% in both sites.

There was no difference in the recurrence sites between the two groups (p = 1.000) (Table 3), and no significant differences were observed in the OS rates after tumor recurrence (p = 0.397) (Fig. S1).

SECTION

Risk factors for HCC recurrence

PARAGRAPH

The results of univariate and multivariate analyses of factors associated with HCC recurrence for the entire cohort are shown (Table 4).

In the univariate analysis, ABO incompatibility was not an independent predictive factor for HCC recurrence.

In the multivariate analysis, the PIVKA-II levels at transplant, the 18F-FDG uptake evaluated by preoperative PET scans, satisfying Milan criteria, the presence of microvascular invasion, and a history of HCC treatment before LT were independent risk factors for HCC recurrence.

However, the multivariate analysis demonstrated that ABO incompatibility was not a risk factor for HCC recurrence, either.

SECTION

Kinetics of lymphocyte subpopulations in ABOi LT recipients

PARAGRAPH

Following RTX treatment two to three weeks before LT, CD20+ B cells were eliminated, with percentages verified as having decreased to almost zero.

The number of CD20+ B cells was suppressed during the first three months post-surgery, after which their numbers gradually increased.

However, CD20+ B cell numbers were generally suppressed as compared with those observed prior to RTX treatment, with this suppression observed for as long as one year.

(Fig. 4A) Our findings showed that the CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell subpopulations were also altered following RTX administration.

The percentage of total CD3+ T cells increased along with the RTX-induced decrease in CD20+ B cells, followed by a gradual decrease in the percentage of total CD3+ T cells to levels observed prior to RTX treatment one year later.

The percentage of CD4+ T cells increased following RTX treatment until the first week post-surgery, followed by a decrease.

By contrast, the percentage of CD8+ T cells increased following RTX treatment during the first three-months post-surgery (Fig. 4B).

Additionally, the percentage of CD16+ CD56+ NK cells in the peripheral blood decreased during the first four-weeks post-surgery and especially during the first week, followed by a subsequent restoration to preoperative levels (Fig. 4A).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

LT has become widely accepted as an established treatment for patients with HCC, achieving the complete removal of pre-neoplastic lesions and underlying liver cirrhosis.

The number of patients with HCC in need of transplantation has increased worldwide along with the progressive increase in HCC incidence and proposals for expanded criteria to allow more patients to benefit from LT.13–16 Although DDLT is considered the ideal treatment, when there is a shortage of available deceased donors, LDLT has been determined as a practical alternative for patients with HCC in order to compensate for the lack of donor organs and reduce the dropout rate on the waiting list.17–19,4

However, due to the limitations of LDLT such as the lack of donor voluntarism and donor-selection criteria, a shortage of organs persists, and the demand for ABOi LDLT for patients with HCC continues to increase.9

PARAGRAPH

ABOi LDLT has long been considered a high-risk surgery, due to its association with high incidence of AMR, bile-duct and vascular complications.20,21

However, the outcomes of ABOi LDLT have improved remarkably since 2000 due to the implementation of various strategies, including RTX administration and PE, and ABOi LDLT has been generally accepted as a feasible treatment option for cases with no available ABOc donor.22,23

The ABOi adult LDLT program at our institution has also been boosted by the excellent outcomes associated with such improvements in strategy.6,12

The proportion of ABOi LDLT cases continues to rise, with this procedure now accounting for >20% of the annual number of LDLTs performed at our institution since 2012.

The excellent results of ABOi LDLT at our institution have been described previously.7,24

PARAGRAPH

Despite some concerns that the desensitization protocol for breaking through the ABO blood group barrier, such as the RTX treatment, might have a negative impact on HCC recurrence,25,26 as the outcome of ABOi LDLT improves the number of recipients of ABOi LDLT for the treatment of HCC continues to increase.

As the usage of ABOi LDLT for HCC treatment grows, the impact of the outcome of ABOi LDLT on the recipient, as compared to that of ABOc LDLT, and especially the subsequent HCC recurrence following LT, have become important topics for debate.

PARAGRAPH

The results of this study suggested that ABOi LDLT offers an acceptable opportunity for and duration of survival to patients who would soon die from untreatable liver failure or HCC, when receiving conventional treatments.

Because patients with unfulfilled Milan criteria were included in the study, the rate of HCC recurrence in our study was 15.2%; although somewhat higher, this rate indicated an acceptable result relative to the rates reported in the literature.27,28

Furthermore, previous studies postulated that any possible recurrence could be more aggressive in the ABOi LT group due to the large doses of immunosuppressive agents,25,29,30 however, it was notable that the incidence of extrahepatic recurrences and intrahepatic recurrences were similar between ABOi LT group and ABOc LT groups, indicating that desensitization protocol for ABOi LT did not influence the pattern and incidence of HCC recurrence in this study.

In addition, our findings revealed no significant differences in OS after recurrence (p = 0.397) (Fig. S1).

PARAGRAPH

Contrary to our findings, previous studies have suggested the possibility of worse oncological outcomes among ABOi recipients, because most ABOi liver recipients undergo more intense immunomodulatory protocols to overcome the ABO blood-type barrier, including anti-CD20 treatment and plasmapheresis and/or splenectomy.25,31

In practice, desensitization protocols cause changes in B cell, T cell, and anti-blood-type isoagglutinin titers, with previous reports describing these changes;31–34 however, to date, there have been few studies linking these changes to the risk of HCC recurrence.

In this study, we have also identified changes in serum composition, but these were not enough to explain the association with HCC recurrence.

A well-designed clinical trial in a large, unique cohort of recipients is needed to confirm the lymphocyte kinetics and define any clinical significance related to these differences, as well as the relationships between these differences and HCC recurrence.

PARAGRAPH

Although the Milan criteria are still accepted as a standard for selecting transplant candidates for HCC, many transplant centers have performed LT using extended criteria beyond the Milan criteria with acceptable outcomes, especially in the era of LDLT.35,36

If ABOi LDLT stability is proven for the treatment of HCC and the application becomes more prevalent, this could offer more patients an opportunity for long-term survival.

However, given the inconclusive nature of data concerning the impact of the desensitization protocol on HCC recurrence and clinical results associated with ABOi LDLT for HCC, it may seem too early to apply the same extended criteria currently used for ABOc LDLT.

Actually, our results show that although the RFS and OS rates did not show statistically significant differences between the two groups, lower RFS and OS rates were found in the ABOi LDLT group.

(Fig. 2A and B) Therefore, a further risk-benefit analysis is required to apply the same extended criteria currently used for ABOc LDLT.

In addition to patient selection, the postoperative use of immunosuppressants should be exercised more prudently for patients with advanced HCC undergoing ABOi LDLT for HCC.

PARAGRAPH

This study has the following limitations: 1) these results may not be applicable to advanced HCC, because >70% of the patients in this study had early HCC adhering to the Milan criteria; and 2) our data on the kinetics of recipient lymphocyte subpopulations were insufficient to clearly address the clinical question.

Currently, no data on the kinetics of lymphocyte subpopulations of ABOc LT recipients is available for comparison with a control group.

However, this study has sufficient value, because studies on ABOi LT for HCC are currently ongoing at several transplant centers, and few centers have reported their experience with ABOi LT for HCC treatment.

Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, our investigation utilized the largest number of cases as a representative sample for the study.

PARAGRAPH

Despite hypothetical immunological concerns, our experience demonstrated no significant differences in long-term OS and RFS rates between patients receiving ABOc or ABOi LTs, with four-fifths of patients meeting Milan criteria at transplantation.

In conclusion, results from our institution indicated that ABOi LDLT constitutes a potentially feasible option for patients with HCC, especially those with compensated cirrhosis with HCC within conventional Milan criteria; however, further efforts should be made to demonstrate how desensitization protocols for crossing the ABO blood-type barrier affect HCC, and more research is required to develop a more secure and effective desensitization protocol from an oncological perspective.
