ABSTRACT

TITLE

Outcome of ABO-incompatible adult living-donor liver transplantation for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma

PARAGRAPH

Living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) can simultaneously cure hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and underlying liver cirrhosis, improving long-term results in patients with HCC.

ABO-incompatible LDLT could expand the living-donor pool, reduce waiting times for deceased-donor liver transplantation, and improve long-term survival for some patients with HCC.

PARAGRAPH

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients undergoing LDLT for HCC from November 2008 to December 2015 at a single institution in Korea.

In total, 165 patients underwent ABO-incompatible and 753 patients underwent ABO-compatible LDLT for HCC.

ABO-incompatible recipients underwent desensitization to overcome the ABO blood group barrier, including pretransplant plasma exchange and rituximab administration (300–375 mg/m2 /body surface area).

PARAGRAPH

We performed 1:1 propensity score matching and included 165 patients in each group.

82.4% of ABO-incompatible and 83.0% of -compatible LDLT groups had HCC within conventional Milan criteria, respectively, and 92.1% and 92.7% of patients in each group had a Child-Pugh score of A or B. ABO-incompatible and -compatible LDLT groups were followed up for 48.0 and 48.7 months, respectively, with both groups showing comparable recurrence-free survival rates (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14; 95% CI 0.68–1.90; p = 0.630) and overall patient-survival outcomes (HR 1.10; 95% CI 0.60–2.00; p = 0.763).

PARAGRAPH

These findings suggested that ABO-incompatible liver transplantation is a feasible option for patients with HCC, especially for those with compensated cirrhosis with HCC within conventional Milan criteria.
