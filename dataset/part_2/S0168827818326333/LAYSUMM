TITLE

Association between physical activity and risk of hepatobiliary cancers: A multinational cohort study

PARAGRAPH

In a pan-European study of 467,336 men and women, we found that physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of developing liver cancers over the next decade.

This risk was independent of other liver cancer risk factors, and did not vary by age, gender, smoking status, body weight, and alcohol consumption.
