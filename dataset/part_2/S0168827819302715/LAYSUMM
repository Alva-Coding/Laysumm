TITLE

Efficient long-term amplification of hepatitis B virus isolates after infection of slow proliferating HepG2-NTCP cells

PARAGRAPH

Currently available laboratory systems are unable to reproduce the dynamics of hepatitis B virus (HBV) spread through the infected liver and release into the blood.

We developed a slowly dividing liver-derived cell line which multiplies infectious viral particles upon inoculation with patient- or cell culture-derived HBV.

This new infection model can improve therapy by measuring, in advance, the sensitivity of a patientâ€™s HBV strain to specific antiviral drugs.
