TITLE

Urea cycle dysregulation in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Alarming increases in the rates of obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in an ageing population, have made liver disease a major public health concern for the next decade.1,2

NAFLD is a spectrum of liver diseases ranging from steatosis, through non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to cirrhosis.3

Recently, NASH has been defined as a “multiple parallel hits” disease4 that can progress to liver fibrosis, which is the principal factor contributing to NASH-associated morbidity and mortality.5,6

The main cell type responsible for extracellular matrix deposition is hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which undergo activation in conditions of frank hepatocellular injury, enabling them to participate in the wound healing process7 and making them key in the development of fibrosis.

PARAGRAPH

The urea cycle, located exclusively in the liver, has evolved in humans to remove ammonia.

The enzymes involved in this process are carbamoylphosphate synthetase (CPS1), ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) and arginase (ARG), but only the first two are present in the mitochondria.8

In NASH, many lines of investigation indicate that mitochondria are dysfunctional.9

Therefore, it is possible that the resultant mitochondrial injury leads to a modification of the OTC and CPS1 genes, reducing their expression and function, and resulting in hyperammonemia.

Accordingly, in an experimental diet-induced NASH model, we demonstrated that the gene and protein expression of OTC and CPS1 were reduced significantly, resulting in a functional reduction in the in vivo capacity for ureagenesis.10

This impairs nitrogen homeostasis and results in hyperammonemia.

PARAGRAPH

We have recently demonstrated that pathological ammonia concentrations produce changes in human HSC behaviour, including significant alterations in cellular morphology, reactive oxygen species production and further HSC activation.11

Removal of ammonia from the cell cultures restored HSC morphology and function towards normality indicating that the changes in the HSCs induced by ammonia are reversible.11

These in vitro data were substantiated in bile duct-ligated rats with advanced fibrosis and hyperammonemia, where treatment with the ammonia lowering drug ornithine-phenylacetate significantly reduced plasma ammonia, markers of HSC activation and portal pressure, indicating that targeting ammonia in vivo reduces HSC activation.11

PARAGRAPH

The aims of this study were to determine if reduced gene and protein expression, and function of urea cycle enzymes (UCEs) induced hyperammonemia in an animal model of NASH, and also to determine if this process was reversible by restoring the diet.

To confirm the animal data, we determined plasma and liver ammonia levels, as well as OTC expression and activity in liver biopsies from patients with NAFLD.

To investigate the potential mechanism underlying these changes, the methylation status of UCEs’ promoter regions were assessed both in rats and humans.

In vitro studies were also performed in primary rat hepatocytes, with induced steatosis.

Materials and methods

SECTION

Animal study

PARAGRAPH

Female Wistar rats (body weight 200–220 g; Taconic M&B, Ejby, Denmark) were housed at 21 ± 2 °C with a 12 h artificial light cycle.

Three animals were housed in each cage with free access to tap water.

All animals were allowed to acclimatise on a standard diet for a week followed by randomisation.

Half of the rats were fed a standard diet (D12450J) and the other half a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet (HFHC) diet (D09052204) ad libitum (both from Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA).

The standard diet was composed of the following energy sources: 67 g carbohydrates (70 kcal%), 4 g fat (10 kcal%), and 19 g protein (20 kcal%) per 100 g diet.

The HFHC diet contained 19 g carbohydrates (15 kcal%), 39 g fat (65 kcal%), 2 g cholesterol, and 27 g protein (20 kcal%) per 100 g diet.

The study was performed in accordance with local and national guidelines for animal welfare and approved by the institutional Animal Ethics Committee.

PARAGRAPH

Design.

Thirty animals were divided into five groups: two receiving standard diet and two HFHC diet for 10 and 12 months, respectively.

The fifth group received HFHC diet for 10 months and was then changed back to normal diet for two months.

After an overnight 12 h fast the animals were anaesthetised with a subcutaneous injection of fentanyl/fluanisone (Hypnorm®, Jansen Pharma, Birkerød, Denmark) at 0.5 ml × kg−1 and midazolam (Dormicum®, La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) at 2.5 mg × kg−1.

All blood was collected for analyses.

The liver and spleen were weighed and slices of liver tissue from the left lobe were secured, fixed overnight in 10% buffered formalin and embedded the next day in paraffin.

Sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and Sirius Red for histological examination.

Additionally, 200 mg of liver tissue was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C.

The following variables were determined in plasma: bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, glucose, total cholesterol and triglycerides concentrations.

In liver tissue, we determined triglycerides, mRNA levels of the UCEs Cps1, Otc, Ass, Asl and Arg; protein expression of CPS1 and OTC; enzyme activity of OTC, global methylation and methylation of the promoter of the Otc gene.

PARAGRAPH

Liver histology.

All histology specimens were reviewed by an experienced liver histopathologist (SHD) blinded to the clinical and laboratory data.

Histological parameters were scored according to standard criteria.12

PARAGRAPH

Blood analyses.

Plasma ALT, bilirubin, albumin, glucose, total cholesterol and triglycerides were determined by routine analytical methods.

All of the assays used in this study had been validated for use in rats.

PARAGRAPH

Liver tissue analyses: Triglycerides.

Triglycerides were determined using a Triglyceride Colorimetric Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (please refer to the Supplementary section for more detailed information).

PARAGRAPH

Real-time qPCR.

Total RNA from whole liver tissues was extracted using QIAzol Lysis Reagent and RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (please refer to the Supplementary section for more detailed information).

PARAGRAPH

Western blot analysis.

Proteins from rat liver tissue were homogenised and protein content was determined by the microBCA assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol as described in the Supplementary section.

PARAGRAPH

OTC enzyme activity.

To determine the OTC activity, 10 µg of total protein from human and rat livers was adjusted to 100 µl with water.

In brief, samples were incubated in the presence of excessive amounts of l-ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate under optimal enzyme conditions (triethanolamine solution).

The enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding a phosphoric acid/sulfuric acid mixture (3:1) and incubating with 3% chromogenic reagent 2,3-butanedione monoxime.

The rate of citrulline production was assessed spectrophotometrically at 490 nm (please refer to the Supplementary section for more detailed information).

PARAGRAPH

Methylation assay.

DNA was isolated from liver tissue using the FitAMP™ DNA isolation kit (P-1003, Epigenetek, Farmingdale, NY, USA).

One hundred nanograms of purified DNA was used to assess global methylation using MethylFlash™ Global DNA Methylation (5-mC) ELISA Easy Kit (P-1034, Epigentek) according to the manufacturer’s protocols.

Moreover, to investigate whether the Otc promoter was among the methylated regions in HFHC-fed rats, the entire coding sequence of the rat Otc gene (Rat - Chromosome X: 13,524,607–13,601,069, reverse strand – Ensemble - ENSRNOT00000004686.3) was screened for CpG islands and putative promoter region using the web interfaces of Ensemble and Promoter 2.0 prediction server.

Because of the low-GC content of the genomic regions, the EpiJET™ DNA Methylation Analysis Kit (Thermo Scientific) was employed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Briefly, 0.4 µg purified genomic DNA was incubated at 60 °C for 1 h with either Epi HpyF30I or Epi TaqI, isoschizomers with TCGA specificity, or left undigested, followed by incubation at 90 °C for 10 min.

Methylation of cytosine in the TCGA blocks cleavage with Epi HpyF30I but does not affect cleavage with Epi TaqI.

Primers for qPCR analysis (Table S1) were designed using NCBI Primer-BLAST13 in such a way that amplicons flank/cover the TCGA site, and by taking into account the few data reported in the literature.14–16

Sequences are numerated upstream of the ATG codon.

Real-time qPCR was performed using Maxima™ SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific) with a two-step cycling protocol for 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 60 s at 60 °C.

SECTION

Human studies

PARAGRAPH

Subjects, study design and ethics.

In humans, we obtained liver biopsies from 20 patients with steatosis and 15 patients with NASH admitted to the Digestive Unit, Valencia, Spain for bariatric surgery.

All the patients were operated on by the same surgical team and underwent the identical bariatric intervention, a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.

Patients were included if they were between 18 and 75 years of age.

The diagnosis was established by clinical and biochemical findings, and verified by liver biopsy.

The patients’ baseline characteristics and standard biochemistry have previously been published as part of other studies.17,18

PARAGRAPH

We measured blood ammonia levels, liver function tests, markers of metabolic syndrome and C-reactive protein (CRP).

In liver tissue, OTC, glutamine synthetase (GS) and cytokeratin (CK)-19 protein levels and OTC enzyme activity, ammonia concentrations, and methylation status of the CPS1 and OTC promoter genes were determined.

PARAGRAPH

Four age-matched patients undergoing liver resection for colorectal metastasis with no history of liver disease were included as controls (mean age 63 (range 53–73) years; mean body mass index (BMI) 27 ± 5 kg/m2, ALT 28 ± 12 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 23 ± 4 U/L, bilirubin 10 ± 4 μmol/L, international normalized ratio (INR) 1.1 ± 0.1, normal glycaemic index).

Samples of non-neoplastic liver tissue were collected and processed routinely.

These showed no histological signs of steatosis, inflammation or fibrosis.

Ethics approvals were obtained from the scientific and ethical committees of the involved hospitals (Hospital Clínico de Valencia, Spain and Royal Free Hospital, UK) and all the participants provided written informed consent in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.

PARAGRAPH

Liver histology.

Histological disease activity was evaluated on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver sections stained with H&E, and Masson’s trichrome.

Stained sections were graded by an experienced hepatopathologist according to the NAFLD scoring system proposed by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease NASH Clinical Research Network.19

In accordance with the report of the NASH Clinical Research Network, a NAFLD activity score ≥5 corresponded in most cases to a diagnosis of NASH, a score of 2 corresponded to ‘‘non-NASH’’ or simple steatosis, while scores of 3 or 4 could reflect either NASH or non-NASH.

PARAGRAPH

Blood analyses.

Blood samples for ammonia, ALT, AST, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), INR, albumin, glucose, insulin, glycated haemoglobin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides and CRP were analysed immediately following collection by routine analytical methods.

The homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-index was calculated in accordance with the model.20

PARAGRAPH

Liver tissue analyses: OTC, GS and CK-19 immunohistochemistry.

Tissue samples were placed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin within 1 h of surgical removal, fixed for 20 h and paraffin-embedded using standard procedures.

Liver sections (4 µm) were deparaffinised in xylene and hydrated through graded alcohols.

OTC, GS and CK-19 immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed as described in the Supplementary information.

PARAGRAPH

OTC enzyme activity.

OTC enzyme activity was assessed as previously described in relation to the animal experiments.

PARAGRAPH

Ammonia staining.

Paraffin-embedded sections of 5 µm were deparaffinised in xylene and hydrated through graded alcohols.

Sections were washed in distilled water and incubated for 5 min with Nessler’s reagent, previously filtered with a 0.45 µm membrane.

The sections were then washed briefly twice in distilled water, counterstained with Mayer’s haematoxylin, washed with running tap water, dehydrated in graded alcohols and mounted with DPX permanent mounting medium.21

PARAGRAPH

OTC and ammonia imaging quantification.

OTC IHC and ammonia staining were quantified using the Open Source Plugin for the Quantitative Evaluation optimised by Varghese et al.22 For further information please refer to the Supplementary information.

PARAGRAPH

Methylation assay.

Human methylation analyses were carried out by EpigenDx (Hopkinton, MA, USA).

Briefly, human genomic DNA was bisulfite converted to modify unmethylated cytosines to uracils.

Subsequently, library construction, amplification and enrichment of +/− 1 region of CPS1 and -2.4 kb of OTC from the transcriptional start sites were performed.

The resulting PCR amplicons went through a tagmentation process.

Subsequently, the libraries were sequenced and reads mapped to the reference sequence, and the relative proportion of methylated and unmethylated alleles at each CpG site was determined.

Thirty-seven CpG islands for CPS1 and 22 for OTC were found, sequenced and analysed (Table S2).

SECTION

In vitro studies

PARAGRAPH

All experiments were approved by the Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Barcelona and were conducted in accordance with the European Community guidelines for the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes (European Economic Community Directive 86/609).

PARAGRAPH

Primary hepatocytes were isolated from male Wistar rats (n = 4, 300–350 g) (Charles River, Sant Cugat del Vallès, Spain) and cultured as described in the Supplementary information.

Bovine serum albumin and free fatty acid (FFA) solutions (palmitate acid and oleate acid) were prepared as described in detail in the Supplementary information.

Hepatocytes were seeded in collagen six well plates for 4 h after the isolation with a medium containing 10% foetal bovine serum.

Dead hepatocytes were removed by extensive washing and left overnight with a medium containing 2% foetal bovine serum.

The next day, cells were incubated with FFAs.

After 48 and 72 h, respectively, lipid accumulation in the hepatocytes was quantified using Oil-red-O staining as described in the Supplementary information.

PARAGRAPH

Methylation analyses of two regions in the Otc promoter and real-time qPCR for Cps1 and Otc were performed as described in the section under animal experiments except that 0.4 μg of RNA was used for cell analyses.

PARAGRAPH

Ammonia levels were measured in the supernatant using standard methods at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona’s CORE laboratory.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Statistical analysis was performed using Stata 11.1 software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).

In the animal study, continuous variables were analysed using Kruskal-Wallis rank test and histology scores using Fisher’s exact test.

When significant, post hoc tests for continuous variables were performed among groups by the Mann-Whitney test and histology scores using Fisher’s exact test.

In the human study, the assumption of normality was checked using quantile-quantile plots (Q-Q plots) and histograms to ensure normally distributed variables.

Differences between normally distributed patient characteristics were evaluated by Student’s t test.

Pearson’s χ2 test was used to compare categorical variables.

Some variables showed skewed distributions with variance heterogeneity, but after log10 transformation most variables were considered normally distributed with variance homogeneity, and Student’s t test was performed on the transformed data.

However, NAFLD score, fibrosis score, bilirubin, INR and glucose were evaluated by the Mann-Whitney test.

When comparing the differences between patients with steatosis and NASH, and controls, the data were analysed using ANOVA; when significant, post hoc tests were performed among groups by Student’s t test.

In the in vitro study, differences between the groups were analysed using Kruskal-Wallis rank test.

When significant, post hoc tests were performed among groups by the Mann-Whitney test.

Normally distributed data are presented as mean ± SD and log-transformed and non-parametric tested data are presented as median (IQR).

p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

SECTION

Animal study

SECTION

Animal characteristics

PARAGRAPH

After 10 and 12 months, the liver weight increased threefold in the HFHC animals compared with controls (NC) (p <0.01) and was reduced 30% after changing the diet back to normal chow (p <0.05).

In addition, the spleen weight increased after 10 and 12 months in HFHC-fed animals (p <0.05 and p <0.01, respectively) and decreased after changing back to normal chow, although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.20) (Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

Plasma ALT was increased in HFHC animals compared with controls (10 months: p <0.01, 12 months: p <0.05) and normalised when changed back to normal chow (p <0.01).

Similarly, albumin decreased in HFHC animals (10 months: p <0.05, 12 months: p <0.01) and increased, not significantly, on normal chow (p = 0.14).

Total cholesterol was markedly increased in HFHC animals (p <0.01, 10 and 12 months) and decreased when changed back to normal chow (p <0.01) (Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

Macroscopically, the livers from HFHC-fed rats were enlarged and pale yellow.

Microscopically, HFHC-group livers showed severe steatosis, with varying degrees of hepatocyte ballooning, inflammation and fibrosis.

Overall, most of the HFHC animals showed histological evidence of NASH.

Similar histological changes continued to be present in the livers of animals that had reverted to normal chow, but there was a non-statistically significant improvement in hepatocyte ballooning (Table 1).

Histologically, livers from control animals were entirely normal.

Liver triglycerides were significantly increased in HFHC animals compared with controls and tended to decrease after changing back to normal chow, but these changes were not statistically significant (Table 1).

SECTION

UCE gene expression

PARAGRAPH

In the HFHC animals, gene expression of Otc was reduced significantly compared with control animals (p <0.01, both).

Changing the HFHC diet to normal chow restored Otc gene expression (p = 0.03).

In addition, Cps1 gene expression decreased in HFHC animals compared with controls (p <0.05, both).

No differences were observed between groups for Ass, Asl or Arg gene expression (Fig. 1).

SECTION

OTC and CPS protein expression

PARAGRAPH

Among the 5 UCEs, only Otc and Cps1 showed marked reduction at the mRNA level in the HFHC animals compared with controls.

This was further confirmed at the protein expression level for OTC and CPS1, demonstrating that both proteins were affected in HFHC animals and not in controls.

In addition, by changing the HFHC diet to normal chow OTC and CPS1 protein levels were restored (Fig. 2A, B).

SECTION

OTC enzyme activity

PARAGRAPH

OTC enzyme activity was significantly reduced in the HFHC animals compared with controls, both after 10 months (0.18 ± 0.03 vs. 0.34 ± 0.06 nmol/min/μg protein; p <0.01) and 12 months (0.18 ± 0.02 vs. 0.33 ± 0.05 nmol/min/μg protein; p <0.01).

OTC enzyme activity was restored when changing the diet to normal chow (0.26 ± 0.04 vs. 0.18 ± 0.02 nmol/min/μg protein; p <0.01; Fig. 2C).

SECTION

Methylation

PARAGRAPH

Initially, we quantified the global DNA methylation in all our groups.

No statistically significant differences were observed (Fig. S1).

On further investigation of the region upstream of the Otc start codon, we observed an increase in %5-mC for region 1 (between -436F and -175R bp) and region 2 (between -216F and -67R bp) in the HFHC animals compared with controls, both after 10 months (region 1: 6.7 ± 1.8 vs. 2.7 ± 1.2%5-mC, p = 0.02; region 2: 2.6 ± 0.7 vs. 0.7 ± 0.4%5-mC, p = 0.02) and 12 months (region 1: 7.4 ± 0.9 vs. 3.1 ± 1.3%5-mC, p = 0.02; region 2: 2.3 ± 1.0 vs. 0.5 ± 0.4%5-mC, p = 0.02).

Reversal of NASH by changing the diet to normal chow reduced %5-mC in region 1 (5.6 ± 0.7 vs. 7.4 ± 0.9%5-mC, p = 0.04; Fig. 3).

SECTION

Human studies

SECTION

Patients

PARAGRAPH

Demographic, clinical, histological and biochemical characteristics of patients are listed (Table S3).

Twenty patients with steatosis (age 44 ± 9 years; 16 women (80%); BMI 49 ± 8) and 15 patients with NASH (age 51 ± 6 years; 13 women (87%); BMI 49 ± 8) were included prospectively.

As expected, the NAFLD score was higher in patients with NASH than in patients with steatosis (6 (6–7) vs. 1 (1–1), p <0.001).

Also, the fibrosis score was higher in patients with NASH than those with steatosis (3 (1–3) vs. 0 (0–0), p <0.001).

SECTION

Glutamine synthetase staining

PARAGRAPH

GS protein levels were assessed by IHC.

GS positive cells were found around the pericentral area in healthy controls, whereas GS concentrations progressively decreased in patients with steatosis and NASH (Fig. 4A).

Its localisation was still in the pericentral area in patients with steatosis, but it had lost this pericentral zonation in patients with NASH.

SECTION

OTC staining and enzyme activity

PARAGRAPH

OTC protein levels were assessed by IHC.

Healthy controls showed a periportal distribution of cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for OTC.

A few stained hepatocytes with massive lipid droplet content and no zonal pattern were detected in patients with steatosis, and a complete lack of zonal distribution pattern was observed in samples from patients with NASH (Fig. 4B).

A progressive decrease in OTC staining was observed with a 50% reduction in patients with steatosis compared with controls (p = 0.003) and a further 50% reduction in patients with NASH compared to those with steatosis (p = 0.002; Fig. 4C).

PARAGRAPH

The OTC enzyme activity was markedly decreased in patients with steatosis (0.045 ± 0.039 μmol/min/μg) and NASH (0.059 ± 0.040 μmol/min/μg) compared with the controls (0.268 ± 0.061 μmol/min/μg), p <0.0001, both.

No difference in OTC enzyme activity was observed between patients with steatosis and NASH (Fig. 4D).

SECTION

Ammonia levels

PARAGRAPH

Patients with NASH had increased plasma ammonia levels (112 ± 35 μM) compared with patients with steatosis (87 ± 24; p = 0.01; Fig. 5D).

Nessler's staining in human liver samples showed a fivefold increase in ammonia concentrations in patients with steatosis compared with controls (p <0.0001) and a further twofold increase in patients with NASH compared to patients with steatosis (p <0.001; Fig. 5C).

Nessler's reagent showed accumulation of ammonia in patients with NASH and brown/black precipitates where inflammatory foci were present (Fig. 5B).

Comparison of the site of ammonia staining with that of GS and CK-19 staining (Fig. 5A) to localise the bile ducts suggested that ammonia was distributed ubiquitously in the liver lobule without any specific distribution.

SECTION

Methylation

PARAGRAPH

CpG islands at -1,564, -1,561, -969 and -960bp from the start codon of CPS1 were hypermethylated in NASH compared with controls and patients with steatosis (9 vs. 5; 11 vs. 4; 7 vs. 4; 6 vs. 3% of methylation, respectively, Fig. 6A).

For OTC, CpG islands at -647, -360, -354 and -295bp upstream of the start codon showed high levels of methylation in patients with NASH compared with controls and those with steatosis (28 vs. 12; 25 vs. 14; 71 vs. 61; 64 vs. 48% of methylation, respectively, Fig. 6B).

Interestingly, the overall % of methylation for the entire region under analysis was higher for OTC than CPS1.

Furthermore, the hypermethylated region of the OTC gene in patients with NASH overlapped with the hypermethylated region in HFHC-fed rats (from -647 to -295bp and from 436 to -67bp, respectively) located on chromosome X in both species.

SECTION

In vitro study in primary rat hepatocytes

PARAGRAPH

After incubation with a FFA mixture, lipid droplets were visible intracellularly and tended to accumulate around the nuclei (Fig. 7A).

Oil-red-O staining reached the highest reading after 48 h of incubation with a 200 μM FFA concentration (48 h 200 μM vs. 48 h non-treated; p = 0.02; Fig. 7B).

PARAGRAPH

The previously described region 1 and 2 upstream of the Otc start codon were both found to be hypermethylated 48 and 72 h after incubation with all three concentrations of FFA mixture (48 + 72 h 100/200/400 μM vs. 48 + 72 h non-treated, respectively; p = 0.02–0.04; Fig. 7C+D).

Otc and Cps1 levels were reduced at the mRNA level 48 and 72 h after treatment with the 400 μM FFA mixture compared with non-treated cells (48 + 72 h 400 μM vs. 48 + 72 h non-treated, respectively; p = 0.02–0.04; Fig. 7E+F).

PARAGRAPH

In the supernatant, the ammonia concentration increased significantly after both 48 and 72 h and at all three concentrations of FFA mixture (48 + 72 h 100/200/400 μM vs. 48 + 72 h non-treated, respectively; p = 0.02 all; Fig. 7G).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

We show for the first time that, even in the absence of cirrhosis, both experimental and clinical NASH are associated with a reduction in the gene and protein expression of the UCEs OTC and CPS1.

These functional changes are associated with hyperammonemia.

In the animal model, both the changes in gene and protein expression, and the abnormal OTC activity, were restored with dietary intervention, which was accompanied by biochemical improvement and a decrease in liver fat.

We were able to recapitulate the results of the in vivo experiment in an in vitro model of steatosis that was induced in primary rat hepatocytes.

The data showed that induction of progressive hepatocyte steatosis was associated with a significant dose dependent reduction in the gene expression of Otc and Cps1, with evidence of hypermethylation of these genes as observed in vivo.

This reduction in gene expression and hypermethylation was associated with a significantly greater and dose dependent increase in ammonia concentration in the supernatant of the steatotic hepatocytes, suggesting that steatosis is likely to be causal rather than a mere association.

PARAGRAPH

Histologically, dietary intervention resulted in a decrease in ballooning, but not in either steatosis or inflammation, suggesting that restoration of UCE expression and activity precedes improvement in histological appearance.

The lack of full histological recovery may be explained by a temporary increase in the production of endogenous fatty acids in the liver to make up for the fat missing in the diet23 and the increase in inflammation is likely an earlier described consequence of the sudden change in calorie intake.23,24

This suggests that components of the diet (e.g. FFAs, cholesterol) may have a direct effect on the regulation of the mitochondrial UCEs.

Fatty acids undergo β-oxidation in the mitochondria to produce cellular energy.

Thus, the increased fatty acid load on the liver might disrupt mitochondrial function, thereby affecting OTC and CPS1 function.

In patients with NAFLD, epigenetic modifications of liver mitochondrial DNA have been shown to decrease transcriptional activity and protein expression of NADH dehydrogenase 6, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction.25

Dysfunctional mitochondria can send signals to the nucleus to alter gene expression in order to modify cellular function and reprogram cell metabolism.

This retrograde communication helps cells adapt to various stressors such as massive cytosolic lipid accumulation.26,27

PARAGRAPH

Our in vitro studies provide further support for our suggestion that hypermethylation of the promoter regions of UCE genes may be the operative mechanism of the observed changes in UCEs induced by steatosis.

We demonstrate that accumulation of lipids in rat hepatocytes from medium-chain fatty acids induces hypermethylation of the Otc promoter gene and eventually a decrease in the gene expression of UCEs and an increase in ammonia concentrations in the culture medium.

In keeping with this observation, long-chain fatty acids have previously been found to suppress UCE gene expression in vitro.28

Previous studies focussing on the methylome in patients with NAFLD and early or severe disease have shown that over 60,000 CpG sites are differentially methylated, contributing to differences in gene expression.29,30

The mechanism in which induction of steatosis results in increased methylation of the UCE genes has not been clarified in this study.

PARAGRAPH

Our studies extend these observations by demonstrating that in patients with steatosis and NASH, hypermethylation of the promoter region of the CPS1 and OTC genes may be the operative mechanism of the observed changes in gene expression and function.

It has been suggested that epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation mediate the effects of environmental factors, including a western-style diet, on the development and progression of NAFLD.31

Epigenetic alterations are known to be involved in lipid metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress and inflammation.31

In a mouse model, a high-fat high-sucrose diet induced steatosis and was associated with methylation of total DNA and specific gene promoters in the liver.32

Moreover, in humans with NAFLD, altered methylation of genes involved in the development of steatohepatitis and fibrosis was observed, and its severity varied between mild and advanced NAFLD, suggesting a role for DNA methylation in the progression of NAFLD.25,30,33

These changes were reversible after bariatric surgery and weight loss, by remodelling of the epigenetic signature.29

Given these observations, it is possible that altered DNA methylation may also be the regulatory mechanism of urea synthesis, through differential gene expression of OTC and CPS1.

DNA methylation is more likely associated with transcriptional repression when present at the promoter regions of the genes and it follows that higher levels of DNA methylation around gene promoters correlate with low or no transcription, thereby regulating the activity of the genes.34

Therefore, we studied sites upstream of the start codon of the relevant promoter genes and found several regions that were hypermethylated, suggesting that altered DNA methylation could be the regulatory mechanism behind decreased urea synthesis in NASH.

In keeping with this observation, a proteomic study showed downregulation of CPS1 in patients with NASH.35

PARAGRAPH

The reduction in UCE expression and activity was associated with increased ammonia levels, which has also been observed by Felipo et al.17 It is noteworthy that the patients with NASH had higher ammonia levels compared with patients with simple steatosis, whereas no differences in OTC protein expression and enzyme activity were observed.

This observation is consistent with the fact that DNA methylation of CPS1 was more marked in patients with NASH compared to those with steatosis.

CPS1 is the flux-generating urea cycle feeder enzyme which under physiological conditions, controls influx to the cycle.

As CPS1 is also localised in the mitochondria and has previously been found to be downregulated in patients with NASH,35 it is likely that patients with NASH had a more pronounced reduction in CPS1 activity, causing a further functional downregulation of ureagenesis and, ultimately, hyperammonemia.

Also, hepatic GS protein expression was more reduced in patients with NASH, which most likely contributes to the high ammonia levels.

This hypothesis will need to be studied.

The data we present demonstrating that hyperammonemia is a feature of early stages of NAFLD has potential implications for the treatment of the disease.

We have shown in previous studies that chronic exposure to high levels of ammonia has a profound effect on HSC activation status and that its removal impacts positively on the HSC’s phenotype in vitro and in vivo.

We suggest that removal of ammonia in patients with NASH would lead to a more quiescent HSC phenotype and slow the progression of NAFLD.

In preliminary studies, the administration of OCR-002, a drug known to reduce ammonia concentration, prevented progression of fibrosis.36

Furthermore, patients with NAFLD have been shown to have hyperammonemia and neuropsychological disturbances,17 although the mechanism underlying this has not yet been clarified.

In conclusion, steatosis in rats and humans is associated with reversible changes in UCEs that result in hyperammonemia, possibly through hypermethylation of UCE genes and impairment of urea synthesis.

These data could be reproduced in an in vitro model of hepatocyte steatosis, suggesting that the changes in UCE induced by steatosis were likely to be causal rather than a mere association.

As hyperammonemia can cause progression of liver injury and fibrosis, these findings support a strategy of targeting ammonia as a potential treatment for NASH.
