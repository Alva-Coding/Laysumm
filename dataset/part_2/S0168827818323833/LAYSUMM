TITLE

Reduced phenotypic expression in genetic hemochromatosis with time: Role of exposure to non-genetic modifiers

PARAGRAPH

Genetic hemochromatosis is an inherited disorder that leads to progressive iron overload in the body.

It results in chronic fatigue and in potential liver (cirrhosis), pancreas (diabetes) and joint (arthritis) damage in adulthood.

The present study showed that tobacco smoking may aggravate iron loading, but that hemochromatosis has become less and less severe over the last 30â€¯years despite patients being older at diagnosis, likely because of the protective effects of lower alcohol consumption and of increased weight in the French population.
