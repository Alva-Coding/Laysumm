TITLE

Non-invasive prediction of liver-related events in patients with HCV-associated compensated advanced chronic liver disease after oral antivirals

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have become the new standard of care for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, demonstrating high efficacy, with most patients achieving a sustained virological response (SVR) regardless of HCV genotype.

Due to their good safety profile, any patient in any stage of chronic liver disease (from mild fibrosis to decompensated cirrhosis) can be treated with DAAs.1

Therefore, it is important to know which patients will be prone to developing liver-related complications, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or liver decompensation, requiring lifelong follow-up and which patients can be safely discharged from follow-up.

PARAGRAPH

Several studies have demonstrated that in patients with cirrhosis who have achieved SVR after DAA therapy there is a decrease in liver-related events due to an improvement in liver function and portal hypertension, and a decrease in the incidence of de novo HCC, accompanied by an overall increase in survival rates.2–7

These studies have also demonstrated that patients with cirrhosis are at higher risk of complications than those without cirrhosis.

However, the variability in the methods used to select and define patients with cirrhosis in different published studies and the heterogeneity of patients included, mixing patients with compensated cirrhosis and decompensated cirrhosis, makes it hard to find predictors to identify high-risk populations and validate the results.

PARAGRAPH

It is also important to note that currently most of the asymptomatic patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis are diagnosed by elastographic methods such transient elastography and not by liver biopsy.

So in many of these cases, the exact stage of the disease is suspected, but unconfirmed.

For this reason, the Baveno VI consensus defined patients with liver stiffness measurement (LSM) ≥10 kPa and no prior decompensation as having “compensated advanced chronic liver disease” (cACLD).8

This patient population is of particular interest because, although they have never decompensated, approximately 80–90% of them have portal hypertension and up to 50–60% have clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH).9

It would probably be easier to identify low-risk groups for liver-related events in this cACLD population, where some patients have an initial degree of advanced liver disease and higher odds of improving with therapy, than to identify them in mixed cirrhotic populations (Child-Pugh class A-B) affected by more advanced disease (with a higher proportion of CSPH and a greater risk of complications), in whom mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis might already have been initiated.

PARAGRAPH

The aim of the present study was to describe the incidence of liver-related events in a population of patients with HCV-associated cACLD who achieved SVR after DAA therapy, and to identify non-invasive parameters (serological and elastographic) to predict the occurrence of liver-related events.

SECTION

Patients and methods

PARAGRAPH

This is a prospective cohort study from 2 tertiary hospitals (Hospital Universitari Vall d’Hebron and Hospital Clinic) from Barcelona, Spain.

All adult patients (≥18 years old) who started DAA therapy for HCV infection between January 1st, 2015 and March 31st, 2016 were assessed for participation in the study.

The inclusion criteria were: i) suspected cACLD defined by LSM ≥10 kPa and no prior decompensation (ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy or jaundice) according to Baveno VI definition;8 ii) confirmed SVR 12 weeks after finishing therapy; and iii) Child-Pugh class A. Patients were excluded when i) LSM was not available before starting therapy; ii) they had history of prior HCC or developed HCC before confirming SVR; iii) they had prior liver transplant or iv) they had concomitant coinfection with HBV and/or HIV.

All consecutive patients who agreed to participate in the study were included.

The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

The ethical review boards of each participating center approved the protocol.

All patients gave written informed consent before inclusion.

SECTION

Study procedures

PARAGRAPH

Data on demographics (age, gender, body mass index), HCV genotype, type of DAA therapy and laboratory parameters before starting therapy, such as platelet count, renal function, aminotransferases, international normalized ratio, albumin, bilirubin, Child-Pugh and model for end-stage liver disease scores were collected to define baseline characteristics.

Data on abdominal ultrasound performed within 6 months before starting therapy was also collected.

SVR was defined as undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks after finishing treatment using the Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Pleasanton, CA; lower limit of detection, 15 IU/ml).

Once SVR was confirmed, patients underwent abdominal ultrasound and laboratory work-up every 6 months, as per standard clinical practice, and LSM at 12 months after finishing treatment.

SECTION

Liver stiffness measurement

PARAGRAPH

LSM was performed using transient elastography (Fibroscan 502 Touch, Echosens, Paris, France) at baseline (within 6 months before starting treatment) and at 1 year after finishing treatment, in a fasting state, performed by a single experienced operator in each center and according to the usual standard procedure.

Quality criteria used in both centers were: at least 10 valid measurements and an interquartile to median ratio ≤30%.

Only valid assessments were considered for the analysis.

During follow-up, improvement in LSM was defined as a decrease of ≥20% from basal LSM.

This criterion was used because values above and below 15% were considered as a normal variability of the procedure (defined per the interquartile to median ratio of 30%).

SECTION

Liver-related events and follow-up

PARAGRAPH

During follow-up any liver-related event was registered.

Liver-related events were defined as occurrence of ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy or HCC.

Follow-up started when DAA therapy was finished, however only liver-related events occurring after SVR was confirmed were considered.

Mortality was also registered as liver-related or non-liver-related.

Patients were followed until the first occurrence of liver-related events, death or until the end of December 2018, whichever event occurred first.

In patients who were lost during follow-up, the last day they were known to be alive was registered.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

For the descriptive analysis, quantitative variables were expressed as mean (SD) and qualitative variables as absolute frequency and percentage.

Comparisons between groups for continuous variables were performed using Student's t test and for categorical variables using Chi-square test or Fisher's test, when appropriate.

Paired data (LSM at baseline and at follow-up) were analyzed using pair t test.

PARAGRAPH

Due to different mechanisms of occurrence and different factors that could influence its occurrence, liver-related events were described separately according to those related to portal hypertension (ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy) and HCC events.

The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of liver-related events in the cohort.

Comparison of the survival curves between groups was performed using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.

Data was censored when any of the following: liver-related events, death, lost or end of follow-up (until 31st December, 2018), occurred first.

Univariate and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of liver-related events.

Variables found to be statistically significant in univariate analyses (defined as p <0.1) were included in the multivariate analysis by forward stepwise approach.

Significant variables (p <0.05) were kept in the final Cox model to assess the hazard of liver-related events.

The results are expressed as adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and their 95% CIs.

Significance was considered as 2-sided p values <0.05.

A nomogram was constructed to predict the risk of HCC during follow-up.10

Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 13.1 statistical software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, US).

Results

SECTION

Study population

PARAGRAPH

A total of 1,563 patients in both centers who started DAA therapy between January 1st, 2015 and March 31st, 2016 were evaluated for eligibility.

SVR was confirmed in 1,518 patients (97.1%) and finally, a total of 572 patients with cACLD were included in the study (Fig. 1).

The baseline characteristics of the patients included are described in Table 1.

The mean age of the patients included was 63.7 years and 49.3% were male.

Most patients had HCV genotype 1 (85.8%) and 78.1% patients were treated with DAAs for 12 weeks.

Some differences were detected in both cohorts.

Patients from Hospital Clínic had lower platelet counts, higher bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase and albumin levels and higher LSM at baseline than in the Vall d’Hebron cohort.

SECTION

Evolution of LSM after DAA therapy

PARAGRAPH

At baseline, mean LSM was 20.2 kPa (SD 10.4 kPa).

LSM was repeated in 554 patients after 1 year of follow-up, improving to a mean of 13.9 kPa (SD 9.2 kPa) (p <0.001), with a mean decrease from baseline of 28.9%.

LSM improved (defined as decrease from baseline ≥20%) in 391 patients (70.6%).

Fig. 2 depicts distribution of LSM at baseline and at follow-up according to LSM value in patients with both measurements; remarkably, almost 40% of the patients achieved LSM <10 kPa at follow-up.

SECTION

Follow-up and liver-related events

PARAGRAPH

The median follow-up was 2.9 years (range 0.3–3.8 years) during which 17 patients (3%) were lost to follow-up, 5 patients (0.9%) died from non-liver-related causes and 32 patients (5.6%) presented liver-related events.

No patients died from liver-related causes.

PARAGRAPH

The most frequent liver-related event was HCC, which occurred in 25 patients (4.4%), at an incidence rate of 1.5/100 patient-years.

The median time to HCC occurrence was 1 year (range 0.4–3.3 years).

There were 5 patients (0.9%) who presented with portal hypertension-related decompensation (2 patients suffered from variceal bleeding and 3 patients had ascites).

The incidence rate for these decompensations was 0.31/100 patient-years.

Two additional patients developed a cholangiocarcinoma (0.3%) during follow-up (incidence rate 0.1/100 patient-years).

SECTION

Factors related to portal hypertension-related decompensation

PARAGRAPH

Due to the low incidence of events (5 patients; 0.9%), it was not possible to find predictors of occurrence of portal hypertension-related events.

All 5 of these patients had baseline LSM >20 kPa.

During follow-up, LSM only improved (decrease ≥20%) in 1 of the 5 patients.

Four patients had baseline platelet count below 100x109/L, whereas the patient whose LSM improved had a baseline platelet count of 160 × 109/L.

Characteristics of these patients are described in Table S1.

PARAGRAPH

Based on LSM, patients who had baseline LSM ≥20 kPa and a lack of LSM improvement during follow-up were at an increased risk of developing liver decompensation (HR 39.7; 95% CI 4.4–355.4) (Fig. S1).

The estimated incidence in this high-risk group was 2.7/100 patient-years vs. 0.07/100 patient-years in the low-risk group (p <0.001).

SECTION

Predictors of HCC occurrence

PARAGRAPH

As shown in Table 2, by univariate analysis, patients who developed HCC during follow-up were older, had lower baseline and follow-up albumin levels and less frequently had LSM <10 kPa at the first year of follow-up.

Liver stiffness at follow-up was higher in patients who presented with HCC, but these differences were not statistically significant.

By multivariate analysis, at baseline, only albumin levels (HR 0.29; 95% CI 0.11–0.76; p = 0.012) were independently associated with the risk of presenting with HCC during follow-up.

At follow-up, albumin levels (HR 0.08; 95% CI 0.02–0.25; p <0.001) and LSM <10 kPa at follow-up (HR 0.33; 95% CI 0.11–0.96; p = 0.042) were the only predictors associated with the risk of presenting with HCC during follow-up.

PARAGRAPH

In order to construct a simple model to predict the risk of HCC, survival curves among different subgroups based on multivariate analysis were evaluated.

We categorized baseline LSM based on established cut-offs (<15 kPa, 15–20 kPa, ≥20 kPa) to compare risk groups.8

Thus, LSM >15 kPa was highly suggestive of cACLD and LSM ≥20 kPa indicated a very high probability of CSPH.

As detected in multivariate analysis, no differences were observed in HCC occurrence according to baseline LSM (Fig. S2A) (p = 0.287).

Moreover, there were no differences in HCC occurrence in patients according to LSM improvement, neither when improvement was defined as a decrease in ≥20% (p = 0.117) nor when defined as recently published (decrease in ≥30%) (p = 0.274) (Fig. S2B, C).11

PARAGRAPH

As previously shown in Table 2, HCC risk was different in patients according to baseline albumin.

When selecting the cut-off of 4 g/dl based on the mean value, patients with albumin <4 g/dl at baseline had an increased risk of HCC occurrence compared to those with baseline albumin ≥4 g/dl (HR 3.27; 95% CI 1.45–7.36; p = 0.004) (Fig. 3A).

Meanwhile, the risk of developing HCC differed according to LSM during follow-up, observing a linear trend, that is, the higher the LSM at follow-up the higher the risk of HCC (Fig. 3B).

Patients with an LSM of between 10–20 kPa at follow-up had an increased, but not significant, risk of HCC compared to those with LSM <10 kPa at follow-up (HR 2.48; 95% CI 0.79–7.80; p = 0.120), while the HR for HCC was 4.53 (95% CI 1.36–15.08, p = 0.014) for patients with LSM ≥20 kPa at follow-up compared to those with LSM <10 kPa (Fig. 3B).

HCC risk was also different according to albumin levels during follow-up.

Patients with albumin <4.4 g/dl (based on the mean value) were at a high-risk of developing HCC (HR 2.36; 95% CI 1.02–5.47; p = 0.046) (Fig. 3C).

PARAGRAPH

We combined both follow-up albumin and LSM to identify risk groups according to predictors gathered at the same time point (1 year after finishing treatment).

Table 3 shows the incidence rate of HCC according to different combinations of albumin and LSM at follow-up.

Incidence rates of HCC were <1/100 patient-years in patients with LSM <10 kPa at follow-up and in those with LSM between 10–20 kPa and high albumin levels (≥4.4 g/dl at baseline).

On the contrary, patients with LSM ≥20 kPa at follow-up and those with LSM 10–20 kPa and low albumin levels (<4.4 g/dl) have incidence rates of HCC ≥1.9/100 patient-years, indicating that albumin levels only impacted on HCC risk in patients with LSM between 10–20 kPa.

Therefore, we identified 2 main risk groups, a low-risk group and a high-risk group for HCC, with different estimates of HCC incidence (Fig. 4).

A Cox regression model was constructed using these variables (albumin <4.4/≥4.4 and LSM at follow-up <10 kPa/10–20 kPa/≥20 kPa) with a good predictive power (Harrell’s C index = 0.73) (Fig. S3).

In Figs. 5, 2 nomograms to predict the probability of HCC occurrence according to albumin levels and LSM at follow-up are shown.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The main findings of the present study, in a cohort of patients with HCV-associated cACLD who achieved SVR after DAA therapy, were that the incidence of liver-related events was relatively low, with de novo HCC being the most frequent complication, and that using simple non-invasive predictors (albumin and LSM at follow-up) we could identify 2 patient groups with a differing risk of HCC during follow-up.

PARAGRAPH

Several studies have demonstrated that in patients who achieve SVR after DAA therapy, the incidence of HCC decreases and that the main predictor of its occurrence, as expected, is the presence of cirrhosis, with patients affected with a more advanced liver disease (such as decompensated cirrhosis) and those with a history of HCC at the highest risk.12–21

PARAGRAPH

HCC was the main complication observed in our study.

There were 25 patients (4.4%) who developed HCC, that is 78% of all liver-related events observed in the cohort.

The incidence rate of HCC was 1.5/100 patients-year.

This incidence was similar to previous reported series which included patients with cirrhosis.16–18,22,23

In contrast to what has been previously reported, when we stratified the risk of HCC according to LSM at baseline, we did not find differences in HCC incidence among patients with LSM ≥20 kPa and those with LSM <20 kPa.

Two studies reported that patients with high baseline LSM had an increased risk of HCC.15,24

In the study of Conti, et al., LSM ≥21.3 kPa was associated with a higher risk of presenting HCC (OR 4.24; 95% CI 1.50–11.97).15

In the same line, Degasperi, et al. found that baseline LSM was a predictor of de novo HCC, with the best cut-off being an LSM ≥30 kPa.24

In our cohort, 212 patients had baseline LSM ≥20 kPa, of whom 13 (6.1%) presented with HCC, while HCC occurred in 12 patients with baseline LSM <20 kPa (3.3%); these differences were not statistically significant.

One explanation for these differences between our study and previously published studies is that in both previous studies Child-Pugh B patients were included.

Although the distribution of LSM was not described according to Child-Pugh class, those patients with worse liver function also had higher LSM, which could lead to an overestimation of the effect of baseline LSM.

In our cohort, including only patients with Child-Pugh class A and no prior history of HCC, baseline LSM did not predict the occurrence of HCC.

PARAGRAPH

A retrospective study from Ravaioli, et al. including 139 patients with cirrhosis (11.5% Child-Pugh B and 13.7% with previous HCC) reported that a decrease of 30% in LSM was one of the predictors that was inversely associated with the risk of presenting with HCC.11

In our cohort, LSM improvement (defined as LSM decrease ≥20%) was not associated with the risk of HCC.

LSM improved in 13 patients (52%) who developed HCC and in most of the patients who did not develop HCC (71.2%).

This probably reflects that most of the early dynamic changes in LSM are related to improvement in liver inflammation and they do not accurately reflect improvement in fibrosis.

It is important to note that these high rates of LSM improvement do not translate into a decreased risk of HCC and for this reason it is important to continue HCC surveillance.

PARAGRAPH

The main predictors related to HCC risk in our study were albumin and follow-up LSM.

Although most of the patients had normal albumin levels, the risk of HCC was reduced by 58% in patients with albumin ≥4.4 g/dl at follow-up.

Based on both predictors (albumin and LSM at follow-up), we could identify 2 main risk groups: i) patients with LSM at follow-up <10 kPa or patients with LSM between 10 and 20 kPa with albumin ≥4.4 g/dl at follow-up had a lower incidence of HCC (0.6/100 patients-year) compared to ii) patients with LSM ≥20 kPa at follow-up or those with LSM between 10–20 kPa but albumin <4.4 g/dl at follow-up (2.9/100 patients-year).

It has to be highlighted that 220 patients achieved LSM <10 kPa during follow-up and of them, 4 patients (1.8%) developed HCC.

Although the risk is much lower than in patients with the highest LSM at follow-up, the recommendation, as in recently published guidelines, is to continue HCC surveillance after SVR in patients with pre-treatment LSM ≥10 kPa until information about longer follow-up is available.25

However, a recent study reported that surveillance for patients with advanced fibrosis (i.e. F3) who achieved SVR is not cost-effective due to the low incidence of HCC, questioning the need for continued surveillance in some specific subgroups of patients.26

PARAGRAPH

Metabolic syndrome has been associated as a risk factor of HCC occurrence in patients who have achieved SVR, as was observed in the French CirVir cohort.21

One explanation could be the lack of improvement of fibrosis in these patients and an increase of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis prevalence in patients with these features.

However, we could not observe an association between some factors of metabolic syndrome such as body mass index, diabetes or dyslipidemia and the occurrence of HCC in our cohort.

The main differences between our cohort and the Nahon et al. cohort are the number of patients included (>1,000 in the Nahon et al. study) and the time of follow-up (median 58.2 months in the Nahon et al. study).

Probably, a larger follow-up will help to better define the association between metabolic syndrome and HCC in patients with cACLD.

PARAGRAPH

The incidence of portal hypertension-related complications was very low in this cohort, since only 5 patients (0.9%) presented with liver decompensation (3 ascites and 2 variceal bleeding).

This is the first prospective study in patients with cACLD that reports portal hypertension complications after achieving SVR.

In previous studies it has been demonstrated that SVR after DAA therapy reduces the incidence of portal hypertension-related complications.19

However, contrary to the present study, most of the series that have evaluated the incidence of portal hypertension-related complications after DAA therapy have included patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis and some of the predictors that had been related to decompensation, such as previous decompensation, cannot be applied in this cohort with cACLD.20,27–29

Although we could not find predictors of decompensation due to the low incidence rates, all 5 decompensated patients had baseline LSM ≥20 kPa and in 4 out of 5 patients LSM did not improve after SVR, remaining >20 kPa.

These 4 patients also have a platelet count below 100x109/L.

This suggests that these patients had more advanced liver disease and SVR did not reduce the risk of decompensating.

Although values of LSM have not yet been validated in non-viremic patients, LSM >20 kPa after SVR seems to have high specificity in ruling in the presence of CSPH and our results support this evidence.30–32

There was 1 patient, however, who developed variceal bleeding during follow-up and LSM improved from 23.1 kPa to 16.3 kPa during follow-up.

Indeed, Lens et al. reported that in patients with LSM <13.6 kPa at 6 months of follow-up, CSPH was still present in 43% of patients.31

PARAGRAPH

Our study has some limitations.

LSM was performed after 1 year of finishing treatment and therefore we do not have information about dynamics before and beyond that.

The earliest a predictor can be determined, the more useful it is.

Considering that most of the LSM decrease after SVR occurs early (at the end of therapy)33 and that LSM values do not change much afterwards, it is plausible to assume that the same predictions about liver-related events presented here can be done using LSM values obtained right after finishing therapy.

Another limitation is that the current results can only be applied to patients in whom an LSM can be obtained and is reliable.

Also, the validation of the predictors using an external cohort would definitely strengthen the results.

Instead, we can confirm that the predictors for HCC of our study were valid and significant for the 2 separate cohorts.

Fig. S4 depicts the cumulative incidence of HCC in each hospital according to low-risk and high-risk group definitions.

Despite these limitations, the strength of our study relies on being the first prospective bicentric study reporting outcomes after SVR of a large cohort of patients with cACLD, Child-Pugh A, with a follow-up of up to 3.5 years, providing useful information about the prognosis and simple prediction of events in asymptomatic patients with advanced liver disease.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that in patients with cACLD who have achieved SVR with DAA, HCC occurrence is the most frequent liver-related complication.

Both albumin levels and LSM during follow-up can help to identify patients at the highest risk of presenting with HCC.

Although patients with LSM <10 kPa at follow-up have a low risk of presenting HCC, a zero-risk subpopulation cannot be found, thus, HCC surveillance needs to be considered for all patients classified as having cACLD before therapy.

However, with the information provided by our study, patients and clinicians will possess the right information about the expected risk of HCC on an individual basis and more importantly, it will serve to stress the importance of continuing HCC screening (especially in the high-risk groups) and maintaining adherence to these programs by patients.
