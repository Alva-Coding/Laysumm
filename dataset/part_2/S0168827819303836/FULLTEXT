TITLE

Obeticholic acid may increase the risk of gallstone formation in susceptible patients

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Bile acids (BAs) are amphipathic molecules that are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver.

Once synthesized, they are conjugated with glycine or taurine and then excreted with bile into the small bowel from where about 95% are reabsorbed in the terminal ileum via the enterohepatic circulation.

In addition to their detergent properties that aid lipid digestion, BAs serve as signaling molecules by activating various nuclear and membrane-bound receptors, in particular the nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which regulates BA, glucose and lipid metabolism.1,2

BA homeostasis is maintained through negative feedback activation of FXR both within the liver (via SHP-LRH-1/HNF-4α) and from the small intestine (via FGF19-FGFR4/ß-klotho) by decreasing the expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the key enzyme in BA synthesis.3,4

PARAGRAPH

The potent FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OCA, 6α-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid) has been developed for the treatment of various cholestatic and metabolic liver diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).5,6

Currently, OCA is provisionally approved as a second-line treatment option in PBC.

It is important to note that the downstream effects of FXR activation in humans are largely unknown.

Almost all studies exploring these mechanisms have been conducted in murine models; however, because of substantial differences in BA metabolism and BA profiles between mice and humans, it is difficult to translate findings from these models into humans.1,2

PARAGRAPH

Herein, we aimed to decipher the downstream actions of FXR activation on human gallbladder and liver by studying the effects of OCA in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.

We hypothesized that decreased synthesis and excretion of BAs from the liver would affect gallbladder lipid composition resulting in an increased risk of gallstone formation.

Of note, with respect to hepatobiliary events, the recent interim analysis of the ongoing REGENERATE trial in patients with NASH reported that more patients (3%) on OCA 25 mg experienced gallstones or cholecystitis than those who received placebo (<1%) or OCA 10 mg (1%).7

SECTION

Study population and protocol

PARAGRAPH

In a double-blinded placebo-controlled randomized trial (Obeticholic Acid in Gallstone Surgery [OCAGS], Clinical Trials NCT01625026), 20 patients awaiting laparoscopic gallstone surgery with symptomatic gallstone disease but without significant comorbidity or medication known to affect glucose or lipid metabolism were randomized to OCA (25 mg/day, which is the same dose as in the OCA NASH trial6) or matching placebo for 3 weeks until the day before surgery.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as the clinical research file of our patients with symptomatic gallstone disease, were the same as in our previous study where we compared the molecular effects of rifampicin and ursodeoxycholic acid.8

Thus, exclusion criteria included previous or ongoing liver, kidney, intestinal or metabolic diseases, and the use of medications known to affect liver function and metabolism, e.g. lipid- or glucose-lowering drugs and P450 enzyme inducers.

Importantly, patients were not prescribed any low-calorie regimen before surgery.

Informed consent was obtained from all patients.

PARAGRAPH

Blood samples for biochemistry were collected from patients in the fasting state on the days immediately before study start and surgery.

During surgery, approximately 1 cm long harmonic-knife biopsies from the liver and the whole bile-filled gallbladder (in this order) were collected.

Bile was aspirated with a syringe after puncturing the gallbladder; the gallbladder was thereafter cut into pieces for tissue samples.

Due to suspicion of gallbladder polyps, 1 gallbladder from each group was sent away for pathological evaluation and thus not available for molecular biology analyses.

Tissues and bile aliquots were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen.

All samples were kept frozen at −80 °C until analysis.

PARAGRAPH

The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee in Gothenburg (Dnr 199/11; 08JUN2011) and the Swedish Medical Products Agency (EudraCT 2011-0008-13-37; 07MAY2012).

All authors had access to the study data and have reviewed and approved the final manuscript.

Analysis of bile acids, C4 and FGF19

PARAGRAPH

BAs and C4 (7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one) were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) as previously described.9

FGF19 was measured by ELISA according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Quantikine ELISA kit, R&D Systems).

SECTION

Cholesterol saturation index and bile acid hydrophobicity index

PARAGRAPH

The cholesterol saturation index was calculated according to Carey’s critical tables.10

The hydrophobicity index was calculated according to Heuman.11

SECTION

RNA isolation and qPCR

PARAGRAPH

RNA from human liver and gallbladder tissue was isolated following the RNeasy protocol (Qiagen, RNeasy Mini kit) including DNAse I digest on column.

RNA concentrations were measured by Nanodrop and 1 µg of RNA was subjected to cDNA synthesis (Superscript III, Invitrogen).

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed on a Light Cycler (Roche) with Luna Universal qPCR Master Mix (NEB).

PARAGRAPH

All qPCR data were normalized to 36b4.

Because RNA was isolated from full thickness gallbladder tissue and the proportion of epithelial versus non-epithelial tissue varied among different samples, gallbladder values were normalized to CK19 using the following formula:

PARAGRAPH

FGF19norm = 2^−(ΔFGF19 − KCK19)

PARAGRAPH

The FGF19norm gallbladder values (with and without OCA) were compared to the 2^−(ΔFGF19) liver values (with and without OCA).

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

All data are reported as mean ± SD, unless otherwise indicated.

Serum BAs and BAs, cholesterol and phospholipids in gallbladder bile were normally distributed both in the OCA and placebo groups.

P values were calculated with Student’s t test unless otherwise indicated.

A p value <0.05 was considered significant.

Results

SECTION

Patient demographics and clinical outcome

PARAGRAPH

The groups were well matched with no significant differences in sex, age, body mass index, absence of insulin resistance as estimated by homeostatic assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and baseline laboratory findings (Table 1).

All patients finished the study per protocol.

A total of 7 adverse events were reported: 1 common cold and 1 case of pruritus in both the OCA and placebo groups, 1 case of heartburn in the OCA group, 1 headache and 1 sleep disturbance in the placebo group.

There were no serious adverse events.

In the OCA group, there were minor yet significant increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase and decreases in gamma-glutamyltransferase after treatment (Table 1), confirming observations in the NASH trial with OCA.6

SECTION

OCA decreases bile acid synthesis

PARAGRAPH

OCA treatment promoted dramatic decreases in concentrations of the serum BA synthesis marker 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) and endogenous BAs (Table 1).

OCA constituted 44.3% of the total serum BAs (Table 1) and was present almost entirely as either glycine (54.4%) or taurine (44.9%) conjugates.

OCA conjugates, which are substrates of the ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT [also known as SLC10A2]),12 are taken up in the ileum and also by the liver.

The decreased BA synthesis was therefore likely a result of negative feedback promoted by OCA and its conjugates both indirectly by activation of intestinal FXR and increased circulating FGF19 (Table 1) and directly by activation of FXR in the hepatocytes.3

SECTION

OCA increases the cholesterol saturation index in gallbladder bile

PARAGRAPH

The concentration of total lipids (BAs, cholesterol, and phospholipids) in the gallbladder was significantly lower in OCA-versus placebo-treated patients (OCA, 102.1 ± 55.3 mmol/L; placebo, 228.0 ± 95.5 mmol/L; p <0.01; Fig. 1).

OCA treatment increased hepatic gene expression of the bile salt export pump (BSEP [or ABCB11]) (Fig. 2), a mechanism that was found to protect against gallstone development during FXR activation in mice.13

However, this response did not compensate for the significantly reduced BA synthesis after OCA treatment in our human study (Table 1), as the difference in total gallbladder lipids was explained by a lower concentration of gallbladder BAs in OCA- versus placebo-treated patients (OCA, 77.9 ± 53.6 mmol/L; placebo, 196.4 ± 99.3 mmol/L; p <0.01; Fig. 1).

There were no significant differences in gallbladder cholesterol or phospholipid concentrations between the groups (Fig. 1) and, in agreement, hepatic gene expression levels of their transporters ABCG5/8 and MDR3 (ABCB4) did not differ between OCA- and placebo-treated patients (Fig. 2).

PARAGRAPH

The lower proportion of gallbladder BAs as molar percentage of total lipids in OCA- versus placebo-treated patients (OCA, 74.8%; placebo, 84.9%) led to a significantly increased cholesterol saturation index in the OCA group (OCA, 2.8 ± 1.1; placebo, 1.8 ± 0.8; p <0.05).

These findings are in contrast to results obtained in gallstone-susceptible mice where FXR activation led to increased gene expression of canalicular BA and phospholipid transporters ABCB11 and ABCB4 resulting in increased concentrations of gallbladder BAs and phospholipids, and consequently, decreased cholesterol saturation index.14

However, the genetically susceptible mice only developed gallstones when fed a cholic acid-enriched lithogenic diet,14 and this specific experimental model condition may, at least in part, explain the difference between the human and mice results.

SECTION

OCA increases the bile acid hydrophobicity index in gallbladder bile

PARAGRAPH

We next determined the hydrophobicity of gallbladder BA composition.

Taurine- and glycine-conjugated OCA accounted for 13.6 ± 5.0% of gallbladder BAs in OCA-treated patients (Fig. 3A).

In our reversed phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography system, OCA and its conjugates eluted close to the most hydrophobic BA lithocholic acid, indicating that they are highly hydrophobic BAs (Fig. 3B).

By plotting our observed retention times against the BA hydrophobicity indices published by Heuman,11 we calculated an individual hydrophobicity index for each BA and then a total hydrophobicity index by using the molar fractions of BAs in each sample (Fig. 3B).

We showed that the BA composition was significantly more hydrophobic following OCA treatment (hydrophobicity index: OCA, 0.43 ± 0.09; placebo, 0.34 ± 0.07; p <0.05).

This increase in BA hydrophobicity combined with the decreased concentration of total gallbladder BAs likely shift the gallbladder lipid composition into a physicochemical state that promotes the initiation of cholesterol crystallization.10,11,15

SECTION

OCA increases gallbladder FGF19 which mainly originates from the gallbladder epithelium

PARAGRAPH

In our study, we observed 3-fold higher concentrations of gallbladder FGF19 in the OCA- versus placebo-treated patients (OCA, 40.3 ± 16.5; placebo, 13.5 ± 13.1 ng/ml; p <0.005).

In contrast to mice, which do not express FGF15 (the murine homolog of FGF19) in the hepatobiliary tract,14,16 FGF19 has recently been shown to be expressed in the liver of humans with extrahepatic cholestasis.16

Although RNA sequencing of gallbladder and liver tissue revealed FGF19 in both organs, FGF19 gene expression in the liver was low in both the OCA and placebo groups (Fig. 4A).

By contrast, there was a robust expression and induction of FGF19 in the gallbladder of the OCA-treated group (Fig. 4A).

Gene-specific qPCR analyses confirmed that FGF19 gene expression in both the OCA and placebo groups was low in the liver and higher in the gallbladder (Fig. 4B).

Furthermore, OCA treatment promoted a tendency to increase FGF19 in the gallbladder (Fig. 4B).

Given this trend and the fact that FGF19 gene expression was low in the liver, we propose that most gallbladder FGF19 is synthesized in loco.

Expression of the FXR target OSTα (encoded by SLC51A) was increased by OCA, confirming activation of FXR following OCA treatment (Fig. 4B).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In our randomized double-blind placebo-controlled pharmacodynamic trial of the BA-derived FXR agonist OCA, we tested the hypothesis that decreased synthesis and excretion of BAs from the liver would affect gallbladder lipid composition resulting in an increased risk of gallstone formation.

We found that OCA not only significantly increased the cholesterol saturation index but also the hydrophobicity index of the gallbladder bile acid composition, both established risk factors in gallstone pathogenesis.10,11,17

Furthermore, we found increased FGF19 in gallbladder bile.

Although the physiological function of FGF19 in human gallbladder is still undefined, the hypothesized role of FGF19 is gallbladder relaxation.16,18

This hypothesis is based on studies in mice where intravenously injected recombinant FGF15 or FGF19 has been shown to induce gallbladder relaxation and refilling.14

Biliary FGF19 may also modulate the secretion of mucin18,19 which is a nucleating factor for cholesterol gallstones.17

The formation of gallstones could thus be further facilitated by decreased gallbladder emptying resulting from an increase in biliary FGF19.

PARAGRAPH

Importantly, because all our patients had established symptomatic gallstone disease, we could not study cholesterol crystallization or perform kinetic analyses of gallbladder filling/relaxation.

However, these studies would have generated questionable findings as adjustments for number and size of stones within the gallbladder would have been necessary.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, this is the first report in humans describing a significant enrichment of FGF19 in gallbladder bile upon pharmacological FXR activation with OCA.

FGF19 might increase gallbladder filling and relaxation which, together with significantly increased cholesterol supersaturation and BA hydrophobicity, would further increase the risk of gallstone formation in susceptible individuals.

Therefore, increased vigilance is recommended.
