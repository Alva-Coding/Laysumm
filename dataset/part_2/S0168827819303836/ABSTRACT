ABSTRACT

TITLE

Obeticholic acid may increase the risk of gallstone formation in susceptible patients

PARAGRAPH

The nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist obeticholic acid (OCA) has been developed for the treatment of liver diseases.

We aimed to determine whether OCA treatment increases the risk of gallstone formation.

PARAGRAPH

Twenty patients awaiting laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized to treatment with OCA (25 mg/day) or placebo for 3 weeks until the day before surgery.

Serum bile acids (BAs), the BA synthesis marker C4 (7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one), and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) were measured before and after treatment.

During surgery, biopsies from the liver and the whole bile-filled gallbladder were collected for analyses of gene expression, biliary lipids and FGF19.

PARAGRAPH

In serum, OCA increased FGF19 (from 95.0 ± 8.5 to 234.4 ± 35.6 ng/L) and decreased C4 (from 31.4 ± 22.8 to 2.8 ± 4.0 nmol/L) and endogenous BAs (from 1,312.2 ± 236.2 to 517.7 ± 178.9 nmol/L; all p <0.05).

At surgery, BAs in gallbladder bile were lower in patients that received OCA than in controls (OCA, 77.9 ± 53.6 mmol/L; placebo, 196.4 ± 99.3 mmol/L; p <0.01), resulting in a higher cholesterol saturation index (OCA, 2.8 ± 1.1; placebo, 1.8 ± 0.8; p <0.05).

In addition, hydrophobic OCA conjugates accounted for 13.6 ± 5.0% of gallbladder BAs after OCA treatment, resulting in a higher hydrophobicity index (OCA, 0.43 ± 0.09; placebo, 0.34 ± 0.07, p <0.05).

Gallbladder FGF19 levels were 3-fold higher in OCA patients than in controls (OCA, 40.3 ± 16.5 ng/L; placebo, 13.5 ± 13.1 ng/ml; p <0.005).

Gene expression analysis indicated that FGF19 mainly originated from the gallbladder epithelium.

PARAGRAPH

Our results show for the first time an enrichment of FGF19 in human bile after OCA treatment.

In accordance with its murine homolog FGF15, FGF19 might trigger relaxation and filling of the gallbladder which, in combination with increased cholesterol saturation and BA hydrophobicity, would enhance the risk of gallstone development.
