TITLE

Obeticholic acid may increase the risk of gallstone formation in susceptible patients

PARAGRAPH

Obeticholic acid increased human gallbladder cholesterol saturation and bile acid hydrophobicity, both decreasing cholesterol solubility in bile.

Together with increased hepatobiliary levels of fibroblast growth factor 19, our findings suggest that pharmacological activation of the farnesoid X receptor increases the risk of gallstone formation.
