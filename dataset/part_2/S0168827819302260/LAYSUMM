TITLE

Incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in HIV/HBV-coinfected patients on tenofovir therapy: Relevance for screening strategies

PARAGRAPH

We investigated the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in HIV/hepatitis B virus-coinfected individuals from a large multi-cohort study in Europe.

Over 32,673 patient-years, 60 individuals (1.7%) developed hepatocellular carcinoma.

The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma remained low in patients without cirrhosis, who started on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate when aged <46â€¯years old.
