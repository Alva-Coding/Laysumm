TITLE

Multi-organ assessment of compensated cirrhosis patients using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging

PARAGRAPH

This study assesses the changes to structure, blood flow and perfusion that occur in the key organs (liver, spleen and kidney) associated with severe liver disease (Compensated Cirrhosis), using magnetic resonance imaging.

The magnetic resonance imaging measures which changed with disease severity and were related to negative liver-related clinical outcomes are described.
