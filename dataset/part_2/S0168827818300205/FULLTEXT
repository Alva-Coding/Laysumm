TITLE

Hepatocyte-specific deletion of IL1-RI attenuates liver injury by blocking IL-1 driven autoinflammation

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Acute liver failure (ALF) and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) both lead to a high mortality rate, with limited treatment options available.

An altered inflammatory response has been implicated in their pathophysiology.1,2

Despite obvious differences in their etiology, both conditions exhibit activation of immune mechanisms that augment inflammation after the initial insult and drive a lethal loss of hepatic function from increased cell death.

In order to improve the poor prognosis of patients with ALF and ACLF, mechanistic studies that address the underlying pathomechanisms are urgently required with the aim of identifying potential, selective immune-modulatory therapies.

PARAGRAPH

The interleukin (IL)-1 family members IL-1α and IL-1β are key pro-inflammatory mediators and signal through the cell surface interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1).3

Upon binding of IL-1α/β, IL-1R1 recruits, in complex with its receptor accessory protein (IL-1RacP), the cytosolic adapter molecule myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and through an intracellular signaling complex IL-1R-associated kinases (IRAK) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6).4

These in turn activate transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) that are involved in cellular survival, e.g. c-Jun terminal kinases (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK), as well as downstream transcriptions factors that contribute to hepatic inflammation.5

PARAGRAPH

The role of IL-1 signaling in ALF is controversial and differs between studied models.

Aggravation of ALF from acetaminophen (APAP) related to IL-1 signaling is supported by observations in transgenic mice, studies using recombinant human IL-1ra anakinra to block the effects of IL-1α/β6,7 and studies exploring the role of toll-like receptors (TLRs).8

In particular, IL-1α, but not IL-1β, released from Kupffer cells following hepatocellular injury seems to amplify hepatic inflammation.6

IL-1β has received special attention, as NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NALP3/NLRP3) inflammasome-mediated maturation of IL-1β through caspase 1 has been implied in different liver disease models.9–11

Meanwhile, genetic disruption of IL-1R targeting Il1r112 failed to protect from a lethal dose of D-galactosamine (D-GalN) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS),13 while it protected from acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury and inflammation.

Others have not observed an alteration of injury when IL-1β was given to C57Bl/6 mice in addition to APAP.14

Moreover, major controversies regarding cell-type specific functions of IL-1 signaling and especially the functional role of IL-1R1 in hepatocytes remain unanswered.8

Recently a single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the IL1 gene cluster was linked to the severity of ACLF in clinical cohorts.15

Based on the central involvement of IL-1 in the regulation of inflammation, we tested the hypothesis, that the hepatic IL-1R1 is centrally involved in the pathophysiology of inflammatory liver failure in a novel transgenic mouse model with hepatocyte-restricted deletion of all IL-1R isoforms.

SECTION

Animal model and primary hepatocytes

PARAGRAPH

The targeting strategy for Il1r1 gene disruption has recently been described.16

In conditional Il1r1 mutant mice (Il1r1flox/flox), exon 5 of the Il1r1 gene, encoding amino-acids 166-222 and corresponding to half of the Ig-like C2 type 2 region that encodes parts of the extracellular binding region of full length IL-1R1 and truncated IL-1R3, was flanked by loxP sites.

This lead to a transcriptional frame shift and inactivation of the two functional Il1r1 gene transcripts after Cre-mediated recombination.

Hepatocyte-specific deletion of all signaling IL-1R isoforms was achieved by crossing Il1r1flox/flox mice C57Bl6 with mice expressing Cre-recombinase under an albumin promoter resulting in albumin-cre:Il1r1flox/flox mice.

Mice carrying homozygous floxed Il1r1 and albumin-cre (Il1r1Hep−/−) were compared to their Cre-negative control littermates, which are referred to as wild-type (WT) mice.

Genotypic identification was carried out by PCR as previously described for Il1r1−/− mice and Cre genotyping.16

All animals were held and bred with free access to food and water at 12 h light/dark cycles at the animal facility of the University Medical Center Mainz, according to the criteria outlined by the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals”.

Studies were approved by the committee for experimental animal research (Landesuntersuchungsamt Rheinland-Pfalz) and were designed according to the ARRIVE guidelines.17

Results

SECTION

Analysis of IL-1R1 in hepatocytes

PARAGRAPH

To study the functional role of IL-1R1 and the loss of IL-1 mediated signaling in hepatocytes in vivo, we generated hepatocyte-specific Il1r1 knockout mice (Il1r1Hep−/−) using the cre-loxP system under control of the albumin promoter (Fig. 1A).

Analyses by qRT-PCR confirmed a 99.5% reduction of Il1r1 mRNA expression in primary hepatocytes derived from Il1r1Hep−/− mice at the age of 10–12 weeks, whereas the Il1r1 mRNA expression in other liver resident cells was unchanged (Fig. 1B).

Immunoblotting indicated a significant reduction of IL-1R1 protein in Il1r1Hep−/− hepatocytes compared to WT mice (Fig. 1C).

In vitro stimulation of Il1r1Hep−/− hepatocytes with rmIL-1α failed to induce IL-1R1 and the IL-1 target genes Il1a, Il1rn, Il6 and Ccl2 (Fig. 1D), while LPS was able to induce transcript levels of these genes irrespective of IL-1R1.

Likewise, the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α from cultured Il1r1Hep−/− hepatocytes in the presence of rmIL-1α was impaired, while LPS induced the secretion of these cytokines in cultured hepatocytes irrespective of the genotype (Fig. 1E).

Thus, we were able to establish a hepatocyte-restricted model, with functional loss of IL-1R1 signaling without affecting downstream mechanisms.

SECTION

Conditional deletion of Il1r1 in hepatocytes prevents liver injury and caspase activation from D-GalN/LPS

PARAGRAPH

Conditional knockout of Il1r1 in hepatocytes did not produce a spontaneous phenotype compared to WT littermates, until the age of six months (Table S1A and B, Fig. 2B and C).

Next, D-GalN/LPS was employed to examine the functional role of IL-1R1 in hepatocytes during ALF.

D-GalN/LPS induced an upregulation of IL-1R1 in the hepatic tissue of WT mice that was not seen in Il1r1Hep−/− mice (Fig. 2A).

Strikingly, conditional ablation of the Il1r1 in hepatocytes significantly ameliorated liver injury and cell death.

Compared to the WT, ALT and AST activities, as well as LDH levels, were significantly decreased in Il1r1Hep−/− mice at 4 h (Fig. 2B and Fig. S1).

Liver histology showed decreased inflammation, a reduction in the number of polymorphonuclear cells (Fig. 2C and Table S2) and reduced activation of caspase 3 (Fig. 2D and E).

The overall mortality in this model was high irrespective of the genotype (Fig. S2) and over time liver injury increased and was not significantly different between the two genotypes (Fig. S3A).

Using D-GalN and a low-dose of LPS, mortality in Il1r1Hep−/− was significantly decreased (median survival Il1r1Hep−/− vs. WT: 8.75 vs. 7.17 p <0.03; Fig. 2F).

Thus, the functional loss of IL-1R1 in hepatocytes is critical for caspase-dependent cell death and survival from ALF induced by D-GalN/LPS.

SECTION

Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Il1r1 inhibits JNK/c-Jun activation through increased NF-κB p65 activity

PARAGRAPH

Tumor necrosis factor-α-induced cell death in hepatocytes involves prolonged activation of JNK.22

In Il1r1Hep−/− mice phosphorylation of the p46 and p54 JNK isoforms and activation of the downstream transcription factor c-Jun were significantly decreased in response to D-GalN/LPS at 4 h, without affecting levels of total JNK, respectively c-Jun protein (Fig. 3A and B).

Furthermore, D-GalN/LPS-treated WT mice exhibited increased levels of phospho-ERK compared to Il1r1Hep−/− mice, while changes in p38 MAPK were less pronounced with no differences between genotypes (Fig. 3C).

PARAGRAPH

NF-κB can act both pro- or anti-inflammatory in response to LPS, and controls survival of hepatocytes during inflammation.

Accumulating evidence has shown that NF-κB exerts cytoprotective effects by suppressing JNK activation.23

In response to D-GalN/LPS expression of the p65 (RelA) protein decreased significantly in the WT, while it remained unaffected in Il1r1Hep−/− mice (Fig. 3D).

In parallel, Il1r1Hep−/− mice retained phosphorylation of p65 at serine residue 536 (Fig. 3D) and exhibited a significant higher NF-κB p65 binding using a functional assay at 4 h (Fig. 3E).

Taken together, these results indicate that IL-1R1 affects the activity of NF-κB and inflammation-related MAPKs.

Deletion of Il1r1 protected hepatocytes from the deleterious loss of NF-κB p65 activity from D-GalN/LPS.

The severity of liver injury aggravated over time and the protection observed in Il1r1Hep−/− mice was lost at 6 h (Fig. S3A–C).

SECTION

The role of IL-1R1 in TNF-α-mediated cell death in vitro and in vivo

PARAGRAPH

In contrast to the findings in vivo, isolated hepatocytes treated with actinomycin D (ActD) and TNF-α showed comparable JNK activation and cell death at 24 h (Fig. 4A).

Cellular injury was partially inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD, the caspase 1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-cmk and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 with no difference between genotypes.

As these data suggest that TNF-α-induced cell death of hepatocytes in vitro does not depend on IL-1R1 signaling, we tested whether the addition of exogenous IL-1R1 ligands boosts hepatocellular death.

Interestingly rmIL-1α - but not rmIL-1β – aggravated TNF-α-induced cell death in WT but not Il1r1Hep−/− hepatocytes (Fig. 4B).

In line with these findings, exogenously administered rmIL-1α acted as an inflammatory amplifier during ALF in vivo.

Injection of rmIL-1α following application of D-GalN/LPS significantly augmented liver injury in WT mice, while rmIL-1β did not (Fig. 4C).

These data demonstrate that other inflammatory mediators and/or immune cells are required to trigger TNF-α-mediated hepatocyte injury in vivo.

SECTION

Hepatic and systemic cytokines and chemokines are modulated by IL-1R1 on hepatocytes

PARAGRAPH

Next inflammatory and chemotactic cytokines were examined in vivo.

Following D-GalN/LPS injection, TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-gamma and the monocyte-attractant CCL2 increased in the serum at 4 h (Fig. 5A).

This increase was markedly more pronounced in the WT, suggesting that the extent of liver injury could be related to the cytokine response.

In liver tissue expression of Il1a, Il1b, Il6, Ifng and Ccl2, but not Tnf transcript levels were likewise attenuated in Il1r1Hep−/− mice in response D-GalN/LPS (Fig. 5B).

Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 mRNA encoding the neutrophil-attractant chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) and 2 (CXCL2) were also significantly lower in Il1r1Hep−/− mice.

These data suggest that loss of IL-1R1 in hepatocytes blunts the inflammatory and chemotactic cytokines response following liver injury.

SECTION

Neutrophil recruitment during D-GalN/LPS injury depends on IL-1R1 signaling in hepatocytes

PARAGRAPH

Decreased cytokine levels could be associated with reduced leukocyte migration into the liver following D-GalN/LPS injection.

At baseline, Il1r1Hep−/− mice and WT littermates did not differ with respect to the number and composition of intrahepatic immune cells (data not shown).

Following D-GalN/LPS leukocyte and especially neutrophil recruitment was detectable, that was largely abolished in the absence of the hepatocellular IL-1R1.

Accordingly, the D-GalN/LPS-induced increase of hepatic Ptprc, Elane and Mpo gene expression encoding the leukocyte-antigen CD45, the neutrophil expressed elastase (ELANE) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) was significantly attenuated in Il1r1Hep−/− mice (Fig. 6A).

Quantification of living intrahepatic CD45+Ly-6 G+ cells by FACS revealed a significant increase that was only seen in WT mice, while the increase of CD45+F4/80+ macrophages occurred independently of the genotype (Fig. 6B).

Moreover, transcript levels of Tlr4 and Myd88 (Fig. 6C) and TLR4 protein levels (Fig. 6D) in hepatic tissue were comparable.

SECTION

NLRP3-dependent caspase 1 activity is reduced in Il1r1Hep−/− mice

PARAGRAPH

Both IL-1α as well as IL-1β provide a positive feed-forward stimulation involving the IL-1R1 and control their own precursors, the synthesis of inflammasome components as well as other inflammatory cytokines by post translational processing and can amplify inflammation.24

In hepatocytes, in which inflammasome-dependent caspase 1 activation was described,10,25 both IL-1 molecules are potent priming signals for the induction of Nlrp3 and Casp1 mRNA encoding NLRP3 and caspase 1 (Fig. S4A and B).

Based on the previous observations, it was assumed that IL-1R1-deficiency leads to the inhibition of an auto- resp.

paracrine signaling loop that involves inflammasome activation.

The hepatic mRNA levels of Nlrp3 and Casp1 were markedly increased at 4 h after D-GalN/LPS in WT mice and significantly lower in Il1r1Hep−/− mice (Fig. 7A).

Accordingly, immunoblotting and caspase 1 enzyme assays revealed D-GalN/LPS-induced caspase 1 activation only in the WT (Fig. 7B and C).

Also, increasing gasdermin D and the cytotoxic N-terminal p30 fragment - that is produced by caspase 1 activation - was detectable only in WT mice (Fig. 7D).

Specificity of the p30 protein band was confirmed by using J774 macrophages, in which caspase 1-mediated pyroptosis was induced upon activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by LPS plus ATP or nigericin (Fig. S5A–C).

Moreover, rmIL-1β addition to LPS-primed primary hepatocyte cultures resulted in a significant increase of IL-1α protein secretion after exposure to ATP that was not detectable in IL-1R1-deficient hepatocytes (Fig. 7E), while LDH release ex vivo was not different (Fig. S5D).

In conclusion, the results show that IL-1R1-deficiency in hepatocytes affects NLRP3-dependent pathways, limits pyroptotic cell death and the release of inflammatory mediators like which augment hepatic inflammation.

SECTION

Modulation of hepatotoxicity by inhibitory IL-1ra

PARAGRAPH

Our data implicate that the IL-1R1 plays a critical role in the onset of ALF and thus presents a potential therapeutic target.

Therefore, we tested whether blocking IL-1 signaling by treatment with the recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) anakinra is capable of modulating liver injury from D-GalN/LPS.

Administration of IL-1ra in doses of 50 µg/g bodyweight 30 min prior to D-GalN/LPS application prevented liver injury in WT mice, evident by significantly decreased ALT and AST after 4 h (Fig. 8A).

In contrast, pretreatment with IL-1ra in doses of 100 µg/g bodyweight or 10 µg/g bodyweight was equally respectively less effective in lowering transaminases (data not shown).

Application of anakinra following the injection of D-GalN/LPS also failed to rescue the liver phenotype (Fig. 8A).

While overall survival was not prolonged by a single injection of IL-1ra (Fig. 8B), repeated application of IL-1ra showed a trend towards prolonged median survival time without reaching significance (median survival: D-GalN/LPS vs. D-GalN/LPS+IL-1ra pre vs. D-GalN/LPS+IL-1ra pre and post: 8.10 vs. 7.41 vs. 9.75 h).

These results indicate that blockade of IL-1 signaling confers protection against D-GalN/LPS-induced hepatotoxicity.

However, its effects are strongly dependent on the time point and dose of administration.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Acute liver failure exhibits a high mortality and therapeutic options are still limited.

Recent studies proposed a role of IL-1 signaling in the pathogenesis of ALF8 and have identified macrophage-derived IL-1α as a critical modulator in APAP-induced hepatotoxicity.6

The role of IL-1R1 in hepatocytes remained controversial.

We employed a conditional Il1r1 knockout model exhibiting deletion of exon 5 and thus all signaling-capable IL-1R isoforms specifically in hepatocytes to further explore its role in the pathophysiology of liver disease.

IL-1R1 deficiency was evident both at the level of mRNA and protein expression in hepatocytes and functional assays ex vivo.

Importantly, the current model allowed us to specifically assess the role of IL-1R1 in hepatocytes, while retaining intact cell surface expression of IL-1R1 in non-parenchymal cells.

Up to the age of six months no spontaneous phenotypical differences were observed.

These mice differ from the published Il1r1 knockout model that exhibits a deletion of exon 1 and 2 and retained residual IL-1 signaling capacity.26

PARAGRAPH

The central findings in the current study are a marked reduction of liver injury, caspase and MAPK activation in mice lacking the IL-1R1 in hepatocytes and reduced mortality from D-GalN/LPS.

These effects appear to be secondary to reduced release of cytokines and chemokines in vivo and are accompanied by increased activity of p65 NF-κB.

In the absence of IL-1R1 reduced levels of TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-gamma, CCL2, CXCL-1 and CXCL-2, were detectable both in the serum, as well as hepatic tissue.

Interestingly, exogenous IL-1α but not IL-1β, was able to augment TNF-α-mediated liver injury in WT mice.

This effect was also observed ex vivo arguing for an amplification of TNF-α-mediated liver injury by IL-1R1.

Importantly, TLR4 and the response to TLR4 ligands were not impaired in Il1r1 knockout hepatocytes.

Therefore, we assume that IL-1α and to a lesser extent IL-1β - released from dying hepatocytes, as well as activated immune cells – ultimately contribute to the activation of the IL-1R1 signaling pathway in hepatocytes and promote a pro-injurious, inflammatory response.

PARAGRAPH

Although the current study did not investigate differential signal transduction of IL-1α and IL-1β, it is well established that both IL-1 molecules trigger inflammation through IL-1R1 involving MyD88 activation and culminating in NF-κB-induced transcription of inflammatory genes including their own precursors; inflammasome components and chemokines.24

This promotes chemotaxis and influx of neutrophils in the liver in response to injury, which was significantly suppressed in the hepatocyte-specific knockout mice.

The ability of IL-1R1 to trigger neutrophilic infiltration is not restricted to the hepatic tissue, but has also been observed in other inflammatory models.27

This type of immune cell activation has been termed sterile inflammation.28

A comparable effect of neutrophils during sterile inflammation has been described in a variety of liver injury models and hepatic fibrosis.29

Our data suggest that inhibition of IL-1R1 in hepatocytes attenuates the attraction of neutrophils during cellular injury and thereby prevents ‘collateral damage’ that would further augment cell death.

Interestingly, macrophages did not seem to be involved to the same extent in the current analysis.

Previous studies have shown that IL-1R1 is required for APAP-induced liver injury and neutrophilic inflammation but not for monocyte recruitment.8

As discussed above, no immediate involvement of IL-1β was noticeable in the current model and other studies have linked IL-1β to later stages of inflammation, which are characterized by the retention of macrophages, but not neutrophils.8,28

PARAGRAPH

The NLRP3 inflammasome and specifically caspase 1 activation play an important role in the regulation of inflammatory cell death – a process called pyroptosis – and regulate inflammatory and immune reactions in response to dying cells.30

Interestingly, caspase 1-knockout mice, which are incapable of producing IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-18, are resistant to LPS-induced sepsis,31 while loss of IL-1β or IL-18 is not sufficient to prevent LPS-induced injury.32

In the Il1r1 hepatocyte-knockout model, the induction of NLRP3 inflammasome components, caspase 1 activation and gasdermin D cleavage were significantly suppressed.

Although the specific contribution of NLRP3-dependent caspase 1 activation in hepatocytes vs. non-parenchymal liver cells during ALF and the role of pyroptotic hepatocyte death have not yet been fully explored, our data suggests a synergy between IL-1 and LPS signaling pathways – including NLRP3 inflammasome effector mechanisms – which is lost in absence of IL-1R1.

As previous studies have suggested an inflammasome-mediated release of danger signals to stimulate immune cells in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, the findings in the Il1r1 knockout mice could have a broader implication in the pathophysiology of liver disease.10

A comparable mechanism of inflammatory signal amplification involving IL-1R1 has recently also been proposed for alveolar macrophages.33

The importance of immune cell activation was confirmed in ex vivo analysis, when caspase 1 inhibition using a molecular inhibitor reduced cell death from TNF-α/ActD irrespective of the underlying genotype.

The current data strongly suggests, that the IL-1R1 signal in hepatocytes is a critical coactivator in vivo that promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as it has previously been observed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.34

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, the current study suggests that IL-1R1 in hepatocytes acts to amplify acute, inflammatory liver injury through immune cell recruitment and activation with amplification of hepatocellular death.

These findings underline the importance of IL-1 signaling as potential therapeutic target in acute liver disease and blocking IL-1R1 signaling could be an approach to improve the poor overall outcome in ALF – if the timing is right.
