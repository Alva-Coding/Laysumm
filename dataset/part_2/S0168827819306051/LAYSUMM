TITLE

Perioperative omega-3 fatty acids fail to confer protection in liver surgery: Results of a multicentric, double-blind, randomized controlled trial

PARAGRAPH

Despite strong evidence of omega-3 fatty acids having liver-directed, anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative action in various rodent models, 2 single omega-3 fatty acid infusions given to patients before and during liver surgery failed to reduce complications.

Because single omega-3 fatty acid infusions failed to confer liver protection in this trial, they cannot currently be recommended.
