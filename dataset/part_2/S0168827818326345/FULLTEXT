TITLE

The long non-coding RNA LncHDAC2 drives the self-renewal of liver cancer stem cells via activation of Hedgehog signaling

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of primary liver cancer, is one of the leading causes of cancer death globally.

The highest incidence of HCC is in East and South-East Asia and Northern and Western Africa.1

However, the incidence of liver cancer, including HCC, has risen in areas with historically low rates, for instance, Western Europe, Northern America and parts of Oceania.

Infection with hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, as well as metabolic disorders, are etiologically responsible for HCC.2

The high rate of recurrence and heterogeneity render HCC intractable.3

Therefore, the mechanism underlying liver carcinogenesis remain elusive.

PARAGRAPH

Most human tumors exhibit cellular heterogeneity due to inherently high genetic instability, resulting in the evolution of cells with the capacity of tumor initiation.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) refer to a subset of tumor cells with many phenotypic and functional properties of normal stem cells, including the ability of self-renewal and differentiation.4–6

Numerous cell surface markers have been identified to isolate liver CSCs, including CD13, CD133, EpCAM, CD24, CD90 and CD44.7,8

CSCs display some characteristics of embryonic or tissue stem cells, and typically harbor persistent activation of one or more highly conserved stemness signaling pathways, such as Hedgehog (Hh), Notch, and Wnt pathways.9–11

Activation of the Hh signaling pathway is implicated in the initiation of distinct cancers of the liver, brain, muscle and skin.12–15

The Hh ligands include Sonic (Shh), Desert (Dhh) and Indian (Ihh) Hh, which initiate a signaling cascade via binding with their common receptor Patched 1 (PTCH1).16

Following Hh engagement, PTCH1 stops inhibiting the regulatory transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo), allowing it to migrate to the tip of the primary cilium and activate Gli transcription factors that drive tumor initiation.17

However, how Hh signaling regulates liver CSCs remains largely unknown.

PARAGRAPH

Over the past 2 decades, overwhelming evidence has demonstrated the regulatory roles of different classes of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in liver carcinogenesis.18,19

Among these ncRNAs, transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides are termed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).

LncRNAs are involved in a wide range of biological processes.20–22

We recently defined several lncRNAs that promote the self-renewal of human liver cancer stem cells.23–25

In this study, we identified another highly expressed lncRNA in primary liver CSCs that we called lncHDAC2 (lncRNA for association with HDAC2, gene symbol ENST00000601096).

LncHDAC2 associates with HDAC2 to suppress PTCH1 expression, which activates Hh signaling and sustains the stemness of liver CSCs.

Results

SECTION

LncHDAC2 is highly expressed in liver CSCs

PARAGRAPH

We previously identified several lncRNAs from liver CSCs of HCC cell lines and defined their roles in the modulation of liver CSC stemness.23–25

To further identify physiological lncRNAs involved in liver CSCs, we conducted transcriptome microarray analysis of CD13+CD133+ cells (hereafter called liver CSCs) and CD13-CD133- cells (referred to as non-CSCs) sorted from 3 HCC primary tumor tissues (Fig. S1A).

Indeed, CD13+CD133+ cells harbored stemness capacity through oncosphere formation, stemness analysis and tumor formation in xenograft models (Fig. S1B–D).

Through analysis of these transcriptome profiles, 665 upregulated and 412 downregulated lncRNAs were identified (Fig. 1A).

Among the top 20 upregulated intergenic lncRNAs in liver CSCs, we focused on the lncHDAC2 (gene symbol: ENST00000601096), whose depletion most significantly suppressed oncosphere formation (Fig. 1B).

LncHDAC2, located on chromosome 9 in humans, containing 2 exons and comprised 834 nucleotides (Fig. 1C), whose full-length was further amplified by RACE (rapid-amplification of cDNA ends) and validated by sequencing (Fig. S2A).

In addition, lncHDAC2 showed no protein coding potentiality (Fig. S2B, C).

LncHDAC2 was expressed in HCC primary tumor tissues through in situ hybridization (Fig. 1D) and further validated by Northern blot (Fig. 1E).

PARAGRAPH

Owing to high expression levels of lncHDAC2 in liver CSCs based on transcriptome data, we next verified lncHDAC2 expression in liver CSCs from HCC primary samples.

We found that lncHDAC2 was indeed highly expressed in liver CSCs derived from HCC primary samples (Fig. S2D).

We noticed that lncHDAC2 was also highly expressed in oncosphere cells derived from HCC primary samples and HCC cell lines (Fig. 1F, G and Fig. S2E, F).

In addition, lncHDAC2 mainly located in the nuclei of HCC cells by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) (Fig. 1F).

These observations were further validated by nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation of liver CSCs (Fig. 1H and Fig. S2G).

Altogether, lncHDAC2 is expressed in HCC tumor tissues and highly expressed in liver CSCs.

SECTION

LncHDAC2 promotes the self-renewal of liver CSCs

PARAGRAPH

We next wanted to explore the role of lncHDAC2 in the self-renewal of liver CSCs.

We depleted lncHDAC2 in 6 HCC primary tumor cells by ASOs (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3A), followed by sphere-formation assays.

We observed that lncHDAC2 depletion markedly inhibited sphere formation (Fig. 2A).

Reduced self-renewal capacity was further validated in lncHDAC2 silenced cells through serial sphere-formation assays (Fig. 2B).

We also established lncHDAC2 KO cells (Fig. S3B) and injected 1 × 106 lncHDAC2 KO and sgCtrl cells into BALB/c nude mice, followed by measurement of tumor volumes every 4 days.

LncHDAC2 KO cells significantly reduced tumor propagation compared to sgCtrl treated cells (Fig. 2C).

Furthermore, lncHDAC2 KO displayed much weaker tumor initiation and tumorigenic cell frequency as assayed by a limiting dilution xenograft analysis (Fig. 2D).

These data suggest that lncHDAC2 deletion impairs the stemness of liver CSCs.

PARAGRAPH

We then established lncHDAC2 stably overexpressing HCC primary cells via lentivirus and examined oncosphere formation and self-renewal capacities.

We found that lncHDAC2 overexpression promoted in vitro oncosphere formation (Fig. 2E, F), as well as augmented in vivo tumor propagation and tumorigenic cell frequency (Fig. 2G, H).

Taken together, lncHDAC2 promotes the self-renewal of liver CSCs and in vivo tumor propagation.

SECTION

LncHDAC2 associates with HDAC2 in liver CSCs

PARAGRAPH

LncRNAs are considered to exert their regulatory functions in trans or in cis.26–28

Of note, we observed that lncHDAC2 depletion did not impact the expression of its nearby genes (Fig. S4A), suggesting that lncHDAC2 exerts its function in trans.

RNA antisense purification has been used as a critical strategy to identify RNA-binding proteins.29

We then screened probes against lncHDAC2 transcript with RNase H treatment and labeled them with digoxin.

These labeled probes were incubated with oncosphere cell lysates and analyzed by silver staining (Fig. 3A).

With mass spectrometry, the differential band binding to lncHDAC2 was identified to be HDAC2, a major component of the NuRD remodeling complex.30,31

The interaction of lncHDAC2 with HDAC2 was further confirmed by western blot (Fig. 3B) and RNA immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 3C).

The co-localization of lncHDAC2 with HDAC2 in oncosphere cells derived from HCC primary cells was validated by immunofluorescence staining and mainly distributed in the nucleus (Fig. 3D).

A stable stem-loop structure at the lncHDAC2 exon1 was predicted by RNA folding analysis (Fig. S4B).

Through domain mapping, we identified that region of lncHDAC2 exon1 (nucleotide 1–364) was necessary and sufficient to bind HDAC2 (Fig. 3E).

LncHDAC2 depletion impaired the self-renewal and tumor propagation capacity of HCC primary cells (Fig. 2A, C).

However, overexpression of mutant lncHDAC2 without the HDAC2 binding domain in lncHDAC2 depleted cells failed to rescue the phenotype (Fig. 3F, G).

Altogether, lncHDAC2 interacts with HDAC2 in liver CSCs.

SECTION

LncHDAC2 recruits the NuRD complex onto the promoter of PTCH1 gene to suppress its expression

PARAGRAPH

We next detected expression levels of main self-renewal-related pathways in lncHDAC2 KO oncosphere cells.

We found that lncHDAC2 deletion dramatically suppressed Hh signaling (Fig. 4A).

Through ChIRP assay, we found that lncHDAC2 was enriched on the 1,200–1,400 bp region of the PTCH1 promoter, upstream of the transcriptional start site (Fig. 4B).

By contrast, lncHDAC2 did not bind to other gene promoters of Hh signaling target genes (Fig. S5).

We thus focused on the PTCH1 gene in the regulation of Hh signaling mediated by lncHDAC2 in liver CSCs.

In addition, HDAC2 also bound to the same region of PTCH1 promoter as lncHDAC2 did via ChIP assay (Fig. 4C).

Of note, the interaction of lncHDAC2 and HDAC2 with the PTCH1 promoter was validated by the EMSA assay (Fig. 4D).

With cross-linking treatment, lncHDAC2 was co-eluted with the NuRD complex in oncosphere lysates via ChIP and ChIRP assays (Fig. 4E, F).

We also noticed that lncHDAC2 or HDAC2 deletion significantly facilitated PTCH1 promoter activation by DNase I sensitivity assays (Fig. 4G).

To confirm that PTCH1 was suppressed by lncHDAC2 and HDAC2, we performed luciferase reporter assays.

We observed that lncHDAC2 and HDAC2 bound to PTCH1 promoter, whereas the mutant lncHDAC2 without HDAC2 binding domain did not (Fig. 4H).

In parallel, anti-HDAC2 antibody did not enrich on the PTCH1 promoter region in lncHDAC2 KO oncospheres (Fig. 4I).

As a consequence, H4K5 and H3K9 acetylation levels were improved (Fig. 4J).

Overexpression of lncHDAC2 in lncHDAC2 deleted cells could rescue the phenotypes, while overexpression of the mutant lncHDAC2 failed (Fig. 4I, J).

These data indicate that lncHDAC2 recruits the NuRD complex onto the promoter of PTCH1 gene to suppress its expression.

SECTION

LncHDAC2-mediated PTCH1 downregulation promotes Hh signaling activation and drives the self-renewal of liver CSCs

PARAGRAPH

PTCH1 is a twelve-pass transporter-like Hh receptor that prevents the 7-transmembrane protein Smo from coupling to Gli transcription factors.32

We deleted HDAC2 and PTCH1 in HCC primary cells and HCC cell lines (Fig. S6A, B).

We found that PTCH1 deletion augmented Smo activity, whereas lncHDAC2 or HDAC2 deletion decreased the activity of Smo by GloSensor cAMP assay33 (Fig. 5A).

The absence of HDAC2 promotes proteasomal degradation of the Gli transcription factors GLI2 and GLI3, resulting in increased production of their corresponding repressor forms, GLI2R and GLI3R.34,35

Of note, we showed that PTCH1 deletion decreased GliR levels, whereas lncHDAC2 or HDAC2 deletion increased the GliR levels (Fig. 5B).

In addition, we found that GLI2 was strongly stained in the nuclei of liver CSCs by immunohistochemical staining (Fig. S7A).

Through RNA-FISH assay, GLI2 was co-localized with lncHDAC2 in oncosphere cells (Fig. S7B), suggesting that lncHDAC2 activates Hh signaling.

Consequently, PTCH1 deletion promoted downstream target genes of Hh signaling, while lncHDAC2 or HDAC2 deletion suppressed these target genes (Fig. 5C).

We next deleted the HDAC2-binding region of PTCH1 promoter (PTCH1 PKO) using a CRISPR/Cas9 approach.

As expected, PTCH1 PKO cells could promote oncosphere formation and tumor propagation capacity (Fig. 5D-F, Fig. S8A).

In PTCH1 PKO cells, lncHDAC2 depletion has no effect on oncosphere formation and tumor propagation capacity (Fig. 5D-F, Fig. S8A), suggesting lncHDAC2-mediated promotion of liver CSC self-renewal is dependent on the PTCH1 expression.

Since cyclopamine is a specific inhibitor against Smo, we then used cyclopamine to treat cells for oncosphere formation assays.

We observed that cyclopamine treatment could impair PTCH1 deletion-induced oncosphere formation and tumor propagation capacity (Fig. 5G-I), suggesting PTCH1-mediated Hh signaling is required for the self-renewal of liver CSCs.

Collectively, lncHDAC2-mediated PTCH1 downregulation promotes Hh signaling activation and drives the self-renewal of liver CSCs and tumor propagation.

SECTION

HDAC2 and PTCH1 expression levels are related to HCC severity

PARAGRAPH

We analyzed the expression levels of HDAC2 using online available data sets.

We noticed that HDAC2 was highly expressed in HCC tumors, especially in tumors with high rates of metastasis (Fig. 6A).

High expression levels of HDAC2 in HCC tumors also appeared in the TCGA dataset (Fig. S9A).

In parallel, expression levels of HDAC2 were also positively related to HCC severity (Fig. 6B).

These observations were further validated by examination of HCC samples with immunoblotting (Fig. 6D) and immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 6E).

Moreover, HDAC2 was highly expressed in oncosphere cells by western blot (Fig. 6F) and immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 6G).

As components of the NuRD complex, HDAC1 and CHD3 were also highly expressed in HCC and liver CSCs (Fig. 6D, F).

High expression levels of HDAC1 and CHD3 in HCC tumors also displayed in TCGA dataset (Fig. S9A).

In addition, patients with HCC and higher expression of HDAC2 displayed worse prognosis in Wang’s cohort (GSE14520) (Fig. 6C).

Finally, HDAC2 deletion or suppression markedly suppressed in vitro oncosphere formation as well as in vivo tumor propagation (Fig. 6H, I, Fig. S9B, C).

These data indicate that HDAC2 expression levels are positively related to HCC severity.

PARAGRAPH

Based on analysis of Wang’s cohort (GSE14520) and the TCGA dataset, we found that PTCH1 was poorly expressed in patients with HCC (Fig. 6J, Fig. S9D).

This observation was verified by examination of HCC samples and oncospheres with immunoblotting (Fig. 6K, M) and immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 6L), indicating that PTCH1 expression levels are negatively related to HCC severity.

Altogether, HDAC2 and PTCH1 expression levels are related to HCC severity.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Nowadays, the CSC model has been verified in a variety of solid tumors.4,36,37

These CSCs within tumor bulk display the capacity to self-renew, differentiate, and give rise to a new tumor.38,39

We previously isolated a small subpopulation from HCC cell lines and HCC samples with 2 combined surface makers (CD13 and CD133) and defined this subset of CD13+CD133+ cells as liver CSCs.8,40

In this study, we identified a lncRNA termed lncHDAC2 that is highly expressed in HCC tumors and liver CSCs.

LncHDAC2 is required for the self-renewal of liver CSCs and tumor propagation.

In liver CSCs, lncHDAC2 interacts with HDAC2, which recruits the NuRD complex onto the promoter of PTCH1 inhibiting its expression and leading to activation of Hh signaling.

Moreover, HDAC2 expression levels are positively related to HCC severity and PTCH1 levels are negatively related to HCC severity.

PARAGRAPH

The non-coding RNA family includes more than 16 categories of long and short RNA molecules with different functional and structural characteristics.41–43

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that are 5′ capped and 3′ polyadenylated, yet this class of transcripts has weak coding potential.

Accumulating evidence shows that a bunch of lncRNAs are implicated in the regulation of tumorigenesis.44

We previously identified several lncRNAs from liver CSCs of HCC cell lines and revealed their roles in the regulation of liver CSC stemness.23–25

To further identify physiological lncRNAs involved in liver CSCs, we conducted transcriptome microarray analysis of liver CSCs and non-CSCs sorted from 3 HCC primary tumor tissues.

Among the most upregulated lncRNAs, we identified lncHDAC2 which promotes the self-renewal of liver CSCs by initiating Hh signaling pathway activation.

Of note, lncHDAC2 depletion by ASOs markedly reduced the self-renewal capacity of liver CSCs.

We found that lnc-β-Catm was highly expressed in HCC sample #2 of the 3 HCC primary tumor tissues used for the transcriptome assay.

Since there is great heterogeneity in HCC, some lncRNAs are only expressed in certain populations of patients with HCC.

In addition, we observed that lncHDAC2 knockdown did not affect the expression levels of lncTCF7, lnc-β-Catm, and lncBrm.

Meanwhile, knockdown of lncTCF7, lnc-β-Catm, or lncBrm did not influence the expression level of lncHDAC2 and did not impact Hh signaling in liver CSCs either.

These data suggest that these lncRNAs have redundant functions in the regulation of liver CSC stemness.

Here we showed that lncHDAC2 bound to the 1,200–1,400 base pair region of the PTCH1 promoter to regulate its transcription.

Through analysis of their primary sequences, this binding of lncHDAC2 to the PTCH1 promoter did not rely on sequence complementary.

Since lncHDAC2 harbors several stem-loop structures, lncHDAC2 may form tertiary topological structures that may mediate the binding of lncHDAC2 to the PTCH1 promoter.

Another reason could be that lncHDAC2-interacting proteins mediate the binding of lncHDAC2 to the PTCH1 promoter.

How lncHDAC2 binds to PTCH1 promoter needs to be investigated further.

It contains 2 core subunits, CHD3 and CHD4 ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling catalases, and HDAC1 with HDAC2 mediating histone or protein deacetylation.46

The NuRD complex has been reported to play a critical role in transcriptional repression.

Like other chromatin remodelers such as SWI/SNF and Polycomb complexes, the NuRD complex has been implicated in the transcriptional regulation involved in oncogenesis and cancer progression.47,48

For instance, a truncated mutation of HDAC2 has been documented in sporadic carcinomas with microsatellite instability.49

We previously showed that Sox2 recruits the NuRD complex to inhibit mTOR transcription, leading to cellular reprogramming.46

Here we demonstrated that lncHDAC2 interacts with HDAC2 that recruits the NuRD complex to repress PTCH1 expression.

The suppression of PTCH1 expression promotes Smo activity, initiating Hh signaling, which is involved in the self-renewal of liver CSCs.

PARAGRAPH

Hh signaling is essential for various processes during organ development and maintenance of organ functions.50

The ability of the Hh pathway to modulate cell differentiation and renewal also means that deregulation of this pathway may result in uncontrolled cell fate.51

Misregulation of Hh signaling has been reported to cause formation of basal-cell medulloblastoma and myeloid leukemia.52

We previously showed that Hh signaling is required for the self-renewal of bladder cancer CSCs and that the Smo inhibitor cyclopamine abrogates bladder tumorigenesis.16

Of note, we showed that lncHDAC2-mediated Hh signaling drives the stemness of liver CSCs and cyclopamine can impair the self-renewal of liver CSCs and suppress tumor propagation as well.

Therefore, our findings suggest that downregulating lncHDAC2 will provide a potent antitumor strategy against HCC.
