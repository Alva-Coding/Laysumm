TITLE

Interferon-γ-dependent immune responses contribute to the pathogenesis of sclerosing cholangitis in mice

PARAGRAPH

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by biliary inflammation and fibrosis, whose current medical treatment is hardly effective.

We observed an increased interferon (IFN)-γ response in patients with PSC and in a mouse model of sclerosing cholangitis.

IFNγ changed the phenotype of hepatic CD8+ T lymphocytes and NK cells towards increased cytotoxicity, and its absence decreased liver cell death, reduced frequencies of inflammatory macrophages in the liver and attenuated liver fibrosis.

Therefore, IFNγ-dependent immune responses may disclose checkpoints for future therapeutic intervention strategies in sclerosing cholangitis.
