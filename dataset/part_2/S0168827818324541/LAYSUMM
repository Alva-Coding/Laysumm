TITLE

Impact of direct-acting antivirals on early recurrence of HCV-related HCC: Comparison with interferon-based therapy

PARAGRAPH

We detected no significant difference in early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence rates and patterns between patients who received interferon-based and direct-acting antiviral therapy after HCC treatment.

High lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of alpha-fetoprotein level, short recurrence-free period, and a history of multiple HCC treatments were independent risk factors for early HCC recurrence after the initiation of antiviral therapy.
