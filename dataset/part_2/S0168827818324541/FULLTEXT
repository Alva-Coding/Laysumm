TITLE

Impact of direct-acting antivirals on early recurrence of HCV-related HCC: Comparison with interferon-based therapy

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and a leading cause of cancer-related death.1

HCC usually develops in patients with chronic liver diseases, often related to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.2,3

Although interferon (IFN)-based therapy after HCC treatment reportedly reduces the risk of HCC recurrence,4–6 few patients were eligible for IFN therapy after HCC treatment because of aging or advanced liver fibrosis, and its antiviral effect was inversely associated with the rates of adverse effects.7

Currently, with the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), patients with a history of HCC can achieve a high sustained virologic response (SVR) rate with favorable tolerability.8,9

PARAGRAPH

However, a high rate of early tumor recurrence has been reported in patients with a prior history of HCC treatment who were starting DAA treatment,10,11 for which we have presented counterevidence.12

Briefly, a retrospective study compared the HCC recurrence rates between patients with a prior history of HCC treatment who underwent DAA therapy, IFN-based therapy, and non-antiviral therapy.

DAA use did not increase the early HCC recurrence rate compared with that in the other 2 groups.

In that study, the interval between initial HCC treatment and initiation of antiviral therapy was limited to 2 years, and patients with HCC recurrence before antiviral therapy were excluded.

Thus, selected patients among those we saw in daily clinical practice were enrolled.

PARAGRAPH

In the current study, we expanded the enrollment criteria to those with a history of multiple HCC treatments, irrespective of the interval between HCC treatment and initiation of antiviral therapy to reflect actual antiviral use.

We evaluated the HCC recurrence rates and patterns after the administration of IFN-based and DAA therapy.

Materials and methods

SECTION

Study design and participants

PARAGRAPH

This retrospective cohort study was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines for epidemiological research of the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare.

The study design was included in a comprehensive protocol of retrospective studies at the University of Tokyo Hospital, Department of Gastroenterology, which was approved by the University of Tokyo Medical Research Center Ethics Committee (approval number 2058).

PARAGRAPH

From 1990 to 2016, a total of 4,163 patients with treatment-naïve or recurrent HCC were admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology at the University of Tokyo Hospital.

All patients were registered in a prospectively collected computerized database, and the study was based on data until the end of August 2017.

All HCC treatment histories were stored in the database.

Among the 4,163 patients, 2,559 were treated for HCC with radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

We aimed to provide curative treatment in 2,435 of these patients and RFA treatment was successful in 2,420 patients (99.3%).

We confirmed complete response based upon the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST)13 by enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before the initiation of DAA therapy.

Of these patients, 1,691 were positive for HCV antibody and negative for hepatitis B surface antigen.

Among them, 303 patients received antiviral therapy after HCC treatments.

These patients were divided into 2 groups according to the initial antiviral therapy after HCC treatment: the IFN group (156 patients) and the DAA group (147 patients) (Fig. 1).

Patients who were treated with DAAs after failure of IFN therapy were included in the IFN group.

SECTION

Diagnosis of HCC and follow-up

PARAGRAPH

HCC was diagnosed by dynamic CT or MRI; hyperattenuation in the arterial phase and washout in the late phase were considered diagnostic.14

Dynamic CT or MRI was performed before the initiation of antiviral therapies to confirm the absence of viable HCC nodules.

We monitored HCC recurrence by dynamic CT or MRI every 4 months and measurement of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP-L3), and des-gamma-carboxy-prothrombin (DCP) levels.

HCC recurrence was diagnosed using the same criteria as applied to the diagnosis of HCC.

Liver biochemistry tests were also performed every 4 months to evaluate liver function.

SECTION

Antiviral therapy

PARAGRAPH

The IFN therapy regimens were as follows: IFN monotherapy for 24–48 weeks for genotypes 1 and 2, IFN plus ribavirin (RBV) for 48–72 weeks for genotype 1 and 24 weeks for genotype 2, peginterferon (PegIFN) monotherapy for 24–48 weeks for genotypes 1 and 2, PegIFN plus RBV for 48–72 weeks for genotype 1 and 24 weeks for genotype 2, and PegIFN plus RBV plus telaprevir or simeprevir for 12 weeks followed by 12 weeks of PegIFN plus RBV for genotype 1.

The DAA therapy regimens were as follows: daclatasvir plus asunaprevir for 24 weeks for genotype 1, sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir for 12 weeks for genotype 1, sofosbuvir plus RBV for 12 weeks for genotype 2, ombitasvir and paritaprevir with ritonavir for 12 weeks for genotype 1, and elbasvir plus grazoprevir for 12 weeks for genotype 1.

An SVR12 was defined as undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks after the cessation of antiviral therapy.

SECTION

Outcomes

PARAGRAPH

The primary endpoint was HCC recurrence after the initiation of antiviral therapy.

Time to recurrence was defined as the interval between the initiation of antiviral therapy and the detection of HCC recurrence.

The secondary endpoint was the HCC recurrence pattern.

HCC recurrences were classified into the following 4 groups in reference to the Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system: intrahepatic recurrence of a single tumor and <2 cm in diameter (stage 0), intrahepatic recurrence of a single tumor and ≥2 cm in diameter, or up to 3 tumors and 3 cm in diameter (stage A), intrahepatic recurrence of more than 3 tumors or 2–3 tumors >3 cm in diameter (multinodular) (stage B), and extrahepatic metastasis or macrovascular invasion (stage C).

Any patient with intrahepatic recurrence overlapping with extrahepatic metastasis or macrovascular invasion was included in stage C.

In addition, the rates of hepatic decompensation at 48 weeks after the initiation of antiviral therapy were evaluated.

Hepatic decompensation was defined as the occurrence of gastroesophageal varices hemorrhage, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, jaundice (total bilirubin ≥3 mg/dl) or an increase in Child-Pugh score by 2 or more points from baseline.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Data are presented as medians and interquartile ranges for quantitative variables and numbers and percentages for qualitative variables.

Differences between the IFN and DAA groups were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous variables and the chi-squared test for categorical variables.

PARAGRAPH

Recurrence rates from the initiation of antiviral therapy were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test.

Data were censored on August 31, 2017.

Patients who were lost to follow-up or died without HCC recurrence were censored.

We analyzed age, gender, total bilirubin, serum albumin, ALT, platelet count, AFP, AFP-L3, DCP, presence or absence of cirrhosis, tumor number, and size at the last HCC treatment, number of HCC treatments, interval between the last HCC treatment and initiation of antiviral therapy, achievement of an SVR, and antiviral regimen as risk factors for HCC recurrence by univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses.

The association of antiviral type with HCC recurrence was analyzed using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models adjusted for variables with a p <0.10 in the univariate analyses.

When multiple collinearity existed between variables with a p < 0.10 in the univariate analyses, only 1 variable was included in the multivariate analyses.

In addition, a matching analysis was performed to compare HCC recurrence rates because the baseline characteristics differed between the 2 groups.

Patients were extracted to match age, gender, platelet count, and the number of HCC treatments.

The chi-squared test was used to compare the HCC recurrence patterns of the 2 groups.

All tests for differences were two-tailed, and p values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate a significant difference.

Statistical analyses were performed using R 2.13.0 (http://www.R-project.org).

Results

SECTION

Patient profiles

PARAGRAPH

Baseline characteristics at the initiation of antiviral therapy are shown (Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

Patients in the DAA group were significantly older than those in the IFN group (74.4 vs. 65.3 years, p <0.001).

The proportion of females was higher in the DAA group (41 vs. 25%, p = 0.005).

The proportion of cirrhotic patients was similar in the 2 groups (76% in the IFN group vs. 74% in the DAA group, p = 0.69).

Patients in the DAA group had lower ALT levels, lower platelet counts, and higher AFP-L3 levels than those in the IFN group.

Patients in the DAA group had smaller tumors and a higher proportion of single tumors at the last HCC treatment.

The proportion of patients with a history of multiple HCC treatment was higher in the DAA group.

Among the enrolled patients, 57 (37%) and 135 (92%) achieved an SVR12 in the IFN and DAA groups, respectively.

SECTION

Recurrence according to antiviral agent

PARAGRAPH

During the median observation period of 7.2 years in the IFN group and 1.8 years in the DAA group, HCC recurrence developed in 136 patients in the IFN group and 80 patients in the DAA group.

The tumor recurrence rates at 1 and 2 years were 39% and 61% in the IFN group and 39% and 60% in the DAA group, respectively (Fig. 2A).

There was no significant difference in HCC recurrence rates between the 2 groups (p = 0.43 by log-rank test).

A matching analysis was performed with the following baseline variables: age, gender, platelet count, and the number of HCC treatments.

Sixty-one patients were extracted in each group and there was no significant difference between the matched groups (p = 0.68 by log-rank test) (Fig. 2B).

SECTION

Risk factors for recurrence in the DAA group and in the entire cohort

PARAGRAPH

In univariate analyses of patients in the DAA group, the following factors were associated with HCC recurrence (p <0.10): higher total bilirubin level, lower albumin level, higher AFP-L3 level, higher DCP level, larger number of HCC treatments, and short interval between last HCC treatment and initiation of antiviral therapy.

A multivariate analysis, adjusted for factors with a p <0.10 in univariate analyses, identified larger number of HCC treatments, and shorter interval between the last HCC treatment and initiation of antiviral therapy as independent risk factors for HCC recurrence after DAA therapy (Table 2).

In univariate analyses of the entire cohort, the following factors were associated with HCC recurrence (p <0.10): lower albumin level, higher AFP level, higher AFP-L3 level, higher DCP level, presence of liver cirrhosis, larger number of tumors at the last HCC treatment, larger number of HCC treatments, shorter interval between last HCC treatment and initiation of antiviral therapy, and achievement of an SVR.

A multivariate analysis adjusted for factors with a p < 0.10 in univariate analyses, excluding AFP level because of multiple collinearity with AFP-L3 level, showed no significant difference between the IFN and DAA groups (p = 0.71), and identified a higher AFP-L3 level, larger number of HCC treatments, and shorter interval between the last HCC treatment and initiation of antiviral therapy as independent risk factors for HCC recurrence (Table 2).

SECTION

Recurrence pattern

PARAGRAPH

Recurrence patterns are shown (Table 3).

There was no significant difference in recurrence pattern between the 2 groups (p = 0.70 by chi-squared test).

Intrahepatic recurrence with a single tumor or up to 3 tumors and tumors of <3 cm diameter (stage 0 and A) was found in most patients in both groups (116 patients [85%] in the IFN group and 67 patients [84%] in the DAA group).

Extrahepatic metastases were found in 1 patient (para-aortic and hilar lymph nodes metastasis) in the IFN group and 2 patients (bile duct invasion in 1 patient and portal vein tumor thrombosis and multiple lung metastasis in the other) in the DAA group.

No patient exhibited extrahepatic metastases overlapping with intrahepatic recurrence.

With regard to tumor markers, the AFP and ΔAFP values were not different between the 2 groups.

The AFP-L3 value at the diagnosis of HCC recurrence was higher in the DAA group and the ΔAFP-L3 value was not different between the 2 groups.

The DCP and ΔDCP values were higher in the IFN group.

Among those with cirrhosis, the 1- and 2-year tumor recurrence rates were 41% and 65% in the IFN group and 40% and 60% in the DAA group, respectively.

There was no significant difference in HCC recurrence rates between the 2 groups (p = 0.22 by log-rank test).

Amont those without cirrhosis, the 1- and 2-year tumor recurrence rates were 35% and 49% in the IFN group and 37% and 60% in the DAA group, respectively (Fig. 3C).

There was no significant difference in HCC recurrence rates between the 2 groups (p = 0.62 by log-rank test).

SECTION

Hepatic decompensation

PARAGRAPH

The rates of hepatic decompensation at 48 weeks after the initiation of antiviral therapy were 0% in the IFN group with an SVR and 7.3% in the IFN group without an SVR, and 0% in the DAA group with an SVR and 8.3% in the DAA group without an SVR (Fig. 4).

None of the patients who achieved an SVR in either group had hepatic decompensation at 48 weeks.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Previous studies have reported conflicting results on the early HCC recurrence rate after the initiation of DAA therapy.8–12,15–22

We referred to a previous summary table written by Kushner et al.23 and created Table 4 based on the recent reports.

These conflicting results occurred in part because of differences in tumor stage, HCC treatment modalities, interval between HCC treatment and DAA initiation, and indirect comparison of the DAA and control groups.

Furthermore, to compare HCC recurrence rates between 2 groups, it was considered necessary to adjust for tumor number, tumor size, and tumor marker levels, which are associated with HCC recurrence.5,24

PARAGRAPH

In this study, there was no significant difference in the early HCC recurrence rate after adjustment for tumor factors (Table 2).

A high AFP-L3 level, a history of multiple HCC treatments, and short recurrence-free period were independent risk factors for early HCC recurrence after the initiation of antiviral therapy.

This is clinically plausible for the following reasons.

First, an increase in the level of AFP-L3, a fucosylated variant of AFP that reacts with lens culinaris agglutinin A, is highly specific to HCC.25,26

High AFP-L3 levels after HCC treatment strongly indicate residual cancer that cannot be detected by imaging.24

Second, recurrent HCC has an increased risk of subsequent recurrence after curative treatment,27 which could explain the high risk of HCC recurrence in patients with a history of multiple HCC treatments.

In Table 4, recurrence rates in the current study seemed higher than those in other studies, probably because the majority of patients underwent multiple treatments for tumor recurrence before the initiation of DAA treatments.

PARAGRAPH

Third, early HCC recurrence was considered to be associated with tumor dissemination.5

Patients with a short recurrence-free period before the initiation of antiviral therapy were in the possible state of early recurrence, which is associated with a higher risk of HCC recurrence than a long recurrence-free period.

PARAGRAPH

It was hypothesized that the rapid control of inflammation could impact anti-tumoral immune control, allowing the emergence of tumor clones; IFN does not result in this emergence because of its anti-tumoral immune effect.11

The SVR rate was 91% with DAA therapy and 37% with IFN-based therapy.

However, achievement of an SVR was not significantly associated with the risk of early HCC recurrence in a multivariate analysis (Table 2).

A subgroup analysis of patients who achieved an SVR showed no significant difference in the early HCC recurrence rate between the IFN and DAA groups (Fig. 3A).

These results suggest that early HCC recurrence was not associated with viral state or the antiviral regimen.

Furthermore, a subgroup analysis of patients with a history of multiple HCC treatments showed no significant difference in early HCC recurrence rate between the 2 groups (Fig. 3B).

If the hypothesis were true, HCC recurrence may occur in patients with a history of multiple HCC treatments, who are at high risk of HCC recurrence,27 due to the introduction of DAA therapy.

However, our data do not support this hypothesis.

PARAGRAPH

This study has several limitations.

First, there was no control arm (i.e., patients who did not receive antiviral therapy after HCC treatment).

We are unable to state that antiviral therapy, regardless of regimen, reduced HCC recurrence.

However, in a recently published meta-analysis,28 the 1- and 2-year recurrence rates were 20% (95% CI 12.7–27.4%) and 47 % (95% CI 39.5–54.4), respectively, in an HCV-untreated arm after curative treatment of HCV-related HCC.

PARAGRAPH

In our study, among patients with history of 1 HCC treatment, considering the median interval between HCC treatment and the initiation of antiviral therapy of 0.6 years in the IFN group and 0.8 years in the DAA group, the 14% and 48% 0.4- and 1.4-year recurrence rates in the IFN group and 0% and 26% 0.2- and 1.2-year recurrence rates in the DAA group were not high compared with the 1- and 2-year recurrence rate in HCV-untreated arm (data not shown).

Regarding patients with a history of multiple HCC treatments, establishing an appropriate control group for patients undergoing antiviral therapy after multiple treatments for HCC would be problematic.

Second, the observational period of the DAA group was relatively short.

Therefore, long-term follow-up studies are required to investigate late recurrences of HCC and the effect on prognosis.

However, none of the patients who achieved an SVR had hepatic decompensation at 48 weeks after the initiation of antiviral therapy.

Eradication of HCV after curative HCC treatments could preserve liver function, which might improve overall survival.29

Third, the baseline characteristics of the IFN group and the DAA group were different.

However, in the multivariate analysis and the matched-control analysis there was no significant difference in the early HCC recurrence rate between the IFN group and the DAA group.

Although tumor markers were not successfully matched, being higher in the DAA group, there was no significant difference between the matched groups.

That is, it could be said that DAAs did not promote HCC recurrence compared to IFN in the matched analysis.

Fourth, patients treated with DAAs after failure of IFN therapy were included in the IFN group, which could have caused a bias.

However, the number of those patients was small (n = 7) and there was no significant difference between patients treated with DAAs after failure of IFN therapy and those treated with only IFN (data not shown).

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, we found no significant difference in the early HCC recurrence rate and pattern between patients who received IFN-based and DAA therapy after HCC treatment.

Recurrence at an advanced stage was infrequent in both groups.

A high AFP-L3 level, short recurrence-free period, and history of multiple HCC treatments were independent risk factors for early HCC recurrence after the initiation of antiviral therapy.
