TITLE

Liver transplantation using hepatitis B core positive grafts with antiviral monotherapy prophylaxis

PARAGRAPH

The risk of de novo hepatitis B infection after liver transplantation was rare when using hepatitis B core positive liver grafts with entecavir monotherapy prophylaxis.

Hepatitis B core antibody status did not impact on perioperative and long-term outcomes after liver transplantation.

This provides support for the clinical use of hepatitis B core positive liver grafts when required.
