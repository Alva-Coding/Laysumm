TITLE

Liver transplantation using hepatitis B core positive grafts with antiviral monotherapy prophylaxis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Liver transplantation (LT) has become the standard of care for patients with end-stage liver disease and early non-resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

The growth in demand for LT has not been paralleled by a similar increase in organ supply.1

Efforts have been made to promote organ donation, to develop surgical innovations such as living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), and to promote the use of extended criteria donor (ECD) organs.1

PARAGRAPH

The use of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative donors with positive antibody against hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) is an example of ECD graft.2

There is potential for anti-HBc positive donors to harbor occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, defined as the presence of liver and/or serum HBV DNA without serological evidence of chronic infection (HBsAg negative).

Hence, there is a risk of transmitting HBV infection when these grafts are transplanted to HBsAg negative recipients (de novo HBV infection).3,4

Nonetheless, anti-HBc positive donors represent an important source of organs in HBV endemic areas, including countries in the Asia-Pacific and Mediterranean region.

The prevalence of anti-HBc positivity varies worldwide, and is related to the population prevalence of HBV infection.5,6

In addition, HBV genotype strains vary in different geographic regions, with genotype B/C being the predominate strains in southeast Asia and China while genotype A/D is more commonly found in Europe.7

As a result, studies have shown conflicting outcomes regarding the use of anti-HBc positive grafts, with inferior survival reported in some studies, and varying risk of de novo HBV infection ranging from <10% to 25%.6,8–11

Prophylaxis against de novo HBV infection also varies among transplant centers worldwide, with different types of nucleos(t)ide analogue being used, with/without hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG).3,10–12

In this study, we analyzed the long-term outcomes of a large cohort of patients receiving anti-HBc positive grafts using nucleos(t)ide analogue monotherapy as prophylaxis, and evaluated the risk and outcomes of de novo HBV infection.

SECTION

Patients and methods

PARAGRAPH

This was a retrospective analysis of a prospective collected database, from Queen Mary Hospital, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.

The study protocol was approved by Institutional Review Board (Ref: UW18-358) and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki.

All adult patients who underwent LT from January 2000 to December 2015 were included.

None of the donors were positive for HBsAg or antibody to hepatitis C virus.

All deceased donors were brain death donors.

No donor organs were obtained from executed prisoners or other institutionalized persons.

All living donations were voluntary and all donors underwent evaluation by transplant surgeons, hepatologists, clinical psychologists, and nurse specialists.

HBV serology including HBsAg, anti-HBc and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) were checked for all donors.

Pre-transplant blood samples from all anti-HBc positive donors were retrieved from tissue bank to test for circulating HBV DNA.

Prioritization of deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) and graft allocation were based on the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, irrespective of the anti-HBc status of donors and recipients.

SECTION

Surgery and graft biopsy

PARAGRAPH

LT was performed under standard techniques as described previously.13

Post perfusion graft biopsy was performed routinely in all patients.

A core of liver tissue was taken using 14-gauge trucut biopsy needle and was fixed in 10% formalin and processed with hematoxylin and eosin stained sections.

All liver biopsies were read by specialist pathologists and the degree of macrovesicular steatosis and fibrosis was reported.14

SECTION

Immunosuppression protocol

PARAGRAPH

The immunosuppression regimen was standardized.

All recipients received induction therapy with basiliximab.

The maintenance regimen consisted of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) and mycophenolate mofetil.

The latter would be discontinued 3 months after LT. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors were available from 2006 as CNI sparing agents.

The majority of patients were maintained on tacrolimus monotherapy.

Maintenance steroid was only prescribed to patients who had autoimmune liver disease or a history of rejection or as CNI sparing agents.

SECTION

Follow-up protocol

PARAGRAPH

All patients were followed up regularly in clinic.

Standard liver and renal biochemistry, blood count, clotting profile and immunosuppressant level were monitored at every visit.

Hepatitis B serology including HBsAg, hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg), anti-HBs and HBV DNA were monitored at 3 monthly intervals.

SECTION

HBV prophylaxis

PARAGRAPH

Nucleos(t)ide analogue monotherapy was used as HBV prophylaxis after LT for HBV recipients.

Before 2007, lamivudine was used for all patients, with subsequent switch to entecavir thereafter.

For patients with evidence of lamivudine resistance, a combination of nucleoside and nucleotide analogue was used.

No HBIG was used before, during or after LT. In non-HBV-related recipients who had anti-HBc positive grafts, nucleoside analogue monotherapy was given, i.e. lamivudine prior to 2011, and entecavir thereafter.

De novo HBV infection was defined as HBsAg seropositivity and/or detectable HBV DNA in a non-HBV recipient.

HBV DNA was measured using COBAS Taqman assay (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ) with a lower limit of quantitation of 10 IU/ml.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Continuous parameters were presented as median with range.

Comparison between groups was performed using chi-squared test for categorical variables, or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables.

Patient survival was measured from the time of transplantation to death from any cause.

Graft loss was defined as recipient death, listing for re-transplantation or re-transplantation.

Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using log-rank test.

Cox regression analysis was used to defined variables that predicted patient and graft survival.

Univariate analysis was performed using demographics data, graft size, operative details and postoperative events; significant factors from univariate analysis (p <0.1) were entered for multivariate analysis.

Statistical significance was defined as p <0.05 and all tests were performed 2-tailed.

All calculations were done using SPSS version 22.0.

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

A total of 964 adult LTs were performed during the study period, which included 416 (43.2%) anti-HBc positive and 548 (56.8%) anti-HBc negative donors.

The median follow-up time for the cohort was 7.8 (0–18) years; it was 8.1 (0–18) years for the anti-HBc positive group and 7.3 (0–17.9) years for the anti-HBc negative group.

PARAGRAPH

Among the non-HBV recipients, 125/305 (41%) patients had detectable anti-HBs before transplant and 82 (26.9%) remained anti-HBs positive.

In HBV recipients, a minority of them (95/659 [14.4%]) developed anti-HBs transiently after transplant and only 35 patients (5.3%) remained anti-HBs positive at the last follow-up.

The allocation of anti-HBc positive grafts in our cohort are illustrated (Fig. 1); 108(26%) anti-HBc positive grafts were allocated to non-HBV recipients.

Of these, 62 were transplanted to anti-HBs positive recipients and 46 were transplanted to anti-HBs negative recipients.

Thirty-eight patients had detectable anti-HBs and anti-HBc before transplant, while 24 patients were anti-HBs positive but anti-HBc negative.

Out of these 24 patients, only 5 (20.8%) received HBV vaccination.

In the remaining anti-HBs negative recipients, 22 were positive for anti-HBc while 24 were negative for both.

PARAGRAPH

The clinical details of all patients grouped by donor anti-HBc status were summarized (Table 1).

Anti-HBc positive donors were less likely to be live donors (49 vs. 60.2%, p = 0.001) and were older on average (47.5 vs. 35 years, p <0.001) but donor body mass index (BMI) and donor gender were similar.

PARAGRAPH

There was no significant difference in the cause of death for deceased donors.

There was no difference in recipient age, gender, BMI, disease etiology, transplant indication and MELD between the 2 groups.

The majority of recipients had HBV-related liver disease, but the proportion was higher in the anti-HBc positive group.

There were 534 (55.4%) LDLTs and 430 (44.6%) DDLTs in the cohort.

There was no difference in time on waitlist for LDLT (13 [0-1,701] days for anti-HBc positive vs. 11 [1-2,129] days for anti-HBc negative grafts, p = 0.602) and DDLT (117 [0-3,849] days for anti-HBc positive vs. 77.5 [0-3,668] days for anti-HBc negative grafts, p = 0.621).

Pre-transplant plasma samples of anti-HBc donors were retrieved to test for circulating HBV DNA and 158/416 (38%) donors had samples available.

Six (3.8%) donors (4 live donors and 2 deceased donors) had detectable HBV DNA but the level was <10 IU/ml.

Graft biopsies from these donors did not show any abnormal histological finding and immunohistochemistry stains for HBsAg and HBcAg were negative.

PARAGRAPH

The operative outcomes, hospital mortality, overall complication, and severe complication (defined as Clavien-Dindo grade ≥3a) were similar between the 2 groups.15

Cold ischemic time was significantly longer in the anti-HBc positive groups, likely related to a higher percentage of DDLT in the group.

On liver graft biopsy, graft steatosis >10% was comparable (10.8 vs. 12.7%, p = 0.630) and the presence of fibrosis was very low (5.8 vs. 8.9%, p = 0.163).

No patient in either group had significant fibrosis (F2 or greater).

SECTION

Patient and graft survival in relation to anti-HBc status

PARAGRAPH

There was no difference in patient survival between the 2 groups; the 1-, 5- and 10-year patient survival rates in the anti-HBc positive group were 94.2%, 87% and 79% and they were 93.5%, 84% and 79.7% for the anti-HBc negative group (p = 0.712) (Fig. 2A).

The 1-, 5- and 10-year graft survival rates were also comparable in the anti-HBc positive (93.3%, 85.3% and 76.8%) and the anti-HBc negative groups (92.5%, 82.9% and 78.4%, p = 0.944) (Fig. 2B).

PARAGRAPH

There were 212 graft losses at the time of analysis; a total of 93/416 (22.4%) graft losses in the anti-HBc positive group and 119/548 (21.7%) graft losses in the anti-HBc negative group.

The majority of graft losses were due to HCC recurrence or co-morbidities (such as infection or cardiovascular events).

There was no graft loss due to de novo HBV infection (Table 2).

SECTION

Risk and outcomes of de novo hepatitis B infection and de novo hepatocellular carcinoma

PARAGRAPH

The overall incidence of de novo HBV infection was 3/108 (2.8%), with all instances occurring in the lamivudine era.

Sixty-four patients were on lamivudine prophylaxis and 3/64(4.7%) developed de novo HBV infection.

Forty-four patients were given entecavir as prophylaxis and none developed de novo HBV, but it was not statistically significant (p = 0.269).

The risk of de novo HBV was similar irrespective of recipient anti-HBs status.

There was 1 de novo HBV infection out of 62 (1.6%) anti-HBs positive recipients (with pre-transplant anti-HBs at 187 IU/ml), while the risk of de novo HBV infection was 2/46 (4.3%) in anti-HBs negative recipients (p = 0.792) (Fig. 1).

PARAGRAPH

The characteristics of patients who developed de novo HBV infection are illustrated (Table 3).

All 3 patients were found to be HBsAg-positive on routine monitoring without evidence of graft dysfunction at the time.

Two patients had positive HBsAg transiently and subsequent HBsAg seroclearance again with the development of anti-HBs which was maintained until the time of last follow-up.

The third patient was found to be HBsAg seropositive 1 month after transplant and serial HBV DNA every 3 months remained negative.

She developed graft dysfunction 2 years after transplant and 3 liver graft biopsies that showed evidence of non-specific hepatitis; immunohistochemical stains were negative for HBsAg and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg).

Her HBV DNA, hepatitis C virus (HCV)/hepatitis E virus (HEV) RNA and autoimmune markers were also negative.

She subsequently developed graft cirrhosis and de novo HCC 9 years afterwards and underwent re-transplantation.

Among the 3 patients with de novo HBV, 2 were anti-HBs negative before transplant and 1 was anti-HBs positive with a titer of 187 IU/ml.

No patient developed de novo HBV infection from 2011 onwards with the use of entecavir as prophylaxis.

PARAGRAPH

Among the 416 patients who were transplanted with anti-HBc positive grafts, there was 1 de novo HCC.

The clinical details of the patient were described previously.

There was neither virological nor histological evidence that de novo HBV infection was the cause of the graft cirrhosis and HCC, and the latter was most likely due to cirrhosis.

SECTION

Risk of hepatitis B recurrence in HBsAg-positive recipients

PARAGRAPH

In our cohort, there were 659 patients with HBV infection, of whom 308 (46.7%) received anti-HBc positive grafts and 351 (53.3%) anti-HBc negative grafts.

In the former group, pre-transplant HBV DNA was positive in 173/308 (56.2%) recipients with a median level of 3 × 105 (211.7–5.5 × 109) IU/ml.

All recipients received antiviral treatment before transplant.

PARAGRAPH

HBsAg positivity after LT can occur as a reappearance of HBsAg after initial seroclearance or persistent HBsAg positivity without HBsAg seroclearance.

There were 73 patients with persistent HBsAg positivity after LT without HBsAg seroclearance and 86 patients with reappearance of HBsAg after initial seroclearance.

Of these, 9/159 (5.7%) were HBeAg positive.

Although the proportion of HCC in the HBsAg-positive group was similar to that in the HBsAg-negative group (54/159 [34%] vs. 182/500 [36.4%], p = 0.577), HBsAg-positive patients experienced significantly more HCC recurrence (25/54 [46.3%] vs. 15/182 [8.2%], p <0.001] and the risk of death from HCC was also significantly higher (30/54 [55.6%] vs. 24/182 [13.2%], p <0.001).

PARAGRAPH

The 1-, 5- and 10-year cumulative HBsAg positivity rates, after initial seroclearance, for patients who had anti-HBc positive donors were 5.1%, 12.6% and 15.4%.

Among patients who had anti-HBc negative donors, the 1-, 5- and 10-year cumulative HBsAg positivity rate was 6.9%, 13.7% and 16.5% (p = 0.868).

(Fig. 3A) The 1-, 5- and 10-year cumulative rate of virological rebound (defined as detectable HBV DNA) was 3.7% vs. 4.5%, 8.0% vs. 10.3% and 10.7% vs. 12.6% in anti-HBc positive group and anti-HBc negative group, respectively (p = 0.419) (Fig. 3B).

SECTION

Outcomes between donor anti-HBc and hepatocellular carcinoma

PARAGRAPH

Out of 659 HBsAg-positive patients, 290 (44%) had concomitant HCC.

Approximately half received anti-HBc positive grafts (130/290 [44.8%]) and 160/290 (55.2%) received anti-HBc negative grafts, respectively (p = 0.660).

The 1-, 5- and 10-year patient survival rates in HCC recipients who were transplanted with anti-HBc positive grafts were 96.2%, 83.9% and 73.5%, compared with 95.6%, 75.8% and 70.4% for those with anti-HBc negative grafts (p = 0.271) (Fig. S1A).

The risk of HCC recurrence was also the same irrespective of donor anti-HBc status.

The 1-, 5- and 10-year disease-free survival rates of patients with HCC were 90.8%, 80.8% and 71.3% in the anti-HBc positive group and 88.1%, 74.7% and 69.7% in the anti-HBc negative group (p = 0.395) (Fig. S1B).

SECTION

Outcomes of anti-HBc positive grafts in living donor vs. deceased donor liver transplantation

PARAGRAPH

Use of anti-HBc positive grafts showed comparable outcomes in LDLT vs. DDLT.

Patient and graft survival up to 10 years were similar between anti-HBc positive and anti-HBc negative groups, for both LDLT and DDLT (Fig. S2A,B).

SECTION

Outcomes of anti-HBc grafts by MELD score

PARAGRAPH

Seventy-two high MELD patients (defined as MELD ≥35) were allocated with anti-HBc positive grafts and 99 high MELD patients had anti-HBc negative grafts.

The 1-, 5- and 10-year graft survival rates were 94.4 vs. 88.9%, 87.2 vs. 82.8% and 78.7 vs. 81.6% in the anti-HBc positive and anti-HBc negative groups, respectively (p = 0.468).

The 1-, 5- and 10-year patient survival rates were 94.2%, 86.7% and 77.8% in anti-HBc positive donors and 90.7%, 85.5% and 84.3% in anti-HBc negative donors, respectively (p = 0.248) (Fig. 4).

Comparable outcomes were also seen among patients with MELD <35 (Fig. S3).

SECTION

Predictors of patient and graft survival at multivariate analysis

PARAGRAPH

Anti-HBc positive graft was not a significant factor associated with survival.

In multivariate analysis, the following variables were associated with poorer patient survival: male recipient (hazard ratio [HR]; 95% CI 1.04–2.11; p = 0.03), HCC (HR = 1.64; 95% CI 1.22–2.21; p = 0.001), prolonged cold ischemic time (HR = 1.002; 95% CI 1.001–1.003; p <0.001) and grade ≥3a complications (HR = 1.90; 95% CI 1.42–2.54; p <0.001) were associated with poorer patient survival (Table 4).

Similar factors were found in multivariate analysis for graft survival; HCC (HR = 1.55; 95% CI 1.16–2.07; p = 0.003), prolonged cold ischemic time (HR = 1.002; 95% CI 1.001–1.002; p <0.001) and grade ≥3a complications (HR = 2.08; 95% CI 1.57–2.75; p <0.001) were associated with poorer graft survival (Table 5).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Data in literature are conflicting regarding the risk of de novo HBV infection with the use of anti-HBc positive grafts and the possible inferior survival outcomes in long-term.

This explains the wide variation in clinical practice.

Almost half of the surveyed transplant physicians reported that they would not use anti-HBc positive grafts in HBV naïve recipients, and there were also different practices regarding HBV prophylaxis.3,10,16

The present study demonstrated excellent long-term survival with the use of anti-HBc positive grafts.

Graft survival at 10 years was 76.8% for the anti-HBc positive and 78.4% for the anti-HBc negative group, whereas patient survival at 10 years was almost 80% for both groups.

In our region, the population prevalence of anti-HBc positivity is up to 50% and discarding anti-HBc positive organs would not be practical.5

In the present study, we have demonstrated that the risk of primary nonfunction, delayed graft function, overall complication and hospital mortality were comparable between anti-HBc positive and negative grafts.

There was no difference in long-term survival outcomes between anti-HBc positive and negative grafts in patients who received different graft types, had high MELD scores, or had HCC.

PARAGRAPH

The overall incidence of de novo HBV infection was 2.8%.

The existence of intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in anti-HBc positive donors is likely the main reason for de novo HBV infection.

Without proper prophylaxis, the risk of de novo HBV after LT could be up to 80%.2,3

We have demonstrated the risk of de novo HBV remained very low with the use of antiviral prophylaxis.

The 3 de novo HBV infections occurred in patients who received lamivudine monotherapy.

More importantly, no de novo HBV infection occurred with the use of entecavir as antiviral prophylaxis, highlighting the importance of using an antiviral agent with a high barrier to resistance.

HBV virological analyses were routinely monitored for all patients, therefore the exact incidence of recurrent HBV and de novo HBV infection can be identified in the absence of graft dysfunction.

In the patient who developed cirrhosis, there was no evidence of HBV/HCV/HEV infection in the graft.

The exact cause of graft failure was unclear, although it was postulated that de novo autoimmune hepatitis or chronic rejection may have contributed.

PARAGRAPH

Our data provides strong evidence that the risk of de novo HBV infection is exceedingly rare using entecavir alone without HBIG in HBV naïve recipients who received anti-HBc positive organs.

Current international guideline still recommends lamivudine as first line therapy,17 however, the current study showed that all de novo HBV infection occurred in those receiving lamivudine, whereas this was not observed in those receiving entecavir.

Therefore, we recommend that agents with better resistance profiles should be adopted irrespective of recipient anti-HBs status for transplant recipients under the effect of immunosuppression.

With the availability of generic entecavir, the cost issue will be less of a concern.

The use of HBIG in the setting of occult HBV-infected graft would seem superfluous as it is primarily used for preventing graft infection.

PARAGRAPH

Out of the 3 de novo HBV infection in our study, 1 patient had a pre-transplant anti-HBs titer at 187 IU/ml.

In non-HBV patients, even in those who had acquired prior HBV immunity (i.e. detectable anti-HBs before LT), the presence of anti-HBs would not confer absolute immunity to de novo HBV infection, and the titer of anti-HBs tends to fall after LT.18,19 In addition, whether pre-/post-transplant vaccination would be effective remains unclear.20–22

In our center, there is no routine vaccination strategy.

Response to HBV vaccination was low in immunosuppressed patients, but there was evidence to show that response rate would improve when multiple prolonged courses of vaccination were administered.22,23

We have previously demonstrated that recipients who responded to HBV vaccination, and those who developed spontaneous anti-HBs after LT, would respond to further vaccination.24

At the moment, lifelong indefinite antiviral prophylaxis is still considered necessary.

Active immunization might serve as a potential therapeutic strategy that might enable cessation of antiviral therapy.

The overall de novo HBV infection rate was extremely low, suggesting that antiviral prophylaxis may possibly be stopped in selected recipients such as those who are anti-HBs positive.

The risk of reactivation arises from the presence of intrahepatic cccDNA.

However, a liver biopsy is necessary to detect intrahepatic cccDNA, which limits its applicability for regular monitoring, coupled with the lack of standardization for measuring cccDNA.

Recently, a highly sensitive method for quantitation of intrahepatic cccDNA by droplet digital PCR has been developed.

Other markers, including serum anti-HBc IgG level, were shown to correlate with intrahepatic cccDNA in patients with occult HBV infection.25

Therefore the quantitation of anti-HBc IgG, together with other novel markers such as hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcAg) or HBV RNA, might serve as a surrogate for intrahepatic cccDNA.26,27

PARAGRAPH

Meanwhile, the use of anti-HBc positive grafts in HBsAg-positive recipients is less of a concern because such recipients will require lifelong HBV prophylaxis, and there is no risk of transmitting a “new” infection.

In our study, the risk of HBsAg positivity and virological rebound was similar irrespective of anti-HBc status.

PARAGRAPH

There did not seem to be an increase risk of HCC recurrence and risk of de novo HCC in patients who were transplanted with anti-HBc positive grafts.

Overall survival and risk of HCC recurrence were similar between the 2 groups.

More importantly, we have demonstrated the risk of de novo HCC was minimal.

The cause for the de novo HCC was likely due to graft cirrhosis.

The concern that anti-HBc positive grafts might harbor occult HBV infection with increased risk of de novo HCC was not evident.

However, for those who remain HBsAg positive, there was a higher rate of HCC recurrence, leading to a poorer outcome.

PARAGRAPH

There is always concern regarding the use of ECD grafts in high MELD recipients.

The use of anti-HBc positive organs in MELD ≥35 patients did not indicate a significant difference in long-term survival, with excellent 10-year survival reported when using anti-HBc positive grafts.

The use of anti-HBc positive grafts also showed comparable results after LDLT and DDLT with 10-year survival around 80%.

PARAGRAPH

At our center, anti-HBc status was not used for donor-recipient matching.28

The need for donor-recipient matching was based on balancing benefit and risk of the individual recipient; in the setting of donor anti-HBc status, there does not seem to be a need for such matching as the outcomes of these grafts were equivalent to anti-HBc negative grafts.

However, such practice is certainly debatable, especially in areas with a low prevalence of anti-HBc positivity and HBV-infected recipients.

The low but definite risk of de novo HBV infection should be taken into consideration, and the need for lifelong prophylaxis which would otherwise not be required should also be explained.

Nonetheless, as the current study showed excellent perioperative and long-term outcomes using anti-HBc positive grafts, HBsAg naïve recipients should be given the opportunity to receive such grafts with informed consent in areas of low prevalence.

PARAGRAPH

Previous studies showed inferior graft survival with anti-HBc positive organs, but graft loss was likely caused by technical issues and not related to de novo HBV infection.10,11

It was also hypothesized that anti-HBc status might reflect suboptimal graft quality through unexplained mechanisms.10

Our study has shown the contrary.

One important point to note is that donor demographics were very different in our study.

Previous studies consisted of almost exclusively deceased donors whilst live donors constituted 534/964 (55.4%) in our cohort.

Candidates with evidence of pre-existing liver disease such as fibrosis or steatosis >10% would be ineligible for live donation, therefore live donors represent young and healthy individuals with excellent quality grafts.

For deceased donors, although selection was less stringent, contrast imaging would be performed if donor liver function was abnormal and graft biopsy would be taken at procurement if there was any concern about graft quality.

Compliance to treatment is another major factor for the excellent outcomes.

All patients received education from nurse specialists, and their drug compliance would be checked and reinforced at each clinic visit.

Antiviral agents are generally well tolerated, with minimal side effects and drug-drug interactions, therefore compliance is usually not an issue.

PARAGRAPH

HBV DNA was detected in 6/158(3.8%) anti-HBc positive donors in whom pre-transplant samples were available.

The level of viremia was extremely low.

None of their respective recipients developed de novo HBV infection.

The presence of circulating HBV DNA is likely an incidental event rather than a clinically significant finding.29

PARAGRAPH

The strength of the current study include a large cohort size, with the current study representing the largest single center experience with anti-HBc positive grafts using a standardized protocol of HBV prophylaxis, along with a long (median 7.8 years) follow-up time.

There are several limitations of the current study.

Firstly, this was a retrospective study of a single center.

Secondly, HBV prophylaxis changed from lamivudine to entecavir in 2011, therefore we were unable to evaluate the risk of lamivudine resistance.

Thirdly, this study was conducted in an area with high prevalence of anti-HBc positivity, and the importance of using such grafts may be of less concern to regions with lower seroprevalence.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, excellent outcomes with anti-HBc positive grafts for LT can be achieved with the use of oral antiviral alone, with excellent long-term survival, irrespective of recipient HBV status, graft type, MELD and without increase in HCC recurrence.
