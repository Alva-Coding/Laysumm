TITLE

Mutational landscape of a chemically-induced mouse model of liver cancer

PARAGRAPH

Mouse models are widely used to study the biology of cancer and to test potential therapies.

Herein, we have described the mutational landscape of tumours arising in a carcinogen-induced mouse model of liver cancer.

Since cancer is a disease caused by genomic alterations, information about the patterns and types of mutations in the tumours in this mouse model should facilitate its use to study human liver cancer.
