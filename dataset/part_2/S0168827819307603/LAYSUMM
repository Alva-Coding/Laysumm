TITLE

OGDHL silencing promotes hepatocellular carcinoma by reprogramming glutamine metabolism

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent tumors worldwide and is correlated with a high mortality rate.

In patients with HCC, lower expression of the enzyme OGDHL is significantly associated with worse survival.

Herein, we show that silencing of OGDHL induces lipogenesis and influences the chemosensitization effect of sorafenib in liver cancer cells by reprogramming glutamine metabolism.

OGDHL is a promising prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in OGDHL-negative liver cancer.
