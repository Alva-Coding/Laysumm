TITLE

A defect in endothelial autophagy occurs in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and promotes inflammation and fibrosis

PARAGRAPH

Autophagy is a physiological process controlling endothelial homeostasis in vascular beds outside the liver.

This study demonstrates that autophagy is defective in the liver endothelial cells of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

This defect promotes liver inflammation and fibrosis at early stages of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but also at advanced stages of chronic liver disease.
