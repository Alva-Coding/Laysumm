TITLE

Development of a prognostic score to predict response to Yttrium-90 radioembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein invasion

PARAGRAPH

Yttrium-90 transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is a microembolic procedure that minimizes alterations to hepatic arterial flow, and thus can be safely performed in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT).

In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the independent predictors of long-term outcomes in patients with HCC and PVTT treated with TARE.

Bilirubin level, extension of PVTT and tumor burden were independently related to post-treatment survival: the combination of these factors allowed us to build a prognostic stratification that may help to better identify good candidates for the treatment, and those for whom TARE may be futile.
