TITLE

SEC14L2, a lipid-binding protein, regulates HCV replication in culture with inter- and intra-genotype variations

PARAGRAPH

Until the year 2015, consistent replication of patient-derived isolates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in an in vitro model remained a limitation in HCV research.

In 2015 a group of authors identified a protein named SEC14L2 that enabled the replication of HCV isolates in cell culture.

We performed a large screen encompassing 73 isolates of 4 different HCV genotypes.

Additionally, we replaced the natural SEC14L2 with 13 different mutants to test if the protein variation significantly altered its HCV replication enhancing functions.

We showed that different genotypes of HCV react differently to the presence of this protein and the variants of the protein mimic the behavior of the wild-type.
