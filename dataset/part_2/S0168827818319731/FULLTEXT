TITLE

Dysregulation of serum bile acids and FGF19 in alcoholic hepatitis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Alcohol abuse is the most important cause of liver disease worldwide.1

The most severe form of alcoholic liver disease is alcoholic hepatitis with mortality rates of 20–40% at 1–6 months, and a 90-day mortality rate of up to 75% in severe alcoholic hepatitis.2–4

Corticosteroids are the only effective medical therapy but failure in many patients has been reported.2

There is no cure for patients not responding to medical therapy, except for early liver transplantation that is offered in some centers to a highly selected group of patients.5

PARAGRAPH

Alcoholic hepatitis is a hepatocellular disease associated with cholestasis and accumulation of bile acids in the liver and the systemic circulation.6

Accumulation of bile acids in the liver can result in hepatocellular damage followed by inflammation and fibrosis.7

Early studies using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) have identified elevated bile acid levels in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and a positive correlation with the alcoholic hepatitis score.8

The liver controls bile acid homeostasis via a complicated network of pathways regulated by nuclear receptors.7

One important regulator is fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), a hormone that is secreted in the intestine and reaches the liver via the portal circulation.

Binding of FGF19 to its receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 and β-Klotho, activates mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, resulting in the downregulation of the rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid synthesis, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 (CYP7A1), gene expression and inhibition of bile acid synthesis.9

Although FGF19 is not detectable in the liver under normal conditions, previous studies suggest that FGF19 is expressed under cholestatic conditions, such as in patients with primary biliary cholangitis.

Plasma/serum elevated FGF19 levels are elevated in patients with various hepatic disorders including non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic primary biliary cholangitis and in patients with extrahepatic cholestasis.9–11

FGF19 mRNA expression was increased in the terminal ileum of actively drinking patients with cirrhosis when compared with patients with cirrhosis of non-alcoholic etiology.12

PARAGRAPH

In this study, we first determined serum bile acid levels and bile acid composition in patients with alcoholic hepatitis using mass spectrometry.

We further investigated the relationship between bile acids, FGF19 and histopathological parameters and clinical outcomes in the setting of alcoholic hepatitis.

The results of this study can help to understand the pathophysiology of alcoholic hepatitis as well as to evaluate the role of recombinant FGF19 preparations used in treatment.

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Patient cohorts

PARAGRAPH

A total of 132 patients with alcoholic hepatitis, nine patients with alcohol use disorder, and nine non-alcoholic control patients were enrolled from the InTeam Consortium from the 12 participating centers.

Inclusion criteria were: i) age >18 years and ≤70 years, ii) active alcohol abuse (>50 g/day for men and >40 g/day for women) in the last three months, iii) aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin >3 mg/dl in the past three months, iv) liver biopsy and/or clinical picture consistent with alcoholic hepatitis.

Exclusion criteria were: i) autoimmune liver disease (anti-nuclear antibody >1/320), ii) chronic viral hepatitis, iii) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), iv) complete portal vein thrombosis, v) extrahepatic terminal disease, vi) pregnancy, and vii) lack of signed informed consent.

The mortality was evaluated at 30 days.

For the three patients who underwent liver transplantation, the transplantation date was considered as date of death.

The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of each participating center and patients were enrolled after written informed consent was obtained from each patient.

FGF19 levels, C4 levels, serum bile acid levels, other clinical laboratory parameters and clinical outcomes were measured and collected.

The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was calculated from all patients from whom bilirubin level, international normalized ratio (INR), and creatinine level were available.

SECTION

Bile acid measurements

PARAGRAPH

Serum levels of total bile acids, conjugated and unconjugated as well as specific bile acids were measured in an Agilent series 6120 quadrupole mass detector as described previously.13

In brief, serum (20 µl) was protein precipitated with 80 µl of cold acetonitrile containing deuterated cholic acid as an internal standard, vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C.

Supernatant was evaporated under vacuum and reconstituted in assay mobile phase.

Bile acid separation was achieved using an Acuity (Waters, Milford, MA) UPLC BEH C18 column (1.7 microns 2.1 × 100 mm) on a Nextera UPLC (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan); the temperatures of the column and auto sampler were 65 °C and 12 °C, respectively.

Sample injection volume was 1 µl.

The mobile phase consisted of 10% acetonitrile and 10% methanol in water containing 0.1% formic acid (Mobile Phase A) and 10% methanol in acetonitrile 0.1% formic acid (Mobile Phase B) delivered as a gradient: 0–5 min Mobile Phase B held at 22%; 5–12 min Mobile Phase B increased linearly to 60%, 12–15 min Mobile Phase B increased linearly to 80% and 15–19 min Mobile Phase B constant at 80% at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.

The mass spectrometer (Q-Trap 5500; Sciex, Framingham, MA) was operated in negative electro-spray mode working in the multiple reaction mode (MRM).

Operating parameters were: curtain gas at 30 psi; ion spray voltage at 4,500 V; temperature at 550 °C; ion source gas 1 at 60 psi; ion source gas 2 at 65 psi.

Transition MRMs, declustering potential, entrance potentials and collision cell exit potentials were optimized using the Analyst® software (Sciex, Framingham, MA).

Dwell times were 0.025 s. Only bile acids with an overall contribution of >2% in healthy subjects were analyzed and depicted in figures and tables.

SECTION

Quantification of C4 levels

PARAGRAPH

7-alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada).

Cortisol-1,2-d2 was purchased from CDN Isotopes (Hornsby, NSW, Australia) and charcoal stripped serum (CSS) was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (Castle Hill, NSW, Australia).

Additional reagents and solvents were of HPLC grade.

To 10 µl of serum, 50 µl of ice cold acetonitrile containing 2% formic acid and 1.8 µg of the assay internal standard cortisol-1,2-d2, was added.

The mixture was vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min.

The supernatant was collected and evaporated under vacuum at room temperature.

The samples were then reconstituted in the assay mobile phase and transferred to a 96 well plate for analysis.

Stock solution of C4 (1 µM) was prepared in CSS and this was further diluted in CSS to give final concentrations of 0.01–1 µM.

The standards were then treated in the same way as the samples.

A Nextera UPLC (SHIMADZU, Kyoto, Japan) system was used in combination with a Q-TRAP 5500 Mass Spectrometer (AB SCIEX, Toronto, Canada) with Analyst Software 1.6.2.

Chromatographic separations were performed with an ACQUITY (WATERS, Milford, MA) UPLC BEH C18 column (1.7 µm 2.1 × 100 mm).

The temperatures of the column and auto sampler were 65 °C and 12 °C, respectively.

Sample injection was 1 µl.

The mobile phase consisted of 10% acetonitrile and 10% methanol in water containing 0.1% formic acid (Mobile Phase A) and 10% methanol in acetonitrile 0.1% formic acid (Mobile Phase B) delivered as a gradient: 0–3 min Mobile Phase B 20%; 3–3.5 min Mobile Phase B 80%, 7–9 min Mobile Phase B was a constant 80% at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.

The mass spectrometer was operated in positive electro-spray mode working in the MRM.

Transition MRMs for C4 and the internal standard cortisol-1,2-d2 were 401.2→177.2 and 365.2→122.2, respectively.

Operating parameters were: curtain gas at 30 psi; ion spray voltage at 4,500 V; temperature at 550C; ion source gas 1 at 60 psi; ion source gas 2 at 65 psi.

Declustering potential, entrance potentials and collision cell exit potentials were optimized using Analyst software.

SECTION

FGF19 ELISA

PARAGRAPH

FGF19 concentrations were measured from serum samples using an ELISA kit from Biovendor (Asheville, NC) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

SECTION

FGF19 immunohistochemistry

PARAGRAPH

Immunohistochemistry was performed on 4 µm formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded liver core biopsies.

The tissue sections were stained with an antibody to FGF19 (1:300) from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA).

Slides were stained on a Ventana Discovery Ultra (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ, USA).

Antigen retrieval was performed using CC1 for 92 min at 95 °C.

Due to the very low expression level of FGF19, immunohistochemical detection required the use of the HQ amplification system (Ventana) to detect the weakly expressing FGF19 cells within the liver and was followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as a chromagen.

Immunohistochemical staining was followed by a hematoxylin counterstain.

Slides were rinsed, dehydrated through alcohol and xylene and coverslipped.

SECTION

RNA sequencing

PARAGRAPH

High-throughput transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed using Illumina HiSeq2000 platform (San Diego, CA) with liver samples provided by the InTeam Consortium Human Biorepository Core (University of Pittsburgh, PA) as described (Manuscript in preparation; Argemi JM, Bataller R et al.).

A total of 51 patients with different phenotypes were selected: 12 patients with early alcoholic steatohepatitis, 11 patients with non-severe alcoholic hepatitis (with Maddrey discriminant function (MDF ≤32), 18 patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (MDF >32), 10 explants from patients who underwent early liver transplantation for severe alcoholic hepatitis.

Controls (n = 10) were non-diseased livers obtained from biopsied single nodules, whose histology was without significant alterations.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad PRISM (La Jolla, USA) and R statistical software.14

Comparisons between three groups or more were conducted using One-Way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test for multiple comparisons (for continuous variables) and Chi-squared tests (for categorical variables) using GraphPad PRISM.

A comparison of two groups was performed using the unpaired Student’s t test.

Univariate regression analysis was performed using R to determine associations of FGF19 and MELD with several biochemical markers and clinical outcomes.

Cox univariate regression analysis was used to determine associations of FGF19 with 30-day mortality.

Results

SECTION

Demographic and laboratory data

PARAGRAPH

A total of 33 individuals were initially assessed: Nine non-alcoholic control individuals, nine patients with alcohol use disorder and 15 untreated patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

Their demographic and laboratory data are shown (Table 1).

Patients with alcoholic hepatitis had significantly higher levels of bilirubin, AST, albumin and INR compared with alcohol dependent and control individuals.

ALT levels were significantly elevated in patients with alcoholic hepatitis relative to controls.

The mean MELD value of patients with alcoholic hepatitis was 25.

SECTION

Serum bile acid levels and bile acid composition

PARAGRAPH

To assess alterations in bile acid levels and bile acid composition, serum samples were analyzed from patients with alcoholic hepatitis at the time of inclusion, patients with alcohol use disorder and controls using mass spectrometry.

The results of the bile acid measurements are depicted (Fig. 1).

Total and conjugated bile acids were significantly elevated in alcoholic hepatitis patients compared with controls and patients with alcohol use disorder (Fig. 1A and B).

In addition, the individual taurine- and glycine-conjugates were significantly increased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis in relation to patients with alcohol use disorder and controls (Fig. 1C and D).

In contrast, there was no significant difference in the unconjugated bile acids comparing the three groups in absolute concentrations (Fig. 1E).

PARAGRAPH

Bile acid composition analysis of the different patient populations revealed significantly elevated glyco-cholic acid (G-CA), tauro-cholic acid (T-CA) and tauro-chenodeoxycholic acid (T-CDCA) in patients with alcoholic hepatitis compared to patients with alcohol dependence and controls.

In contrast, patients with alcoholic hepatitis showed significantly lower levels of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), glyco-deoxycholic acid (G-DCA) and CA as well as lower proportional contributions of total unconjugated bile acids compared with control patients and patients with alcohol use disorder (Fig. 1F).

Hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA), tauro-deoxycholic acid (T-DCA) and tauro-lithocholic acid (T-LCA) were also significantly lower in patients with alcoholic hepatitis compared with controls.

Conjugated CDCA and conjugated CA were significantly higher in alcoholic hepatitis patients when compared with controls (61.0% vs. 35.8%, and 32.8% vs. 12.6%, respectively) and conjugated CA were also significantly higher in alcoholic hepatitis patients compared with alcohol dependent patients (32.8% vs. 13.6%).

In contrast, conjugated DCA were decreased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis compared with alcohol dependent patients and controls (1.4% vs. 13.0% and 14.5%) (Fig. 1F).

SECTION

Regulation of bile acid synthesis

PARAGRAPH

To understand the regulation and metabolism of bile acids in alcoholic hepatitis, serum C4 levels and FGF19 levels were determined.

C4, a bile acid synthesis intermediate serves as a marker for de novo bile acid synthesis while FGF19 represents an important negative feedback regulator of bile acid synthesis.

PARAGRAPH

FGF19 levels were significantly elevated in patients with alcoholic hepatitis relative to patients with alcohol use disorder and controls (Fig. 2A).

In line with these results, serum C4 levels were significantly decreased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis compared with controls (Fig. 2B).

These results indicate that FGF19 regulates de novo bile acid synthesis, but total serum bile acid levels are not affected.

SECTION

Analysis of hepatic FGF19 gene expression in different patient populations as well as of hepatic genes related to bile acid uptake, synthesis and efflux

PARAGRAPH

FGF19 serum levels measured in patients with alcoholic hepatitis were markedly higher (by ∼100 fold) compared with FGF19 levels detected in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or non-alcoholic fatty liver whose serum levels were similar to controls.15

In addition, as intrahepatic cholestasis is associated with hepatic expression of FGF19 in conditions such as primary biliary cholangitis,10 we wanted to determine whether hepatic FGF19 production was also induced in alcoholic hepatitis.

Hepatic FGF19 gene expression was hence quantitated in multiple patient groups with different liver pathologies.

The mRNA expression levels in patients with normal liver histology (control individuals), early alcoholic steatohepatitis, non-severe alcoholic hepatitis, severe alcoholic hepatitis responders and non-responders as well as explants from patients with alcoholic hepatitis are depicted (Fig. 3).

Hepatic FGF19 expression was essentially undetectable in controls and in patients with early alcoholic steatohepatitis, but its levels increased with severity of liver pathology, and significantly elevated hepatic FGF19 gene expression was detected in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (responders as well as non-responders) and in explants from alcoholic hepatitis patients compared with control subjects (Fig. 3A).

In addition, hepatic expression levels of genes involved in bile acid uptake, synthesis, and excretion were analyzed in the aforementioned patient groups.

Patients with increasing severity of liver pathology showed a lower gene expression of Na+-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP [SLC10A1]) that is involved in bile acid uptake into hepatocytes (Fig. 3B).

Worsening liver disease was also associated with a reduction of CYP7A1 expression and hence impaired bile acid synthesis (Fig. 3C), which is consistent with low serum C4 levels.

The expression of another gene involved in bile acid synthesis, cytochrome P450 family 8 subfamily B member 1 (CYP8B1), was relatively stable and independent of the degree of liver disease (Fig. 3D).

The expression of the bile salt export pump (BSEP [ABCB11]) important for bile acid excretion into bile canaliculi was significantly decreased in patients with different severity of alcoholic hepatitis when compared with control subjects (Fig. 3E).

The hepatic gene expression of transporters important for bile acid efflux from the basolateral membrane into the systemic circulation multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4 [ABCC4]) and MRP3 (ABCC3) correlated with worsening alcoholic hepatitis (Fig. 3F and G).

SECTION

Biliary epithelial cells and ductular cells express FGF19 in the liver of patients with alcoholic hepatitis

PARAGRAPH

Given few reports about hepatic FGF19 synthesis in different cells such as hepatocytes in primary biliary cholangitis10 or hepatic cancer stem cells in HCC,16 we determined the cellular source of FGF19 production, after establishing that FGF19 mRNA expression is induced in the livers of patients with alcoholic hepatitis (Fig. 3A).

Cholangiocytes in larger bile ducts and (to a lesser degree) ductular cells of smaller ductules were FGF19-positive in patients with alcoholic hepatitis (Fig. 4A and B).

A few non-parenchymal cells (most likely endothelial cells) also stained positive for FGF19 (Fig. 4C).

Gallbladder epithelial cells from a resected gall bladder served as positive staining control (Fig. 4D).

Non-neoplastic liver (adjacent to a resected HCC) with portal tracts was negative for FGF19 protein (Fig. 4E), although large caliber bile ducts are weakly positive for FGF19 (Fig. 4F).

SECTION

Specific bile acids associated with serum FGF19, MELD, and ALT levels

PARAGRAPH

As bile acid levels were much higher in patients with alcoholic hepatitis than in controls and patients with alcohol use disorder (Fig. 1), we proceeded to perform univariate regression analysis of the most abundant bile acids with MELD and serum FGF19 levels.

Our analysis showed significant positive associations between total bile acids, absolute conjugated bile acids, proportional conjugated bile acids with MELD or FGF19 levels (Tables 2 and 3).

The unconjugated bile acids CDCA, CA, DCA as well as conjugated DCA negatively correlated with MELD and FGF19 levels (Tables 2 and 3).

MELD was also significantly associated with taurine-conjugated bile acid, T-CA and conjugated CA but even more significantly with T-CDCA (Table 2 and Fig. 5A).

In addition to MELD, bilirubin values were analyzed and associated with various bile acids.

Univariate regression analysis yielded similar results to those obtained with MELD and bile acids (Table S1).

PARAGRAPH

Furthermore, the conjugated-to-unconjugated bile acid ratio, G-CA, T-CA, and conjugated CA were highly significantly correlated – all positively – with serum FGF19 (Table 3).

SECTION

Laboratory and clinical parameters associated with FGF19

PARAGRAPH

As FGF19 levels were highest in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (Fig. 2A), we next determined the role of serum FGF19 as a potential biomarker in alcoholic hepatitis, and correlated it with multiple laboratory and clinical parameters.

For this analysis, a larger cohort of patients with alcoholic hepatitis (treated and untreated at the time of inclusion) was analyzed.

Demographic, clinical and biochemical parameters of patients with alcoholic hepatitis (n = 132) are presented (Table 4).

Univariate regression analysis revealed a significant positive correlation of FGF19 with bilirubin levels and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) (Table 5).

A significant negative correlation was detected between FGF19 and the patients’ fibrosis stage as well as their level of polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) infiltration (Table 5).

PARAGRAPH

Similarly, when comparing FGF19 serum levels of patients with alcoholic hepatitis with above average bilirubin levels with those with below average bilirubin levels, significantly different FGF19 levels can be detected (Fig. 5B).

The same holds true for the comparison of FGF19 and GGT.

Significantly higher FGF19 levels are noted in patients with higher GGT than in those with lower GGT levels (Fig. 5C).

PARAGRAPH

We decided to examine a subgroup of patients with more severe alcoholic hepatitis more closely (MELD ≥29, >75th percentile) as FGF19 started to rise more markedly when the contribution of conjugated bile acids to the total bile acid content was close to 100% (Fig. 5D), indicating a more distinct increase with more severe cholestasis and alcoholic hepatitis.

Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed FGF19 correlates significantly with 30-day mortality in patients with more severe alcoholic hepatitis (Table 6).

However, the hazard ratio was fairly modest.

PARAGRAPH

However, 30-day mortality was not significantly correlated with FGF19 when all patients with alcoholic hepatitis were analyzed.

Also, Cox multivariate analysis revealed no independent prognostic value of FGF19 in combination with MELD (data not shown).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

This study investigated the relationship between bile acids, FGF19 and clinical outcomes in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

Patients with alcoholic hepatitis had significantly increased total, and absolute and proportional conjugated bile acid levels in relation to controls and patients with alcohol use disorder.

In particular, the proportional contribution of G-/T-CDCA and G-/T-CA was significantly higher and that of G-/T-DCA was significantly lower in patients with alcoholic hepatitis than in controls and patients with alcohol use disorder.

The increase in the conjugated primary bile acids G-/T-CDCA and G-/T-CA in patients with alcoholic hepatitis can in part be explained by the presence of cholestasis in alcoholic hepatitis,6 also demonstrated by increased bilirubin and GGT levels in patients with alcoholic hepatitis in our study.

Given cholestasis, significantly lower amounts of primary bile acids are secreted into the intestine.

Normally, these primary bile acids are metabolized by bacterial 7-alpha dehydroxylase to secondary bile acids (CA to DCA, and CDCA to LCA).17

However, as lower amounts of CA reach the intestine in cholestasis, less DCA will be produced by the intestinal bacteria and hence be absorbed in the ileum into the systemic circulation in form of conjugated DCA in patients with alcoholic hepatitis (Fig. 1F).

PARAGRAPH

Serum FGF19 levels were markedly increased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis by about 100 times in relation to controls.

FGF19 inhibits hepatic CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme for bile acid synthesis.18

Serum C4, a marker for de novo bile acid synthesis, was hence significantly decreased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis compared to controls.

However, total serum bile acid levels were not affected by the suppression of bile acid synthesis in these patients suggesting a prominent role of cholestasis.

As serum FGF19 levels were markedly increased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, the hepatic gene expression of FGF19 was quantitated.

Hepatic gene expression increased with increasing severity of alcoholic hepatitis.

This correlated with decreasing CYP7A1 in more severe forms of alcoholic hepatitis.

Interestingly, CYP8B1 was not affected by the degree of liver disease.

As seen in obstructive cholestasis,19 bile acid uptake (NTCP) and bile acid transport into the biliary canaliculi (BSEP) were significantly decreased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis compared to controls.

Similarly, bile acid efflux into the systemic circulation by MRP3 and MRP4 increased with worsening alcoholic hepatitis, as described previously in obstructive cholestasis.20,21

These changes in expression of bile acid transporters can be interpreted as a protective mechanism of the body to decrease the concentration of bile acids in the liver.

PARAGRAPH

FGF19 is classically produced and secreted in the ileum, and travels to the liver to suppress CYP7A1.10

FGF19 has been shown to be produced by epithelial cells of the gallbladder, hepatocytes, and hepatic stem cells in various diseases.10,16

FGF19 gene expression increased in the small and large intestine in alcoholic cirrhotics in relation to controls.12,22

In the current study, we are the first to show that FGF19 gene expression is also significantly increased in the liver in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, and that predominantly cholangiocytes and ductular cells from smaller ductules (progenitor cells) produce FGF19, which is consistent with high FGF19 expression in bile duct cells from a human liver with biliary cirrhosis.23

Although a de novo induction of hepatic FGF19 is the likely cause for the dramatic increase of serum FGF19 in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, we cannot exclude the possibility that other organs might contribute to this systemic increase as well.

FGF19 gene expression was not significantly increased in patients with early alcoholic steatohepatitis compared with controls, which indicates that patients with alcohol use disorder do not induce FGF19 gene expression in the liver (Fig. 2A).

PARAGRAPH

Serum FGF19 was not significantly different in patients with NASH compared with healthy controls despite significantly increased C4 levels and increased total bile acid levels in the feces.15

This contrasts with alcoholic hepatitis where FGF19 serum levels are ∼100 times higher than in controls (Fig. 2A) whose levels were similar to patients with NASH.

Patients with alcoholic hepatitis have suppressed serum C4 levels, likely in response to high FGF19 levels, possibly as a protective mechanism of the body to decrease overall bile acid levels in the face of significantly elevated systemic bile acids.

PARAGRAPH

The MELD score correlated positively with several serum bile acids and with total bile acid levels, in particular with the contribution of conjugated bile acids to the overall percentage, taurine-conjugated bile acids, and markedly with T-CDCA.

There was also a significant negative correlation with G-DCA and conjugated DCA.

In alcoholic cirrhotics, total fecal bile acids, LCA, and DCA among others were negatively correlated with the MELD score, but CA or CDCA were not significantly correlated with the MELD score.22

These findings correspond to our own, and to a certain extent with developing cholestasis in worsening liver disease, which results in less secretion of bile acids into the intestine and hence less secondary bile acids such as DCA after metabolism by intestinal bacteria.

PARAGRAPH

FGF19 correlates positively with bilirubin and GGT in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, and hence with cholestasis.

It is also associated with fibrosis stage and PMN infiltration in a negative fashion in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

A negative correlation between FGF19 serum levels and hepatic fibrosis was also seen in pediatric onset intestinal failure.24

Injections with FGF19 reversed hepatic fibrosis in mice, supporting its beneficial effects.25

An increase in FGF19 could hence be viewed as an advantageous reaction of the body.

Severe PMN infiltration was associated with improved survival in an alcoholic hepatitis cohort.6

Therefore, a negative correlation of PMN infiltration with FGF19 appears deleterious in our alcoholic hepatitis group.

As FGF19 tends to increase with significant cholestasis (Table 5, Fig. 5D), we looked at a subgroup of patients with more severe alcoholic hepatitis (with MELD ≥29, >75th percentile).

In this subgroup FGF19 correlated positively with mortality (Table 6).

Whether this is causative or rather an expression of disease activity remains to be determined.

Given the beneficial anti-fibrotic and anti-cholestatic effects,25 advantageous metabolic effects26 and hepato-regenerative effects of FGF19,27 a compensatory upregulation of FGF19 by the body in response to worsening liver health appears more likely.

PARAGRAPH

This study has several limitations.

First and foremost, this study involves many centers and therefore there are differences in sampling and patient management.

Second, bile acids and C4 levels were only available for the exploratory patient cohort in whom alcoholic hepatitis was untreated.

Third, and in contrast to that, 30% of our larger cohort of 132 patients with alcoholic hepatitis were treated with steroids and 8% were treated with pentoxifylline, which might result in some heterogeneity.

PARAGRAPH

Taken together, FGF19 correlates with disease activity in alcoholic liver disease.

Serum FGF19 levels were positively associated with total bile acids, conjugated bile acids, conjugated/unconjugated bile acid ratio as well as T-CA, G-CA and conjugated CA.

Given its (highly) significant correlation with several bile acids and ability to be induced by the hepatic farnesoid X receptor (FXR [NR1H4]),18 therapeutic modulation of the master regulator of the bile acid metabolism, FXR, might present a therapeutic opportunity in alcoholic hepatitis.

Obeticholic acid, an FXR agonist, has been shown to improve alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin levels in primary biliary cholangitis in clinical trials.28

The FLINT trial demonstrated that obeticholic acid also improves ALT levels and histologic features of NASH.29

The FXR agonist obeticholic acid is currently being investigated in patients with moderately severe alcoholic hepatitis (TREAT, NCT02039219 on ClinicalTrials.gov).

PARAGRAPH

The FGF19 analogue NGM282 is currently being investigated in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (NCT02135536 on ClinicalTrials.gov).

NGM282 reduced non-invasive fibrosis markers and fat liver content in patients with NASH.30

Given convincing results after interventions with FGF19 or analogues in experimental cholestatic and alcoholic liver disease,25,26 human trials with FGF19 or derivatives in alcoholic hepatitis could be considered.
