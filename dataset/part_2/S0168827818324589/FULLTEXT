TITLE

NK-cell responses are biased towards CD16-mediated effector functions in chronic hepatitis B virus infection

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a non-cytopathic DNA virus that triggers immune-mediated liver pathology.

It is estimated that 257 million people worldwide are suffering from chronic HBV (cHBV) infection and are therefore at high risk of developing progressive liver disease.

The capacity of the immune system to control HBV infection provides a rationale for immunotherapeutic approaches.

Direct and indirect roles of natural killer (NK) cells in mediating anti-HBV immunity have been described.1,2

For example, in a hydrodynamic injection model of acute HBV infection, a direct antiviral effect of NK cells has been reported.3

In that model, NK cells can also indirectly support HBV clearance by positively affecting HBV-specific T-cell responses via interferon γ (IFNγ) secretion.4

However, in cHBV infection NK cells exhibit an impaired IFNγ production, consequently leading to reduced non-cytolytic antiviral potential and diminished support of T-cell responses.5,6

A landmark study has also shown that despite their reduced cytokine production, NK cells obtained from patients with cHBV displayed a conserved cytotoxic function.

This phenomenon has been termed functional dichotomy.5

PARAGRAPH

The repertoire of human NK cells is altered in human cytomegalovirus seropositive (HCMV+) compared to HCMV seronegative (HCMV-) patients.7–11

In particular, expansion of phenotypically and functionally distinct NK-cell subsets can be observed for long periods of time, giving these cells memory-like properties.8,12–16

The expanded memory-like NK-cell subsets are characterized by the expression of NKG2C, or CD2, and in cases of homozygous NKG2C (KLRC2) deletion, by the lack of the adaptor protein FcεRIγ and by distinct epigenetic profiles that are similar to CD8 T cells.12,13,17,18

Especially the lack of FcεRIγ marks memory-like NK cells that provide superior effector function in response to antibody triggering mediated by the FcγRIII (CD16).12,13

PARAGRAPH

HCMV is universally distributed among human populations.19

In cHBV patients HCMV coinfection is common20 and HCMV-associated expansions of NK-cell populations are also evident.21,22

However, to date it is not clear whether HCMV infection and its associated expansion of memory-like NK cells promotes NK-cell alterations observed in cHBV infection.

To address this, we focused on CD56dim NK cells, the majority of circulating NK cells, and performed comparative analyses of conventional FcεRIγ+ vs. memory-like FcεRIγ- subsets obtained from the blood of patients with cHBV and healthy donors (HD).

We detected memory-like FcεRIγ- NK-cell subsets in the majority of patients with cHBV/HCMV+, and with a higher prevalence compared to HD/HCMV+.

Comprehensive phenotypic, functional, metabolic and epigenetic analyses further revealed that the distinct characteristics of conventional FcεRIγ+ and memory-like FcεRIγ- NK cells were largely conserved, except for a generally increased CD16-mediated degranulation/cytotoxicity in patients with cHBV/HCMV+ compared to HD/HCMV+.

Thus, cHBV-associated CD56dim NK-cell alterations directly correlated with the frequency of the memory-like FcεRIγ- subsets present in patients with cHBV/HCMV+.

In summary, an increase in CD16-mediated CD56dim NK-cell effector function linked to the pronounced expansion of FcεRIγ- memory-like NK cells that have per se a superior CD16 responsiveness revealed that the NK-cell response in cHBV infection is biased towards CD16-mediated effector functions.

Results

SECTION

Increased frequencies of memory-like FcεRIγ- NK cells in the peripheral blood of patients with cHBV/HCMV+

PARAGRAPH

To assess the presence of memory-like NK cells in cHBV infection, we first analyzed FcεRIγ expression (Fig. S1) in circulating CD56dim NK cells obtained from cHBV patients compared to patients with cHCV and HD (Table S1-3).

As depicted in Fig. 1A, FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells were present in patients with cHBV, cHCV and HD.

FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells were only detectable in patients who were HCMV+, clearly demonstrating linkage to HCMV infection.

In contrast to patients with cHCV/HCMV+, the frequency of circulating FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells in patients with cHBV/HCMV+ was significantly increased compared to HD/HCMV+.

In addition, the prevalence of HCMV+ individuals harboring FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells (defined as >10% FcεRIγ- of CD56dim NK cells) was also increased in patients with cHBV compared to HD (Fig. 1B).

Thus, memory-like FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells are more common in patients with cHBV/HCMV+ both in frequency and prevalence.

Yet, we did not find any correlation in the frequency of FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells with viral load, serum aminotransferase levels or treatment in patients with cHBV and frequencies remained stable for years during nucleos(t)ide analog therapy (Fig. S2).

SECTION

Key characteristics of memory-like FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells are conserved in cHBV infection

PARAGRAPH

To evaluate whether FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells share key characteristics in patients with cHBV/HCMV+ and HD/HCMV+, we comparatively analyzed expression of the signaling molecules EAT2 and Syk, the transcriptional regulators PLZF and Helios and of the maturation/differentiation markers CD57 and CD7.

EAT2, Syk, PLZF, Helios and CD7 are marker molecules that are downregulated whereas CD57 is upregulated in memory-like FcεRIγ- compared to conventional FcεRIγ+ CD56dim NK cells.12,13

As shown (Fig. 2A), FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells obtained from patients with cHBV/HCMV+ expressed similar levels of EAT2 as FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells obtained from HD/HCMV+.

Furthermore, frequencies of FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells expressing Syk, PLZF, Helios, CD7 and CD57 were similar in patients with cHBV/HCMV+ and HD/HCMV+ (Fig. 2B-F).

Taken together, key characteristics of FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells from cHBV/HCMV+ patients and HD/HCMV+ are similar, suggesting a conserved profile of this memory-like NK-cell subset in cHBV/HCMV+.

SECTION

Frequencies of memory-like FcεRIγ- subsets determine NK-cell receptor expression on CD56dim NK cells in cHBV infection

PARAGRAPH

In cHBV infection, an altered NK-cell phenotype has been reported.23

Therefore, in a next set of experiments, we addressed the question of whether these phenotypic alterations are affected by the frequency of the memory-like FcεRIγ- NK-cell subsets that exhibit a changed NK-cell receptor pattern compared to conventional NK cells.12

For this, we analyzed NK-cell receptor expression on FcεRIγ-based CD56dim NK-cell subsets from patients with cHBV/HCMV+ and HD/HCMV+.

To take potential cHBV-associated FcεRIγ subset-specific effects into account, we first analyzed the NK-cell receptor expression on FcεRIγ- and FcεRIγ+ CD56dim NK cells, respectively, and compared cells obtained from patients with cHBV/HCMV+ and HD/HCMV+.

Expression of CD2, NKG2C, NKG2A, NKG2D, NKp30 and Siglec-7 were similar on FcεRIγ+ NK cells (Fig. 3A-C and Fig. S3A).

NKp46 expression was only slightly increased (Fig. 3D) in conventional FcεRIγ+ CD56dim NK cells from patients with cHBV/HCMV+ compared to HD/HCMV+.

In addition, conserved expression of all tested NK-cell receptors was evident for memory-like FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells from patients with cHBV/HCMV+ and from HD/HCMV+ (Fig. 3A-F).

Thus, NK-cell receptor expression of CD2, NKG2C, NKG2A, NKG2D, NKp30, NKp46 and Siglec-7 was barely altered in cHBV infection with respect to FcεRIγ-based CD56dim NK-cell subsets.

However, with the exception of NKG2D, expression of these NK-cell receptors was different between memory-like FcεRIγ- and conventional FcεRIγ+ CD56dim NK cells, irrespective of whether the cells were derived from cHBV/HCMV+ patients or from HD/HCMV+ (Fig. 3A-F and Fig. S3A/B).

Consequently, expression of CD2, NKG2C, NKG2A, NKp30, NKp46 and Siglec-7 on bulk CD56dim NK cells from patients with cHBV correlated with the frequency of memory-like FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells (Fig. 3F).

In summary, HBV-associated alterations of NK-cell receptor expression on CD56dim NK cells was linked to the HCMV-associated expansion of memory-like FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells in cHBV infection.

SECTION

Increased homeostatic proliferation of memory-like FcεRIγ- and conventional FcεRIγ+ CD56dim NK cells in cHBV infection

PARAGRAPH

Based on the observation that the profiles of FcεRIγ-based CD56dim NK-cell subsets in cHBV infection are largely conserved, we wondered whether the homeostatic characteristics remain unaffected by the presence of chronic infection.

As measures of homeostatic proliferation and survival capacity, we analyzed Ki-67 and BCL2 expression, respectively, directly ex vivo in FcεRIγ- and FcεRIγ+ CD56dim NK-cell subsets from patients with cHBV/HCMV+ and HD/HCMV+.

In line with previous reports in HD/HCMV+,15 Ki-67 expression (Fig. 4A) was significantly decreased and BCL2 expression (Fig. 4B) was significantly increased in memory-like FcεRIγ- compared to conventional FcεRIγ+ CD56dim NK cells in patients with cHBV/HCMV+.

Interestingly, expression of Ki-67 was significantly increased in CD56dim NK cells obtained from patients with cHBV/HCMV+ compared to HD/HCMV+, irrespective of the FcεRIγ-based subset (Fig. 4C) whereas BCL2 levels were similar (Fig. 4D).

In summary, memory-like FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells seem to be more quiescent than FcεRIγ+ subsets despite a general increase in homeostatic proliferation in cHBV infection.

SECTION

Increased CD16-mediated degranulation of memory-like FcεRIγ- and conventional FcεRIγ+ CD56dim NK cells in cHBV infection

PARAGRAPH

In the next set of experiments, we explored the functional properties of memory-like FcεRIγ- compared to conventional FcεRIγ+ CD56dim NK cells in cHBV infection.

First, we assessed the degranulation capacity via the surrogate marker CD107a and the IFNγ production after crosslinking of CD16 by plate-bound monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 5A).

CD16 mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of NK cells.

We observed a CD16-induced increased degranulation and IFNγ production of FcεRIγ- compared to FcεRIγ+ CD56dim NK cells in cHBV/HCMV+ infection (Fig. 5A).

Of note, CD16-mediated degranulation and IFNγ production of bulk CD56dim NK cells from patients with cHBV correlated with the frequencies of memory-like FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells (Fig. 5A).

In response to cytokine stimulation with either IL12/IL15 or IL12/18 (Fig. 5B), however, IFNγ production was diminished in FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells compared to FcεRIγ+ CD56dim NK cells obtained from patients with cHBV/HCMV+.

Next, we compared the functional properties of FcεRIγ-based CD56dim NK-cell subsets in cHBV/HCMV+ infection and HD/HCMV+.

IFNγ production was conserved in FcεRIγ- and FcεRIγ+ subsets from patients with cHBV/HCMV+ compared to HD/HCMV+ irrespective of stimulation via CD16 (Fig. 5C) or cytokines (Fig. S4).

However, CD16-induced degranulation was significantly increased in FcεRIγ- and FcεRIγ+ CD56dim NK cells from patients with cHBV/HCMV+ compared to HD/HCMV+.

Hence, CD16-mediated CD56dim NK-cell effector function is increased in cHBV infection.

SECTION

Different metabolic properties of memory-like and conventional CD56dim NK cells are conserved in cHBV infection

PARAGRAPH

Since functional properties of NK cells are associated with alterations in metabolic pathways,24 we next tested whether we can also detect metabolic changes comparing memory-like and conventional CD56dim NK-cell subsets from patients with cHBV/HCMV+ and HD/HCMV+.

First, we assessed glucose uptake that is increased in cells with active glycolysis.

Since intracellular staining was not compatible with protocols assessing metabolic properties, we defined memory-like NK cells by the cell surface markers NKG2C, CD57 or CD2 instead of using FcεRIγ expression (Fig. S5A).

Glucose uptake was reduced in memory-like NK cells compared to conventional NK cells in patients with cHBV/HCMV+ (Fig. 6A, Fig. S5B).

A prerequisite for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is an intact mitochondrial membrane and polarized mitochondria.

We therefore analyzed fluctuations in mitochondrial membrane potential via Mito-ID (Fig. 6B, Fig. S5C).

A higher fraction of memory-like compared to conventional NK cells obtained from patients with cHBV/HCMV+ displayed polarized and thus functional mitochondria, whereas mitochondrial mass was similar (Fig. S6A).

As shown, the metabolic properties of memory-like and conventional CD56dim NK-cell subsets were similar in patients with cHBV/HCMV+ and HD/HCMV+ (Fig. 6C,D; Fig. S5D,E; Fig. S6B).

Thus, while memory-like and conventional CD56dim NK cells differ in their metabolic characteristics, cHBV infection does not alter glucose uptake and OXPHOS under steady-state conditions.

SECTION

Memory-like CD56dim NK cells can be subdivided in FcεRIγ/Helios-based subsets with a stable epigenetic signature in cHBV infection

PARAGRAPH

Memory cells of the adaptive immune system are comprised of different subsets with distinct phenotypic and functional characteristics.

We therefore wondered whether memory-like CD56dim NK cells are also heterogeneous.

For this, we performed FcεRIγ/Helios co-expression analyses of CD56dim NK cells obtained from patients with cHBV/HCMV+ since downregulation of both molecules has been linked to HCMV-associated memory-like subsets.12,13

We observed the presence of 4 FcεRIγ/Helios-based CD56dim NK-cell subsets: subset I, FcεRIγ+Helios+; subset II, FcεRIγ+Helios-; subset III, FcεRIγ-Helios-; subset IV, FcεRIγ-Helios+.

The FcεRIγ+Helios+ conventional subset represented the highest proportion of CD56dim NK cells, followed by FcεRIγ-Helios- and FcεRIγ+Helios- subsets.

FcεRIγ-Helios+ CD56dim NK cells represented the least frequent subset in patients with cHBV.

All FcεRIγ/Helios-based NK-cell subsets were also present in HD (Fig. S6A), suggesting a conserved subset diversification of memory-like CD56dim NK cells in the context of cHBV infection.

As shown, PLZF was significantly downregulated in FcεRIγ- subsets III and IV compared to the conventional FcεRIγ+Helios+ NK-cell subset I (Fig. 7B).

In addition, NKG2C was upregulated in subsets II (FcεRIγ+Helios-), III (FcεRIγ-Helios-) and IV (FcεRIγ-Helios+) compared to conventional NK cells (Fig. 7B, right).

Furthermore, CD16-induced degranulation was increased in FcεRIγ-Helios- subset III, compared to conventional FcεRIγ+Helios+ NK cells (Fig. 7C).

IFNγ production of subsets II-IV compared to conventional FcεRIγ+Helios+ NK cells of subset I was substantially decreased in response to cytokine stimulation (Fig. 7D) pointing towards memory-like functional features generally biased towards CD16-mediated effector functions.

PARAGRAPH

To further confirm the memory-like profile of FcεRIγ/Helios-based CD56dim NK-cell subsets II-IV, we determined methylation patterns of the FCER1G and IFNG promoter, reported to be distinct in memory-like vs. conventional NK cells.12,13,25

For this, we FACS-sorted FcεRIγ/Helios-based NK-cell subsets derived from 4 patients with cHBV/HCMV+ and 2 HD/HCMV+ and subsequently performed bisulfite sequencing of genomic DNA.

We detected hypermethylation of the FCER1G promoter in CD56dim NK-cell subsets lacking FcεRIγ expression (subset III and IV; Fig. 7E).

Furthermore, CpG hypomethylation of the IFNG CNS1 region in FcεRIγ/Helios-based NK-cell subsets II, III and IV (Fig. 7F), and of the proximal IFNG promoter in subset III (Fig. 7G), not only associated epigenetic marks, reported for memory-like NK cells, to CD56dim NK-cell subsets with decreased FcεRIγ expression, but also linked diminished Helios expression to epigenetic regulation associated with memory-like NK-cell differentiation in patients with cHBV/HCMV+ and HD/HCMV+ (Fig. 7F, G).

In summary, co-expression of FcεRIγ and Helios diversifies phenotypically, functionally and epigenetically distinct memory-like CD56dim NK-cell subsets with a stable signature in cHBV infection.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In patients with cHBV, HCMV has a high prevalence.20

HCMV establishes lifelong infection with alternating phases of latency and reactivation of productive infection.

The lifelong persistence of HCMV leads to a dynamic interplay of the virus and the immune response resulting in imprinted changes of the immune system.26,27

Moreover, the liver is a major site of HCMV replication.28,29

HBV can establish a chronic and therefore actively persisting infection that is also associated with alterations in the immune response.30,31

This study now revealed that the NK-cell repertoire of patients with cHBV/HCMV+ is mutually affected by HCMV and cHBV coinfection, indicating co-adaptation to both persisting infections.

PARAGRAPH

We observed that HCMV-associated expansion of memory-like FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells in cHBV was increased compared to HD.

This increase was evident in both prevalence and frequency, probably resulting from facilitated induction and pronounced expansion of memory-like FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells in cHBV/HCMV+ infection.

The mechanisms responsible for this pronounced expansion of memory-like FcεRIγ- NK-cell subsets in cHBV/HCMV+ infection are unclear.

For example, enforced repetitive HCMV reactivation in the context of cHBV infection may lead to boosted FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK-cell expansion, especially since HCMV reactivation has been shown to induce memory-like NK-cell expansion in hematopoetic stem cell transplantations.32,33

Yet, clinical HCMV reactivation was not diagnosed in the patients with cHBV/HCMV+, cHCV/HCMV+ or HD/HCMV+ analyzed in this study.

However, sub-clinical or tissue-specific HCMV reactivations cannot be excluded.

In addition, it has been reported that FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells obtained from HD/HCMV+ strongly proliferated in response to anti-HCMV IgG targeted HCMV-infected cells12,13 and memory-like NK cells in patients infected with HIV correlated with HCMV serum antibody levels.34,35

Hence, antibodies targeting HCMV- and/or HBV-derived epitopes may also play a role in the enhanced expansion of FcεRIγ- NK-cell subsets in patients with cHBV/HCMV+.

Other reasons for enhanced memory-like FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK-cell expansion may include genetic factors, e.g. combined KIR/MHC class I repertoire, inflammatory cytokines and selection of distinct HCMV strains.36–40

Indeed, HCMV-associated NK-cell expansions, as well as chronic hepatitis, have previously been associated with self-reactive KIR expression.21,38

Furthermore, the cytokine IL12 has been shown to represent a key player in memory-like NK-cell expansion in a cell culture model,41 and elevated levels of IL12 were detectable in sera of patients with cHBV.42

PARAGRAPH

An HCMV-associated expansion of NKG2C+ NK cells in chronic viral hepatitis, including cHBV and cHCV infection, has previously been reported.21,22

In this study, we showed that a large fraction of FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells express NKG2C and that frequencies of NKG2C+ and FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells correlate with cHBV/HCMV+ infection.

Thus, NKG2C+ and FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK-cell expansions most likely represent overlapping observations.

Yet, it has been recently shown that HCMV-associated expansion of NKG2C+ NK cells is not affected by concomitant cHBV infection.22

As depicted by our phenotypic analyses, this most probably reflects the fact that NKG2C+ and FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells do not completely represent the same populations.

However, further analyses, e.g. by single cell RNA sequencing, are necessary to integrate heterogeneous phenotypes of expanded memory-like NK-cell populations and to reveal their relationship.

In line with this, we demonstrated that HCMV-associated memory-like NK cells are indeed not homogeneous.

FcεRIγ/Helios co-expression defines 3 phenotypically, functionally and epigenetically distinct memory-like CD56dim NK-cell subsets contrasting with conventional FcεRIγ+ Helios+ CD56dim NK cells.

NKG2C, for example, was upregulated on all memory-like subsets, also on memory-like FcεRIγ+ Helios- CD56dim NK cells revealing a memory-like CD56dim NK-cell subset that co-expresses FcεRIγ and NKG2C.

Of note, CD56dim NK cells that lack FcεRIγ expression still constituted the majority of memory-like NK cells.

PARAGRAPH

HCMV-associated memory-like FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells exhibit a distinct molecular signature compared with conventional FcεRIγ+ CD56dim NK cells sharing similarities with CD8+ T cells.12,13

Here, we demonstrated that this phenotypic, functional and epigenetic profile, as well as the transcriptional regulation of memory-like FcεRIγ- NK-cell subsets is mostly conserved in patients with cHBV/HCMV+ despite ongoing chronic infection.

This is in stark contrast to CD8+ T cells that exhibit different molecular signatures in chronic infections.43

Furthermore, our data show that memory-like NK cells exhibit different metabolic properties to conventional NK cells, including reduced steady-state glucose uptake and increased capacity for OXPHOS characteristic for long-living/resting cells.

This is in line with a recent study by Cichocki et al. showing that memory-like/adaptive NK cells exhibit increased OXPHOS linked to the upregulation of the transcriptional regulator ARID5B.44

Importantly, in this study, we observed that the steady-state metabolic profile, specifically glucose uptake and mitochondrial membrane potential, of memory-like and conventional NK cells was similar in patients with cHBV/HCMV+ and HD/HCMV+, confirming the high stability of HCMV-associated CD56dim NK-cell subsets in chronic infection.

With respect to metabolism, memory-like NK cells also behave differently to CD8+ T cells that exhibit an altered metabolism in chronic infection.45

Hence, despite molecular, especially epigenetic similarities of memory-like NK cells and CD8+ T cells, these cells are clearly different with respect to their adaptation in chronic infection.

PARAGRAPH

Based on the largely conserved phenotype of both FcεRIγ- and FcεRIγ+ CD56dim NK-cell subsets in patients with cHBV/HCMV+, the relative diversification of these 2 distinct subsets is closely linked to the overall profile of CD56dim NK cells in cHBV infection.

Hence due to the additionally high prevalence of HCMV in patients with cHBV, HCMV-associated FcεRIγ- NK cells consequently represent major determinants of CD56dim NK-cell alterations observed in the context of cHBV infection.

This is even consolidated by the enhanced expansion of FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells in patients with cHBV/HCMV+ compared to HD/HCMV+.

Of note, FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK-cell expansion was similar in patients with cHCV/HCMV+ and HD/HCMV+ and it has recently been reported that HCMV infection does not determine NK-cell alterations in cHCV infection,46 contrasting with our aforementioned findings in cHBV infection.

However, we also detected a few properties of CD56dim NK cells that differ in patients with cHBV/HCMV+ compared to HD/HCMV+, irrespective of FcεRIγ expression.

In particular, we observed a higher homeostatic proliferation and increased CD16-mediated degranulation of CD56dim NK cells, demonstrating cHBV-specific effects on the overall NK-cell repertoire including HCMV-associated NK-cell populations.

The underlying molecular mechanisms of these cHBV-specific NK-cell alterations remain to be clarified.

Yet, it has been previously reported that IL10 and TGFB1 can contribute to changes in NK-cell functionality in patients with cHBV.6

PARAGRAPH

In summary, this study shows that based on mutual effects of HCMV infection and HBV chronicity, the NK-cell repertoire in patients with cHBV/HCMV+ is biased towards CD16-mediated effector functions, thereby supporting the antibody-dependent immune response.

Specifically, a general increase of CD16-mediated degranulation and enhanced expansion of FcεRIγ- CD56dim NK cells with higher CD16-mediated effector capacity are evident.

Hence, this study underpins the knowledge that co-infection, especially with HCMV, can shape the immune repertoire and consequently affects the immune response in cHBV infection.

Therefore, coinfection must be considered in the design and application of new immunotherapeutic approaches for HBV cure that involve NK cells, e.g. TLR7 agonists47 or antibody-mediated checkpoint blockade.
