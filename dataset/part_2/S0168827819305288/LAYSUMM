TITLE

IL-17A secreted from lymphatic endothelial cells promotes tumorigenesis by upregulation of PD-L1 in hepatoma stem cells

PARAGRAPH

The microenvironment is crucial for the self-renewal and development of hepatoma stem cells, which lead to the development of liver cancer.

Lymphatic endothelial cells are an important component of this niche microenvironment, helping hepatoma stem cells to self-renew and escape immune attack, by upregulating IL-17A signaling.

Thus, targeting IL-17A signaling is a potential strategy for the treatment of hepatoma.
