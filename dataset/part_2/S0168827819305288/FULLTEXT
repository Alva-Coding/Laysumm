TITLE

IL-17A secreted from lymphatic endothelial cells promotes tumorigenesis by upregulation of PD-L1 in hepatoma stem cells

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatoma stem cells are thought to be responsible for the initial development, progression and therapeutic resistance of hepatomas.1

For example, CD133+ hepatoma cells highly express stemness genes, possess multi-lineage differentiation capabilities and are highly tumorigenic in immunocompromised mice.2,3

Exploring the mechanisms behind the highly tumorigenic nature of hepatoma stem cells will contribute to the development of therapeutic approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma.

PARAGRAPH

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) exist in a cellular niche comprised of numerous cell types.4,5

For example, tumor-associated macrophages promote the survival and self-renewal of CSCs.6

Lymphatic vessels are one of the major routes by which cancer cells disseminate.7

Increasing evidence has shown that lymphatic endothelial cells regulate tumor cell behaviors.

For example, lymphatic endothelial cells recruit CXCR4- or CCR7-expressing cancer cells by chemo-attraction.8

In addition, lymphatic endothelial cells secrete factors to support tumor cell proliferation.9

Thus, lymphatic endothelial cell serves as an important component of the tumor microenvironment.

However, the mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between CSCs and lymphatic endothelial cells remain largely unknown.

PARAGRAPH

Here, we examined the mechanism by which lymphatic endothelial cells promoted the self-renewal of hepatoma stem cells.

We found that lymphatic endothelial cells create a CSC-niche through direct contact with hepatoma stem cells.

This niche promotes the self-renewal and immune escape of hepatoma stem cells.

Isolation of CD133+ and CD133− cells

PARAGRAPH

CD133+ cells were isolated from xenografts formed by hepatoma cell lines or human hepatoma tissues as previously described.10

Human hepatoma tissues were obtained in accordance with protocols approved by the Ethics Committees of School of Basic medical of Fudan University.

CD133+ and CD133− cells were separated through magnetic cell sorting with a CD133 Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec).

SECTION

Tumor-initiating capacity of tumor cells

PARAGRAPH

To examine the tumor-initiating capacity of tumor cells, tumor cells were orthotopically transplanted into 7-week old immunodeficient mice in accordance with protocols approved by School of Basic medical of Fudan University Animal Care and Use Committee.

Tumor formation was determined by histology.

SECTION

SECTION

Interaction between hepatoma stem cells and lymphatic endothelial cells

PARAGRAPH

To examine the association between hepatoma stem cells and lymphatic endothelial cells, hepatoma tissues were analyzed by immunofluorescence with anti-CD133 (hepatoma stem cell marker) and anti-LYVE-1 or anti-VEGFR3 (lymphatic endothelial cell marker) antibodies.

Juxtaposition of lymphatic endothelial cells with CD133+ hepatoma cells was detected in hepatoma tissues (Fig. 1A-B).

To examine whether hepatoma stem cells adhered to lymphatic endothelial cells, CD133+ or CD133− cells were isolated from Huh-7 and PLC/PRF/5 xenograft, or HCC samples (patient #1-#3).

Consistent with previous reports,2,12 CD133+ hepatoma cells showed characteristics consistent with CSCs, including sphere formation (Fig. S1A), expressing stem cell markers (Fig. S1B-F), multi-lineage differentiation capacity (Fig. S1G), and highly tumorigenic potential in immunocompromised mice (Fig. S1H-I).

Human lymphatic endothelial cells were isolated from HCC samples by immunomagnetic purification as previously described.13

Isolated lymphatic endothelial cells expressed lymphatic endothelial cell markers VEGFR3, LYVE-1 and podoplanin (Fig. S1J), and formed tube-like structures that were similar to lymphatic endothelial cells (Fig. S1K).

PARAGRAPH

To examine the adherence of hepatoma stem cells to lymphatic endothelial cells, CD133+ or CD133− cells isolated from Huh-7 and PLC/PRF/5 xenografts or HCC samples (patient #1-#3) labeled with mCherry (red fluorescent protein) were laid on top of lymphatic endothelial cells labeled with GFP (green fluorescent protein) (Fig. 1C).

Compared to CD133− hepatoma cells, more CD133+ hepatoma cells isolated from xenografts or HCC samples adhered to lymphatic endothelial cells (Fig. 1D-E).

To examine the ability of hepatoma stem cells to adhere to lymphatic endothelial cells during differentiation, in vitro differentiation of CD133+ cells was induced by 2% serum.

Compared to differentiated cells induced by 2% serum, more CD133+ hepatoma cells isolated from xenografts or HCC samples adhered to lymphatic endothelial cells (Fig. 1F).

Thus, CD133+ hepatoma stem cells preferentially interact with lymphatic endothelial cells.

SECTION

Mannose receptor mediates the interaction between CD133+ hepatoma cells and lymphatic endothelial cells

PARAGRAPH

To examine the mechanism of the interaction between CD133+ hepatoma cells and lymphatic endothelial cells, plasma membrane proteins of biotinylated CD133+ cells isolated from patient #1 sample were incubated with plasma membrane extraction of lymphatic endothelial cells.

The proteins which interacted with CD133+ cells were purified by NeutrAvidin agarose and were then subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis.

The peptides sequences matched the mannose receptor (CD206) (Fig. 2A).

Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the mannose receptor was expressed on lymphatic endothelial cells and co-localized with CD133+ cells in human hepatoma tissues (Fig. 2B).

By flow cytometry analysis, the binding of PE-tagged mannose receptor protein to CD133+ cells isolated from HCC samples (patient #1-#2) was higher than to CD133− cells (Fig. 2C; Fig. S2A).

Treatment with anti-mannose receptor antibody reduced the adherence of CD133+ cells isolated from xenograft (Huh-7 or PLC/PRF/5) or HCC samples (patient #1-#2) to lymphatic endothelial cells (Fig. 2D).

Downregulation of mannose receptor by siRNA in lymphatic endothelial cells (Fig. S2B), inhibited the adherence of CD133+ cells isolated from xenograft (Huh-7 or PLC/PRF/5) or HCC samples (patient #1 and #2) to lymphatic endothelial cells (Fig. 2E).

PARAGRAPH

Mannose receptor, a member of C-type lectins, binds to terminal high-mannose-type oligosaccharide.14,15

N-glycans are mainly classified into 3 types: high-mannose type, hybrid type and complex type (Fig. S2C).16,17

To examine the structural characteristics of N-glycan in CD133+ cells, flow cytometry analysis was performed using FITC-conjugated PHA-L which interacts with the Galβ1 → 4GlcNAcβ1 → 6Man branch, or FITC-conjugated ConA which preferentially interacts with high-mannose N-glycans.

Compared to CD133− cells, CD133+ hepatoma cells isolated from Huh-7 xenograft or HCC sample (patient #2) were found to have high levels of high-mannose type N-glycans (Fig. 2F; Fig. S2D-F).

Compared to differentiated cells induced by 2% FBS, CD133+ hepatoma cells isolated from Huh-7 xenograft or HCC patient #1 sample were found to have high levels of high-mannose type N-glycans (Fig. S2G-J).

Thus, the N-glycans on CD133+ hepatoma stem cells might be predominantly high-mannose type N-glycans.

PARAGRAPH

The addition of mannose, but not of sucrose, obviously inhibited the adherence of CD133+ cells isolated from xenograft (Huh-7 or PLC/PRF/5) or patient #1 HCC sample to lymphatic endothelial cells (Fig. 2G).

Consistent with this, treatment with Con A lectin inhibited the adherence of CD133+ cells isolated from xenografts (Huh-7 or PLC/PRF/5) to lymphatic endothelial cells (Fig. S2K).

Thus, the interaction between the mannose receptor and high-mannose type N-glycan promotes the interaction between CD133+ hepatoma cells and lymphatic endothelial cells.

SECTION

The co-culture of CD133+ hepatoma cells with lymphatic endothelial cells promotes IL-17A expression

PARAGRAPH

The interaction between the mannose receptor and its ligand promotes IL-17A expression.18

Mannose treatment increased the expression of IL-17A in lymphatic endothelial cells, which could be blocked by mannose receptor siRNA (Fig. S3A), indicating that the binding of mannose to the mannose receptor promotes IL-17A expression in lymphatic endothelial cells.

Compared to CD133− cells, the co-culture of CD133+ hepatoma cells, isolated from xenografts, with lymphatic endothelial cells significantly increased IL-17A mRNA level and protein level (Fig. 3A-B) and promoted IL-17A secretion (Fig. S3B).

Immunofluorescence staining showed the positive expression of IL-17A in lymphatic endothelial cells in hepatoma tissues (Fig. 3C-D).

PARAGRAPH

To examine the mechanism of co-culture of CD133+ hepatoma cells with lymphatic endothelial cells promoting IL-17A expression, lymphatic endothelial cells expressing reporter vector pGL3-IL-17A-promoter were co-cultured with CD133+ cells or CD133− cells isolated from xenograft (Huh-7 or PLC/PRF/5).

Compared to CD133− cells, the co-culture of CD133+ cells with lymphatic endothelial cells increased the activity of the IL-17A promoter (Fig. 3E), which could be reduced by downregulation of the mannose receptor in lymphatic endothelial cells (Fig. 3E).

Consistent with this, treatment with Con A lectin reduced the activation of the IL-17A promoter by co-culture of CD133+ cells with lymphatic endothelial cells (Fig. S3C).

Thus, the interaction between lymphatic endothelial cells and hepatoma stem cells promotes IL-17A transcription by activating mannose receptor signaling.

PARAGRAPH

IL-17A was derived mainly from CD4+ T cells and γδT cells in cancer.19–21

Using a quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay, the expression of IL-17A in lymphatic endothelial cells was lower than in CD4+ T cells, but higher than in natural killer cells or vascular endothelial cells (Fig. S3D).

However, the mannose receptor was highly expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells as compared to CD4+ T cells or vascular endothelial cells or natural killer cells (Fig. S3E).

Together, the co-culture of CD133+ hepatoma stem cells with lymphatic endothelial cells promotes IL-17A expression.

SECTION

IL-17A promotes the immune escape of CD133+ hepatoma cells through upregulation of PD-L1

PARAGRAPH

CSCs are more resistant to immunological control than non-CSCs.22,23

CD8+ T cells (cytotoxic T cells) play a central role in immunity to cancer.24

To examine the effect of IL-17A on the immune escape of hepatoma stem cells, CD133+ cells isolated from Huh-7 or PLC/PRF/5 xenografts were pretreated with IL-17A and then co-cultured with activated CD8+ T cells.

IL-17A reduced the percentage of apoptotic CD133+ cells isolated from xenografts induced by CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4A-B).

Supernatant from the co-culture of CD133+ cells, isolated from Huh-7 xenografts, with lymphatic endothelial cells reduced the percentage of apoptotic CD133+ cells induced by CD8+ T cells.

This process was inhibited by downregulation of IL-17A or mannose receptor in lymphatic endothelial cells (Fig. S4A).

Thus, IL-17A from lymphatic endothelial cells promotes resistance of CD133+ hepatoma stem cells to CD8+ T cells.

PARAGRAPH

The interaction of PD-L1/2 on the tumor cells with PD-1 on CD8+ T cells reduces CD8+ T cells function.25,26

IL-17A induced PD-L1 expression in CD133+ cells without significantly changing PD-L2 expression (Fig. 4C-D).

Immunohistochemical staining showed that the expression of PD-L1 was obviously higher in xenografts formed by IL-17A-treated CD133+ hepatoma cells than by control-treated CD133+ cells (Fig. 4E-F; Fig. S4B).

Consistent with this, the supernatant from the co-culture of lymphatic endothelial cells with CD133+ cells, isolated from Huh-7 xenografts, induced the expression of PD-L1 in CD133+ cells (Fig. S4C).

Thus, IL-17A promotes PD-L1 expression in CD133+ hepatoma stem cells.

PARAGRAPH

Next, we examined the contribution of PD-L1 to the IL-17A-promoted resistance of CD133+ hepatoma cells to CD8+ T cells.

Anti-PD-L1 antibody reduced the positive effect of IL-17A on the resistance of CD133+ cells, isolated from Huh-7 xenografts, to CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4G).

Thus, IL-17A promotes the resistance of CD133+ hepatoma stem cells to CD8+ T cells through upregulation of PD-L1.

SECTION

IL-17A secreted from lymphatic endothelial cells promoted self-renewal of CD133+ hepatoma cells through upregulation of PD-L1

PARAGRAPH

PD-L1 promotes the self-renewal of CSCs.27

Supporting this notion, downregulation of PD-L1 by shRNA reduced sphere formation of CD133+ hepatoma cells isolated from Huh-7 or PLC/PRF/5 xenografts (Fig. 5A-C; Fig. S5A), and reduced the tumor-initiating capacity of CD133+ hepatoma cells isolated from Huh-7 or PLC/PRF/5 xenografts (Fig. S5B).

PD-L1 could activate Akt signaling,27,28 which promotes the self-renewal of CSCs.29

PD-L1 downregulation reduced Akt phosphorylation in CD133+ cells isolated from Huh-7 xenograft (Fig. S5C).

Overexpression of the active form of Akt (myr-Akt) rescued the negative effect of PD-L1 downregulation on the sphere formation of CD133+ hepatoma cells isolated from Huh-7 xenografts (Fig. S5D-E).

Thus, downregulation of PD-L1 inhibits the self-renewal and tumorigenesis of CD133+ hepatoma stem cells.

PARAGRAPH

Next, the contribution of upregulation of PD-L1 by IL-17A in the self-renewal of hepatoma stem cells was evaluated.

PD-L1 downregulation partly reduced the positive effect of IL-17A on sphere formation of CD133+ hepatoma cells isolated from Huh-7 and PLC/PRF/5 xenografts (Fig. 5D).

The supernatant from the co-culture of CD133+ hepatoma cells isolated from HCC samples with lymphatic endothelial cells significantly promoted the sphere formation of CD133+ cells, which was blocked by IL-17A downregulation in lymphatic endothelial cells (Fig. S5F), or PD-L1 downregulation in CD133+ hepatoma cells (Fig. 5E).

Together, IL-17A secreted from lymphatic endothelial cells promotes the self-renewal of CD133+ hepatoma cells, partly through upregulation of PD-L1.

PARAGRAPH

Next, we evaluated the contribution of IL-17A secreted from lymphatic endothelial cells to tumorigenesis of CD133+ hepatoma cells.

Co-injection with lymphatic endothelial cells promoted tumorigenesis of CD133+ hepatoma cells isolated from Huh-7 xenografts, which was partly blocked by downregulated expression of IL-17A in lymphatic endothelial cells (Fig. S5G).

VEGF-C stimulates lymphangiogenesis through binding to VEGFR3.30,31

Soluble VEGFR3 extracellular domains containing Ig homology domains 1-3 captures VEGF-C and thus blocks VEGFR3 signal activity, subsequently reducing lymphangiogenesis.32,33

CD133+ hepatoma cells isolated from Huh-7 and PLC/PRF/5 xenografts were orthotopically co-injected with sVEGFR3-Fc and/or IL-17A into immunodeficient mice.

Immunohistochemical analysis showed that sVEGFR3-Fc obviously reduced lymphangiogenesis in vivo (Fig. S5H).

Compared to Fc, sVEGFR3-Fc reduced the tumor-initiating capacity of CD133+ cells, isolated from Huh-7 and PLC/PRF/5 xenografts, which could be partly rescued by IL-17A protein (Fig. 5F-G).

Together, IL-17A secreted from lymphatic endothelial cells promotes CD133+ hepatoma stem cell tumorigenesis.

SECTION

IL-17A promoted PD-L1 transcription through activation of STAT3 phosphorylation

PARAGRAPH

IL-17A increased the level of PD-L1 mRNA (Fig. 6A).

Consistent with this, IL-17A increased the activity of the PD-L1 promoter in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 6B and Fig. S6A).

It has been reported that STAT3 binds to the PD-L1 promoter and activates PD-L1 transcription.34

IL-17A activates the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway.35

IL-17A increased STAT3 Y705 phosphorylation in CD133+ cells isolated from Huh-7 xenografts (Fig. 6C).

Downregulation of STAT3 blocked IL-17A-induced PD-L1 promoter activity (Fig. 6D), and reduced IL-17A-induced PD-L1 mRNA levels in CD133+ cells isolated from Huh-7 xenografts (Fig. 6E).

Thus, IL-17A promotes PD-L1 transcription through activation of STAT3 phosphorylation.

SECTION

IL-17A was highly expressed in hepatoma and IL-17A expression overlapped with PD-L1 expression

PARAGRAPH

Next, we investigated the characteristics of IL-17A expression during hepatoma progression.

Compared to para-tumor tissues, IL-17A was highly expressed in hepatoma (Fig. 7A-B; p <0.001).

Immunohistochemical staining for IL-17A in hepatoma tissues showed the diffusive expression of IL-17A in hepatoma (Fig. 7C).

Interestingly, IL-17A was partially expressed in single cells (Fig. 7D) or cells surrounding capillaries (Fig. 7E).

Considering that IL-17A promotes PD-L1 expression, the mRNA expression of IL-17A and PD-L1 in hepatoma samples was analyzed using qRT-PCR.

The IL-17A and PD-L1 mRNA levels exhibited a strong positive correlation in hepatoma tissues (Fig. 7F; R2 = 0.9086, p <0.01).

SECTION

Inhibition of IL-17A signaling pathway reduced the self-renewal ability and tumorigenesis of CD133+ hepatoma cells

PARAGRAPH

The contribution of IL-17A to hepatoma stem cells self-renewal motivated us to explore the effects of a IL-17 pathway inhibitor on the self-renewal of hepatoma stem cells.

Fc-fused proteins containing member protein extracellular domain are widely used to inhibit member protein interaction with its ligand.36,37

The extracellular domain of the IL-17A receptor was fused to the N-terminal region of Fc containing mouse IgG CH2 and CH3 domain (IL-17RA-Fc-6×His, Fig. 8A).

IL-17RA-Fc interacted with IL-17A (Fig. 8B) and reduced the binding of IL-17A to CD133+ hepatoma cells isolated from Huh-7 xenografts (Fig. 8C).

Thus, IL-17RA-Fc effectively reduces IL-17A signaling.

Compared to control, IL-17RA-Fc significantly reduced the positive effect of IL-17A on sphere formation of CD133+ hepatoma cells isolated from Huh-7 xenografts (Fig. 8D-E).

Furthermore, injection of IL-17RA-Fc protein reduced the growth in vivo of CD133+ hepatoma cells isolated from Huh-7 xenografts (Fig. 8F).

Together, inhibition of IL-17A signaling pathway by IL-17A receptor fusion protein reduces the self-renewal and tumorigenesis of CD133+ hepatoma stem cells.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Herein, we have shown that the interaction between the mannose receptor and high-mannose type glycans mediated the physical interactions between hepatoma stem cells and lymphatic endothelial cells.

This interaction activated cytokine IL-17A transcription and secretion.

IL-17A promoted self-renewal of hepatoma stem cells and their immune escape (Fig. 8G).

PARAGRAPH

The interactions between lectin and glycan regulate the cell microenvironment.38

Here, we have found that the structure of N-glycans in hepatoma stem cells was mainly high-mannose type N-glycans.

Treatment with Con A lectin recognizing high-mannose type N-glycans or mannose significantly reduced the adherence of CD133+ hepatoma stem cells to lymphatic endothelial cells.

Thus, high-mannose type N-glycans on hepatoma stem cells are required for their interaction with lymphatic endothelial cells.

However, the mechanism of high-mannose type N-glycan formation in hepatoma stem cells needs to be investigated further.

PARAGRAPH

IL-17A is mainly produced by CD4+ T cells and/or γδ T cells in a variety of tumors.19,39

We also showed that the expression of IL-17A in lymphatic endothelial cells was obviously lower than in CD4+ T cells.

However, the mannose receptor was highly expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells.

IL-17A from lymphatic endothelial cells promoted self-renewal of hepatoma stem cells and consequently tumorigenesis.

However, the effects of IL-17A from T cells on hepatoma stem cell behaviors need to be investigated further.

PARAGRAPH

Tumors utilize many different mechanisms to promote immune escape.40

PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 play a key role in tumor immune escape.41

IL-17A promotes immune escape of hepatoma stem cells at least partly through upregulation of PD-L1 expression.

Thus, the interactions between lymphatic endothelial cells and CSCs promote hepatoma stem cells immune escape in a paracrine manner.

PARAGRAPH

CSCs maintain their characteristics in a specific microenvironment.

Therefore, microenvironment-targeting strategies that could eliminate the CSC population might improve the clinical outcomes of patients with cancer.

Our findings have shown that neutralization of IL-17A signaling inhibited the self-renewal of hepatoma stem cells.

Thus, inhibition of IL-17A signaling may be a promising approach for hepatoma treatment.

PARAGRAPH

In summary, our results prove that lymphatic endothelial cells build a hepatoma stem cell niche.

IL-17A secreted from this niche promotes the self-renewal, tumorigenesis and immune escape of hepatoma stem cells.

These findings identify lymphatic endothelial cells as an important component of the hepatoma stem cell niche.
