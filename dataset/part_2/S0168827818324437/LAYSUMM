TITLE

Longitudinal correlations between MRE, MRI-PDFF, and liver histology in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: Analysis of data from a phase II trial of selonsertib

PARAGRAPH

Liver biopsy is a potentially painful and risky method to assess damage to the liver due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

We analyzed data from a clinical trial to determine if 2 methods of magnetic resonance imaging – 1 to measure liver fat and 1 to measure liver fibrosis (scarring) – could potentially replace liver biopsy in evaluating NASH-related liver injury.

Both imaging methods were correlated with biopsy in showing the effects of NASH on the liver.
