TITLE

Non-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging as a Surveillance Tool for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Comparison with Ultrasound

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

International guidelines recommend that patients at high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergo ultrasonography (US) every 6 months.1-3

Recent studies, however, revealed that US had low sensitivity: only 63% in detecting early HCC and approximately 20% in detecting very early stage HCC.4-6

Recently revised guidelines now suggest that selected patients with inadequate US examinations be assessed by alternative methods, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).1-3

Various HCC surveillance protocols using CT or MRI have been investigated.6-12

Because of the repetitive nature of surveillance tests, the cumulative radiation hazard of periodic CT scans should not be neglected.13

Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI has shown excellent performance in diagnosing HCC,14,15 suggesting that periodic MRI may be the best option for HCC surveillance.6

However, the high cost and long imaging acquisition time of full-protocol gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI can hamper its widespread use.

Abbreviated MRI protocols, including hepatobiliary phase (HBP) imaging using gadoxetic acid without dynamic enhanced images, have therefore been tested.8,9,12

Regardless of the inclusion of dynamic sequences, however, gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI has various drawbacks associated with the use of gadolinium agent, including its long-term retention in human tissues.16,17

PARAGRAPH

Non-enhanced MRI, consisting of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), may be a candidate alternative surveillance tool for HCC,18,19 because diffusion restriction and mild to moderate T2 hyperintensity are ancillary imaging features for malignancy.1

Especially DWI has shown excellent performance in detecting HCC.11,20,21

However, previous studies18,19 evaluating non-enhanced MRI for HCC surveillance were retrospective in nature and were performed in a diagnostic setting, thus preventing direct application of their results to a surveillance setting.

This study therefore compared the performance of non-enhanced MRI and US as a surveillance test for HCC in a prospective cohort.

Materials and Methods

PARAGRAPH

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our institution, which waived the requirement for informed consent due to the retrospective nature of the study (IRB no. 2018-0521).

SECTION

Study population

PARAGRAPH

This study was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data (Surveillance of Patients with Cirrhosis at High Risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma by MRI with Liver-Specific Contrast, PRIUS Study, ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01446666) at Asan Medical Center, an academic tertiary care center in Korea.

The study population was described in a prior study that compared the HCC detection rates of US and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI.6

Study participants were recruited between November 2011 and August 2012.

All included patients (1) were aged ≥20 years; (2) were diagnosed histologically or radiologically with cirrhosis, with an estimated annual HCC risk >5%;6,22 (3) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; and (4) had no previous history or current suspicion of HCC.

The annual HCC risk was estimated by using a model6,22 as follows: Risk Index = 1.41 (if the age is 50 years or older) + 1.65 (if the prothrombin activity is ≤75%) + 0.92 (if the platelet count is <100x103/mm3) + 0.74 (if anti-HCV or HBsAg test is positive).

The risk index >2.33 was estimated to correspond to an annual risk of developing HCC >5%.

Patients with Child-Pugh class C or estimated glomerular function rate <30 mL/min/1.76 m2 were excluded.

Patients were evaluated by 1 to 3 rounds of surveillance tests, consisting of paired US and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI performed within 7 days at 6 months intervals.

PARAGRAPH

Of the 407 patients included in the first surveillance round, 25 were excluded as they were withdrawn from the study (n = 21) or died (n = 4) without subsequent follow-up examinations.

Finally, the study cohort consisted of 382 patients who finished at least one surveillance round with reference examination (see “Reference standard” section below).

After the last surveillance round, the follow-up medical records of study participants were reviewed to document subsequent HCC occurrence.

Details of the patient recruitment process are provided (Fig. 1), and the characteristics of the included patients are summarized (Table 1).

SECTION

Imaging protocol

PARAGRAPH

MRI was performed with a 1.5-T scanner (Magnetom Avanto; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany).

Breath-hold dual gradient-echo T1-weighted images, DWI with a respiratory-triggered turbo spin echo, single-shot echo planar sequence images with b-values of 0, 50, and 500 s/mm2, breath-hold half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo T2WI (repetition time/echo time, 1000 msec/154 msec), and contrast-enhanced sequences were obtained for the original study.

This heavily T2-weighted imaging protocol was chosen as it allows for better differentiation of hemangiomas or cysts from malignant lesions than does a moderate T2-weighted technique and this is a way to minimize the scan time.

PARAGRAPH

For the current study, the simulated non-enhanced MRI sets consisted of axial DWI and T2WI.

The estimated scan time for simulated non-enhanced MRI was 4.5–6 minutes.

In the absence of gait and mobility disorders in patients, the approximate time between patients’ entering and leaving the MRI room including the installation, calibration, and sequence preparation processes ranged from 25 to 35 minutes.

Detailed pulse sequence parameters of DWI and T2WI are listed (Table 2).

PARAGRAPH

US examinations in the original study were performed by four board-certified abdominal radiologists specializing in liver imaging (So Yeon Kim, So Jung Lee, Hyung Jin Won, and Jae Ho Byun) using a convex probe (SC6-1, Supersonic Imagine SA; Aixplorer, France).

The patient stay duration in the US room ranged from 15 to 20 minutes.

SECTION

Image analysis

PARAGRAPH

The non-enhanced MRI results were anonymized, shuffled in random order, and analyzed by two reviewers (Hyo Jung Park and Sang Hyun Choi, with 5 and 8 years of clinical experience in abdominal radiology, respectively) who were blinded to clinical data, pathologic results, final diagnosis, and the results of full contrast-enhanced MRI and US.

If the two reviewers were not in agreement, the images were analyzed by a third reviewer (Seung Soo Lee, with 15 years of clinical experience in abdominal radiology) to reach a consensus.

Non-enhanced MRI results were considered positive if they showed a lesion ≥1 cm with either diffusion restriction or mild to moderate T2 hyperintensity.

Lesions with T2 hyperintensity markedly higher than the liver and similar to the bile ducts and other fluid-filled structures were not regarded as positive, as these findings are suggestive of benign lesions, such as cysts and hemangiomas.23

Ancillary features favoring HCC in particular and malignancy23 available with non-enhanced MRI (fat in mass more than in the adjacent liver, nodule-in-nodule architecture, blood products in mass, subthreshold growth, fat sparing in solid mass, and iron sparing in solid mass) were also evaluated.

PARAGRAPH

Focal lesions ≥1 cm on US that met one or more of the following criteria were considered positive: (1) discrete focal mass distinguishable from the adjacent parenchyma, (2) peripheral low echoic halo, and (3) mosaic pattern.

In addition, (4) definite tumor thrombi visible on US were regarded as positive.

Results of US were those of the original study.6

Radiologists who performed and interpreted US results were blinded to the results of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI during the same surveillance rounds.6

SECTION

Reference standards

PARAGRAPH

All the included patients underwent reference standard tests (histologic and/or CT examination) and/or subsequent surveillance round(s) after 6 months.

The results of reference standard tests were reviewed by one of the authors (Hye Young Jang, with 8 years of clinical experience of abdominal imaging), who was not involved in imaging analysis.

PARAGRAPH

As in the original study6 and according to current practice guidelines,24,25 a diagnosis of HCC was confirmed based on the results of histologic examination and/or typical CT features (nodules >1 cm with arterial hypervascularity and portal/delayed-phase washout).

Lesions considered positive on US or MRI and that fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of HCC on reference standard tests were regarded as true positives.

Patients without lesions on the first round of US or MRI and on subsequent surveillance round(s) and/or reference standard tests were regarded as true negatives.

Patients with HCC diagnosed by reference standard tests but not classified as positive by US or MRI were regarded as false-negatives.

Lesions positive on the first round of US or MRI were considered false-positive if (1) matched lesions were not observed or (2) these lesions did not show significant changes in size and imaging characteristics on subsequent gadoxetic acid enhanced MRI 6 months later.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

The sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of non-enhanced MRI and US were calculated on a per-lesion and per-exam basis, whereas the specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated on a per-exam basis, along with their binomial 95% confidence intervals (CI).

To analyze per-exam and per-lesion results in patients, the diagnostic performance measures were evaluated using a generalized estimating equation to accommodate clustered data.

MRI characteristics of HCCs were evaluated, as were false-negative and false-positive results.

P values <0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.

All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

Results

SECTION

Study subjects and characteristics of diagnosed HCC

PARAGRAPH

The median age of the 382 included patients was 56.4 years (Table 1).

Underlying liver diseases included hepatitis B in 276 patients (72.3%), alcohol-induced liver disease in 46 (12.0%), and hepatitis C in 34 (8.9%).

The median body mass index was 24.6 kg/m2.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 48 HCCs were diagnosed in 43 patients (11.3%), including 39 patients with single HCCs, three each with two HCCs, and one with three HCCs.

Twenty patients with 21 HCCs were diagnosed pathologically by liver biopsy in ten patients, partial hepatectomy in three, and liver transplantation in seven.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT diagnosed 27 HCCs in 23 patients.

PARAGRAPH

The average size of the 48 HCCs at the time of diagnosis was 1.6 cm (range, 1.0–4.8 cm).

According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system 2, 32 patients had very early stage HCCs (i.e., single nodule <2 cm), 10 had early stage HCCs (i.e., a single lesion 2–5 cm or 2–3 lesions each <3 cm), and 1 had advanced stage HCC with portal vein invasion.

Curative treatments were performed in 29 patients (67.4%; liver transplantation in 4 patients, surgical resection in 4 patients and local ablation in 21 patients).

PARAGRAPH

In 321 patients not diagnosed as HCC, the average duration of follow-up after the last surveillance was 32.9 months (range, 1–60 months).

Most patients continued to undergo HCC surveillance afterward with biannual US examination and annual or biannual dynamic contrast-enhanced CT or MRI.

A total of 29 patients (9.0%; 29/321) were subsequently diagnosed with HCC with an average time interval of 33.3 months (range, 13–55 months).

SECTION

Diagnostic performance of each image modality

PARAGRAPH

The diagnostic performance of each imaging modality is summarized in Table 3.

Non-enhanced MRI and US had per-lesion sensitivities of 77.1% (37/48) and 25.0% (12/48), respectively, and per-exam sensitivities of 79.1% (34/43) and 27.9% (12/43), respectively.

Both the per-lesion and per-exam sensitivities of non-enhanced MRI were significantly higher than those of US (P <0.001).

Of the 48 HCCs, 11 (22.9%) were detected by both non-enhanced MRI and US, 26 (54.2%) by non-enhanced MRI alone (Fig. 2), and one (2.1%) by US alone, whereas 10 HCCs (20.8%) were not detected by either non-enhanced MRI or US.

Of the 40 HCCs <2 cm, per-lesion sensitivities of non-enhanced MRI and US were 72.5% (29/40) and 22.5% (9/40), respectively.

Of the 8 HCCs ≥2 cm, per-lesion sensitivities of non-enhanced MRI and US were 100% (8/8) and 37.5% (3/8), respectively.

The per-exam specificity was significantly higher in non-enhanced MRI (97.9%, 993/1014) than US (94.5%, 958/1014, P <0.001).

The per-exam NPV of non-enhanced MRI was 99.1% (993/1002; 95% CI, 98.5%-99.7%), higher than that of US (96.9% [958/989]; 95% CI, 95.8%-98.0%) and the per-lesion and per-exam PPVs were higher for non-enhanced MRI (56.9% [37/65]; 95% CI, 44.9%-69.0% for per-lesion and 61.8% [34/55]; 95% CI, 49.0%-74.7% for per-exam) than for US (16.7% [12/72]; 95% CI, 8.1%-25.3% for per-lesion and 17.7% [12/68]; 95% CI, 8.6%-26.7% for per-exam).

The diagnostic performances of each imaging sequence of non-enhanced MRI are summarized in Table S1 and in Supplementary information.

As for the ancillary features favoring HCC in particular and malignancy in general,23 14 lesions contained fat more than the adjacent liver, four (8.3%) among which were diagnosed with HCCs; all these lesions were also detected on DWI and T2WI.

There was no lesion showing nodule-in-nodule architecture, blood products in mass, subthreshold growth, fat sparing, or iron sparing.

SECTION

MRI characteristics of HCCs

PARAGRAPH

Of the 48 HCCs, 37 (77.1%) showed high signal intensity on either DWI or T2WI, 27 HCCs (56.3%) showed high signal intensity on both DWI and T2WI, nine HCCs (18.8%) showed hyperintensity only on DWI but not on T2WI, and one HCC (2.1%) showed hyperintensity on T2WI but not on DWI.

SECTION

Analysis of false-negative cases

PARAGRAPH

Eleven HCCs (22.9%; average size, 15.0 mm; range, 10–19 mm) did not show hyperintensity on either DWI or T2WI, and therefore were missed on non-enhanced MRI.

US missed 36 HCCs (75.0%; average size, 15.3 mm; range, 10–48 mm).

SECTION

Analysis of false-positive cases

PARAGRAPH

Among 65 non-enhanced MRI-positive lesions in 55 patients, 28 lesions (43.1%) in 21 patients (38.2%) were false-positives.

The identity of these false-positive lesions was investigated by reviewing follow-up dynamic enhanced CT, MRI, US, and/or pathologic examinations.

One patient underwent liver transplantation, and the pathologic result was liver cirrhosis without evidence of HCC.

Of the remaining 27 lesions in 20 patients, 11 were pseudolesions that did not have matched lesions on follow-up imaging, seven were regarded as confluent hepatic fibrosis, four as dysplastic nodules, two as focal inflammatory lesions, one as a signal intensity change associated with an arterioportal shunt, one as a hemangioma, and one as a complicated cyst.

Among the 21 patients with false-positive non-enhanced MRI, two patients were diagnosed with HCC at 37 and 51 months after the last surveillance.

PARAGRAPH

Among 72 US-positive lesions in 68 patients, 60 lesions (83.3%) in 56 patients (82.4%) were false-positives.

Of these, 32 lesions were pseudolesions that had no matched lesions on follow-up CT or MRI, and 19 were regarded as dysplastic nodules, four as exophytic hepatic parenchyma, two as complicated cysts, two as hemangiomas, and one as an intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.

Among these patients, five patients were diagnosed as having HCCs at 15–53 months after the last surveillance.

None of these false-positive lesions increased in size or showed changes in imaging characteristics for at least the subsequent 12 months after surveillance.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

This study demonstrated that non-enhanced MRI showed significantly better performance than US as a surveillance tool for HCC in a prospectively gathered cohort with high-risk for HCC.

The per-lesion and per-exam sensitivities of non-enhanced MRI, consisting of DWI and T2WI (77.1% [37/48] and 79.1% [34/43], respectively), were better than those of US (25.0% [12/48] and 27.9% [12/43], respectively) (P <0.001).

Per-lesion and per-exam PPVs of non-enhanced MRI (56.9% [37/65] and 61.8% [34/55], respectively) were also higher than those of US (16.7% [12/72] and 17.7% [12/68], respectively).

The estimated scan time of non-enhanced MRI was less than 6 minutes.

PARAGRAPH

The limited sensitivity of US in this study appears disappointing.

It can be explained by the fact that most of the HCCs in our study were at very early stage, making the US results in this study similar to those of previous studies,4-6 as tumor size is an important factor in detecting lesions on US.26

Furthermore, the sensitivity of US may be particularly impaired in patients at higher risk of HCC, including those with advanced liver cirrhosis, because of the progressive distortion and heterogeneity of the hepatic parenchyma.26-29

Also, exclusion of patients with very early or early stage HCC in the preceding surveillance round(s) as well as positive results only found on non-enhanced MRI during the repeated surveillance rounds might have further limited the performance of US.

The study population was mainly composed of patients with hepatitis B (72.3%) and the majority of patients had thin body habitus (median BMI = 24.6).

We conjectured that similar results could be expected in patients with other etiologies such as hepatitis C, alcohol-induced liver disease, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, when their HCC risks are similar to those of our study subjects.

The diagnostic performance of US is likely to be further decreased in overweight patients,30 while that of MRI in such patients would be relatively stable.

PARAGRAPH

The sensitivity of non-enhanced MRI in our study (77.1%–79.1%) was similar to that reported in previous studies of non-enhanced MRI, consisting of T2WI and DWI, in diagnostic settings, in which sensitivity ranged from 75.9–91.7%.18,19

The sensitivity of non-enhanced MRI in our study was slightly lower than that of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI, including full gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI in a prospective setting (86.0%)6 and abbreviated gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI (80.6–89.8%).8,9,12

In the aforementioned studies of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI, each hepatic lesion was categorized according to not only the characteristics on HBP images but those on DWI and/or T2WI,6,8,9 suggesting the importance of T2WI and/or DWI in these studies.

These findings are consistent with results showing that diffusion restriction and mild to moderate T2 hyperintensity are ancillary imaging features favoring malignancy.1

PARAGRAPH

Recent meta-analyses reported that the specificity of US for diagnosing HCC was 91–94%,4,5 in agreement with the results of the present, which found that US had specificities of 94.5%.

It was significantly lower than that of non-enhanced MRI which was 97.9% (P <0.001).

However, we found that the PPVs of US were very low, ranging from 16.7% to 17.7%, indicating that a significant fraction of the lesions detected by US were false-positives (83.3%).

Unnecessary diagnostic testing is unavoidably performed on patients with false-positive surveillance results, resulting in potential physical, psychological, and financial costs.5

PARAGRAPH

Successful use of MRI for surveillance requires simplification of the scanning method and the evaluation of only essential image sequences, thereby maximizing its efficacy while minimizing surveillance time and cost.

The estimated scan time for DWI and T2WI in our study was less than 6 minutes.

However, it is worth noting that the patient stay duration of MRI was approximated 25–35 minutes which was longer than that of US, 15–25 minutes.

From a viewpoint of utilizing medical resources, not only scan time but also total room occupancy time need to be considered.

This study demonstrated that DWI can be powerful in detecting HCC with a clinically acceptable range of sensitivity.

DWI previously showed excellent performance in detecting HCC.11,20,21

T2WI should be included in surveillance MRI, as it is essential to exclude common benign lesions, such as hemangiomas or cysts, which can mimic HCC on DWI or other sequences.

The present study showed the potential benefit of the combination of DWI and T2WI as a practical surveillance strategy for HCC.

Another important clinical benefit of non-enhanced MRI is its non-use of contrast.

Gadolinium contrast agent has several drawbacks, including long-term retention in human tissue and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. 16,17

PARAGRAPH

This study has several limitations.

First, as it was a single-arm study in which all patients underwent paired MRI and US, we could not compare clinical outcomes or survival between the two modalities.

Improvements in survival should be the ultimate endpoint in surveillance studies.

However, considering that the goal of surveillance is to detect HCCs amenable to curative treatments that positively affect patient survival,31 the significant difference in the performance of non-enhanced MRI and US in detecting HCCs in very early or early stage may be associated with clinical outcomes afterward.

Prospective studies focusing on the survival differences in survival between patients who undergo non-enhanced MRI and those who undergo US for HCC surveillance would be invaluable in this regard.

Second, this was a retrospective analysis of data that were initially collected for a different purpose, the clinical flow did not match the findings of each imaging modality.

However, we attempted to avoid misclassification of the detected lesions by including all available follow-up data.

Third, as our study population was composed of those at high risk for HCC with an annual risk of >5%,6 our study results should be interpreted with caution.

Our study results do not suggest whether MRI is more beneficial than US for use in surveilling patients at low or intermediate risk for HCC.

In addition, false positive rates could be exaggerated, considering that imaging studies were performed as a setting of a trial which tends to suggest more aggressive policy than a real-life setting.

The incidence of pseudolesion (i.e., no matched lesions on follow-up imaging) of US was 53.3% (32/60), which was higher than that of non-enhanced MRI (39.2%, 11/28).

However, despite this rather aggressive policy, the sensitivity of US was arguably low.

We assumed that distortions of the liver parenchyma by advanced cirrhosis may have not only obscured but falsely simulated HCC at US imaging, as our study population were patients at particularly high-risk of HCC.

Fourth, it should be noted that non-enhanced MRI was reviewed by two readers and in consensus for research purpose, while US interpretations were from the initial interpretation of the original study.

Therefore, a direct comparison between the two imaging modalities may be unwarranted.

Lastly, this study did not compare the cost- and time-effectiveness of the image modalities, issues important in clinical practice.

However, a recent simulation study suggested that risk-stratified surveillance of HCC, including abbreviated contrast-enhanced MRI in high- and intermediate-risk patients, is cost-effective and can outperform biannual US.32

Because the examination time is shorter in non-enhanced than in enhanced MRI and contrast agent-related costs are absent, the cost-effectiveness of non-enhanced MRI should be better than that of abbreviated contrast-enhanced MRI.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, this study showed that non-enhanced MRI, consisting of DWI and T2WI, was more sensitive and had a lower NPV than US in surveillance for HCC.

The high performance and short scan time suggest that non-enhanced MRI may be a promising option for HCC surveillance in patients at high risk of developing HCC.
