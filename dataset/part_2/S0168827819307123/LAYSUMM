TITLE

Non-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging as a Surveillance Tool for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Comparison with Ultrasound

PARAGRAPH

Recently revised international guidelines for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) suggest that selected patients with inadequate surveillance on ultrasonography be assessed by alternative imaging modalities such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Herein, we show that MRI without contrast agents performed significantly better than ultrasonography for HCC surveillance in high-risk patients.

Given this good performance, as well as short scan times and the lack of contrast agent-associated risks, non-enhanced MRI is a promising option for HCC surveillance in high-risk patients.
