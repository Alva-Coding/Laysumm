TITLE

TLR9 signalling in HCV-associated atypical memory B cells triggers Th1 and rheumatoid factor autoantibody responses

PARAGRAPH

B cells are best known for their capacity to produce antibodies, which often play a deleterious role in the development of autoimmune diseases.

During chronic hepatitis C, self-reactive B cells proliferate and can be responsible for autoimmune symptoms (arthritis, purpura, neuropathy, renal disease) and/or lymphoma.

Direct-acting antiviral therapy clears the hepatitis C virus and eliminates deleterious B cells.
