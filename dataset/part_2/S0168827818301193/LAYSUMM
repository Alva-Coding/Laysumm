TITLE

O-GlcNAcylation of RACK1 promotes hepatocellular carcinogenesis

PARAGRAPH

O-GlcNAcylation of ribosomal receptor for activated C-kinase 1 at the amino acid serine122 promotes its stability, ribosome localization and interaction with the protein kinase, PKCÎ²II, thus driving the translation of oncogenes and tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Increased O-GlcNAcylation of ribosomal receptor for activated C-kinase 1 is positively correlated with tumor growth, metastasis and recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
