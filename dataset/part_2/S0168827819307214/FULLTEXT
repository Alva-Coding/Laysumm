TITLE

Clinical validation of the FLIP algorithm and the SAF score in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

SECTION

INTRODUCTION

PARAGRAPH

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition characterized by excessive hepatic fat accumulation in the absence of any secondary causes and encompasses a continuous spectrum of histological lesions, leading to a great variability in the natural course of the disease [1].

For instance steatohepatitis (NASH), which associates steatosis, liver cell injury and inflammation, is associated with progression to cirrhosis and its complications, contrary to isolated steatosis [2].

However, the intensity of liver cell injury or inflammation may modulate the risk of disease progression [3-6].

The precise identification of the histological lesions and of the corresponding grade and stage of the disease is therefore crucial for diagnosis and prognostic prediction.

PARAGRAPH

Over the past two decades, several histological classifications have been introduced [1, 7, 8] and some are in widespread use, despite significant drawbacks including lack of testing for reproducibility, or external validity, composite scores made of elements of unequal prognostic value or equally weighted, gray zones (borderline NASH), or despite lingering misunderstandings about their use for diagnostic purposes [9].

Recently, a new histological classification was proposed by a consortium of European pathologists who revisited and redefined the scoring system based on elementary histological lesions, and introduced a diagnostic histological algorithm [the fatty liver inhibition of progression (FLIP) algorithm], and a composite scoring system [the steatosis, activity and fibrosis (SAF) score] [10].

This classification was built from a cohort of morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery [10] and its reproducibility was formally tested in a small cohort of non-obese patients with NAFLD [11].

It provided an incremental increase in reliability and reproducibility over existing criteria [11].

PARAGRAPH

By nature, all histological classifications are based on morphological features, seen under the microscope, that are in fact a pathology-based phenotype developed by the liver in response to injury.

Whether these classifications truly correlate with a distinct clinical subtype and, as such, whether they carry any prognostic value remains to be determined.

NAFLD is linked epidemiologically and, to a large part, causally to the metabolic syndrome and to insulin resistance.

To be more than a mere morphological descriptor, a histological classification should identify diagnostic categories or a scoring system that are associated with distinct clinical disease states or with degrees of severity of clinical and biological abnormalities.

No such data is yet available for the FLIP/SAF classification.

PARAGRAPH

We here investigated whether different histological categories according to the FLIP algorithm and the SAF score reflect distinct patient profiles and are associated with relevant clinical and biological features, in a heterogeneous, real-life cohort of patients referred to a liver center for suspected NAFLD.

To further confirm the clinical relevance of the FLIP algorithm and the SAF score, additional analyses were performed by adding a second independent cohort of patients from a previous multicentric phase 2 therapeutic trial on NASH.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

SECTION

Patients

PARAGRAPH

We selected 140 consecutive patients (Cohort 1) referred to the Hepatogastroenterology Department of the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France, who underwent liver biopsy between January 2008 and June 2012 for suspicion of NAFLD, based on the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors with or without a discernible bright liver pattern on ultrasound.

Patients with chronic liver diseases secondary to other etiologies were excluded (drug-induced hepatotoxicity, chronic hepatitis B or C, genetic hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, α1-antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson’s disease, etc.).

Patients with significant alcohol consumption (higher than 30 g per day for men and 20 g per day for women) and those exposed to drugs that can induce secondary NASH (corticosteroids, amiodarone, tamoxifen) were excluded.

PARAGRAPH

Central obesity was defined as waist circumference (WC) ≥80 cm in women and ≥94 cm in men or a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2; impaired fasting glucose (IFG) was defined as a fasting glycemia ≥5.6 mmol/l and <7 mmol/l or a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥6.0% and <6.5%; diabetes mellitus (DM) was defined as a fasting glycemia ≥7 mmol/l or an HbA1c ≥6.5% or use of anti-diabetic treatment; high blood pressure was defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥130 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure ≥85 mmHg or use of anti-hypertensive treatment; hypertriglyceridemia was defined as triglycerides ≥1.7 mmol/l or hypolipidemic drugs; low high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was defined as HDL cholesterol <1.03 mmol/l in men and <1.29 in women or use of hypolipidemic drugs.

Metabolic syndrome was defined according to international diabetes federation (IDF) criteria [12].

Insulin resistance was estimated by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR).

The upper limit of normal (ULN) for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was gender specific and defined according to Prati’s criteria [13].

PARAGRAPH

In addition, we selected 78 additional patients enrolled in a multicentric, international, European, randomized controlled trial of ASP9831, a phosphodiesterase type IV inhibitor, who had non-cirrhotic NASH confirmed on liver biopsy (Validation Cohort 2).

Further details on inclusion and exclusion criteria of this cohort of patients are available in [14].

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

Liver biopsies from both cohorts were adequate in terms of length, absence of fragmentation and quality of staining.

Liver biopsies were routinely formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded; Hematoxylin & Eosin and Picrosirius Hemalun staining were available for each case.

All liver biopsies were re-assessed according to the FLIP algorithm and the SAF score [10] by a single expert liver pathologist (P.B.), blinded to clinical data.

This new histological classification has been validated for intra-observer variability as well as interobserver variability both among expert and specialized pathologists [11].

Informed consent for biopsies and trial participation was obtained from all patients and approved by Local Ethics Committee of the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital.

PARAGRAPH

The FLIP algorithm classifies as either NASH, NAFL (non-NASH NAFLD) or non-NAFLD, based on the presence and semi-quantification of 3 elementary features, steatosis, clarification/ballooning of hepatocytes and lobular inflammation.

Steatosis was assessed by the percentage of hepatocytes containing large and medium-sized intracytoplasmic lipid droplets, on a scale of 0 to 3 (0: <5%; 1: 5%-33%, 2: 34%-66%, 3: >67%).

Clarification/ballooning of hepatocytes was graded from 0 to 2 (0: normal hepatocytes; 1: presence of clusters of hepatocytes with a rounded shape and pale cytoplasm, but normal size; 2, as for grade 1, but with at least one enlarged ballooned hepatocyte).

Lobular inflammation was defined as a focus of two or more inflammatory cells within the lobule organized either as microgranulomas or located within the sinusoids.

Foci were counted at 20 X magnification (grade 0: none; 1: < 2 foci per lobule; 2: >2 foci per lobule).

The FLIP algorithm uses steatosis as the entry criteria into the algorithm, weighted by hepatocellular ballooning and lobular inflammation.

All cases with <5% steatosis were labeled as non-NAFLD, whereas all cases presenting with at least grade 1 of each of the three features (steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation), and a compatible overall pattern of liver injury, were classified as NASH.

The remaining cases were diagnosed as NAFL (NAFLD without NASH).

PARAGRAPH

For each biopsy a SAF score summarizing the main histological lesions was defined.

This scoring system separately assesses the grade of steatosis (S, from S0 to S3 according to the previously defined thresholds of steatosis amount), the grade of activity (A from A0 to A4 by addition of grades of ballooning and lobular inflammation, each graded from 0 to 2 as defined before) and the stage of fibrosis (F from F0 to F4), the latter according to NASH-CRN staging system, with the single modification of pooling the three substages (1a, 1b and 1c) into a single F1 score.

Compared to the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS), the SAF activity score exclude steatosis and equally weighted ballooning and lobular inflammation with a more accurate definition of ballooning grades.

Finally, histologically severe disease was defined as the presence of activity A≥3 and/or fibrosis F≥3.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Quantitative variables were expressed as means (±SD) or medians [IQR], as appropriate, and categorical variables as frequency and percentage.

Numerical variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.

Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests were used for qualitative data when appropriate.

Two-sided p-values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Continuous and ordinal variables were correlated by Spearman test.

Two separate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the variables independently associated with (1) presence of NASH according to the FLIP diagnostic algorithm and (2) presence of histologically severe disease according to the SAF scoring system (A≥3 and/or F≥3).

Variables significant at univariate analyses were entered in a multivariate analysis, whenever appropriate and/or clinically relevant.

Odds ratios were estimated from the models and were given with their 95% confidence intervals (CI).

PARAGRAPH

Firstly, we conducted the analyses on the 140 patients from cohort 1.

Subsequently we performed additional analyses after pooling patients from cohort 1 and cohort 2.

The analyses were not performed separately in the second cohort because this cohort included only NASH patients (patients without steatohepatitis were not eligible for the therapeutic trial).

PARAGRAPH

Statistical tests were performed using SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Ill, USA).

RESULTS

SECTION

Overall characteristics of the study population

PARAGRAPH

Table 1 shows the overall clinical and biochemical features of the study population.

Both cohorts are typical of NAFLD/NASH patients seen in tertiary care centers.

Cohort 1 had a high prevalence of metabolic risk factors: 84% had central obesity, 68% had altered glucose homeostasis (IFG or DM) and 69% qualified for the metabolic syndrome.

Most patients had increased ALT.

Half of the patients were treated with antidiabetic or lipid-lowering agents.

Women were older (59 [54-64] vs. 54 [46-63] years; p=0.036), had a higher prevalence of central obesity (92% vs. 79%; p=0.038), DM (60% vs. 43%, p=0.040), and increased ALT (ALT>ULN 97% vs. 86%, p=0.036; ALT≥2ULN 67% vs. 48%, p=0.024) than men.

PARAGRAPH

Patients from the multicentric Cohort 2 were younger (median age 46 years) than those from Cohort 1, with lower prevalence of glucose abnormalities (50%) and arterial hypertension (40%).

However, their overall metabolic profile was typical of insulin resistance (as measured by the HOMA-IR), with high prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia (Table 1).

ALT levels were significantly higher in cohort 2 patients as the protocol of the therapeutic trial only allowed inclusion of patients with ALT >1.5xULN.

Patients from Cohort 2 had histologically more severe disease (58%) that those from Cohort 1 (34%) mirroring different criteria for inclusion in both Cohorts.

PARAGRAPH

Collectively these data suggests that the population studied here covers a large spectrum of adult NAFLD in terms of age, metabolic comorbidities and biochemical features of liver injury.

SECTION

FLIP algorithm/SAF score categorization

PARAGRAPH

The FLIP algorithm and the SAF score could be applied to all participants from both cohorts.

Figure 1 displays the distribution of patients according to the FLIP algorithm.

In cohort 1 (Fig. 1a), 17 (12%) patients had less than 5% steatosis (grade 0), hence they were labeled non-NAFLD.

Interestingly none of the patients with grade 0 steatosis had ballooning while three patients had mild (grade 1) lobular inflammation.

Among the 123 patients with NAFLD, 60 (49%) patients met the criteria for NASH according to the FLIP algorithm.

The remaining 63 (51%) were labeled NAFL, including 18 patients with pure steatosis and 45 with steatosis and either inflammation or ballooning.

PARAGRAPH

In cohort 2 (Fig. 1b), 75 out of 78 patients were labeled NASH.

The remaining 3 patients were classified as NAFL, all presenting both at least grade 1 steatosis and ballooning but no lobular inflammation.

Table 2 shows the overall histological findings according to the SAF scoring system.

PARAGRAPH

In cohort 1, 23 patients had moderate activity (A=2) and one third of patients had mild (A=1) and one third severe (A≥3) activity.

The activity score was strongly correlated with the diagnosis of NASH (r=0.869; p<0.001).

44 (73%) patients with NASH and no patients without NASH showed severe activity (A≥3) (p<0.001).

The significantly higher grade of activity presented by NASH patients was due to both higher degrees of ballooning (r=0.783, p<0.001) and lobular inflammation (r=0.762, p<0.001).

Accordingly, scores for ballooning and lobular inflammation were correlated (r=0.525, p<0.001): there were only 3 out of 44 patients with grade 2 ballooning and no lobular inflammation and 1 out of 25 patients with grade 2 lobular inflammation and no ballooning.

Thus, when considering the activity score, a threshold at A≥2, correctly classified NASH in 60 out of 64 patients (94%), whereas all cases with A<2 were correctly classified as having no NASH.

PARAGRAPH

In cohort 1, histologically severe disease (defined as severe activity, A≥3, and/or bridging fibrosis, F≥3) was diagnosed in 47 patients (34%), and all but one were labeled NASH.

Patients with severe disease according to SAF were almost always (98%) diagnosed as having NASH according to the FLIP algorithm.

The single patient with severe disease and without NASH was a 54-year old obese woman (BMI 41.6 kg/m2) with DM and a full-blown metabolic syndrome; her histological examination displayed an overt cirrhosis with mild lobular inflammation, without steatosis and ballooning (S0A1F4), suggesting the presence of burned-out NASH.

PARAGRAPH

Cohort 2 patients showed a higher prevalence of histologically severe disease than cohort 1 patients (58% vs. 34%, respectively, p=0.001).

The latter finding was mainly due to a higher prevalence of severe activity (A≥3 49% vs. 31%, p=0.012) which could reflect the inclusion criteria in the trial that required increased ALT above 60 IU/L.

PARAGRAPH

Collectively these findings show that no patients are left unclassified by the FLIP/SAF algorithm and that the internal coherence of this diagnostic classification is reinforced by the absence of major discrepancies between the presence of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning when classifying patients in NASH or non-NASH diagnoses.

PARAGRAPH

Clinical correlates of the histological diagnosis of steatohepatitis and of severe disease.

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

Table 3 shows the main clinical, biological and histological findings according to presence or absence of NASH by the FLIP algorithm.

PARAGRAPH

In cohort 1, the 60 patients labeled NASH had a different clinical and biological profile than those labeled non-NASH: they had a higher prevalence of central obesity (97% vs. 75%, p<0.001) and metabolic syndrome (80% vs. 60%, p=0.012), and also higher BMI, WC, fasting glycemia, insulinemia, HOMA-IR and HbA1c.

Figure 2 shows a positive linear trend between the prevalence of NASH by FLIP algorithm and either increasing BMI (Fig. 2A) and increasing HOMA-IR (Fig.2B).

Additionally patients labeled NASH also had higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ALT (Fig.2C) and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) and lower albumin and platelet count.

By multivariate logistic regression analysis (model including age, sex, central obesity, HOMA-IR≥2 and ALT≥2ULN), central obesity (p=0.039; OR, 5.36; 95%CI, 1.09-26.43), HOMA-IR≥2 (p=0.007; OR, 6.24; 95%CI, 1.66-23.38) and ALT≥2ULN (p=0.003; OR, 3.46; 95%CI, 1.50-7.94) were independently associated with the diagnosis of NASH according to the FLIP algorithm.

The exclusion from the analyses of the non-NAFLD patients did not significantly affect the results.

PARAGRAPH

After pooling cohort 1 and cohort 2 patients, patients labeled NASH by the FLIP algorithm still showed a higher prevalence of central obesity and higher BMI, WC, insulinemia, HOMA-IR, AST, ALT and GGT (Table 3 and Figure 2D, E and F).

Moreover, NASH patients presented higher triglycerides levels and lower adiponectin levels than those labeled non-NASH.

Central obesity (p=0.013; OR, 3.94; 95%CI, 1.34-11.60), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR≥4, p=0.004; OR, 3.01; 95%CI, 1.43-6.35) and markers of liver injury (ALT≥2ULN, p<0.001; OR, 10.02; 95%CI, 4.48-22.43) remained significantly associated with NASH as diagnosed by the FLIP algorithm, by multivariate analysis among pooled cohort 1 and cohort 2 patients (model including age, sex, central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, HOMA-IR≥4 and ALT≥2ULN).

SECTION

Histologically severe disease

PARAGRAPH

Table 4 shows the main clinical and biological data of patients with and without histologically severe disease according to the SAF scoring system (A≥3 and/or F≥3).

PARAGRAPH

In cohort 1, the 47 patients with severe disease were predominantly female (55% vs. 37%, p=0.034) with a significantly higher prevalence of central obesity (100% vs. 76%, p<0.001), altered glucose homeostasis (79% vs. 62%, p=0.050), DM (64% vs. 43%, p=0.026), arterial hypertension (72% vs. 54%, p=0.034) and metabolic syndrome (83%vs.61%, p=0.009).

They also had higher BMI, WC, fasting glycemia, insulinemia and HOMA-IR than patients without severe disease.

Figure 2 shows a positive linear trend between the prevalence of severe disease by SAF score and either increasing BMI (Fig. 2A) and increasing HOMA-IR (Fig.2B).

Moreover, patients with severe disease presented higher AST, ALT (Fig. 2C) and GGT and lower albumin and platelet count.

PARAGRAPH

In a multivariate logistic regression analysis (model including age, sex, WC, high blood pressure, HOMA-IR≥2, ALT≥2ULN, albumin and platelet count), independent predictors of histologically severe disease according to SAF were: female sex (p=0.021; OR, 4.25; 95%CI, 1.24-14.54), WC (p=0.021; OR, 1.05; 95%CI, 1.01-1.09), HOMA-IR≥2 (p=0.032; OR, 6.22; 95%CI, 1.17-32.90), ALT≥2ULN (p<0.001; OR, 10.09; 95%CI, 3.22-31.63) and platelet count (p=0.001; OR, 0.98; 95%CI, 0.97-0.99).

PARAGRAPH

After pooling cohort 1 and cohort 2 patients, patients with histologically severe disease according to the SAF score still showed a higher prevalence of central obesity and higher BMI, WC, insulinemia, HOMA-IR, AST, ALT, GGT and platelets (Table 4 and Figure 2D, E and F).

Moreover, these patients had higher triglycerides levels and almost significantly lower levels of adiponectin and higher levels of CK-18 than patients without severe disease.

PARAGRAPH

In the multivariate analysis among pooled cohort 1 and cohort 2 patients (model including age, sex, central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, HOMA-IR≥4, ALT≥2ULN and platelet count), central obesity (p=0.038; OR, 5.51; 95%CI, 1.10-27.69), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR≥4, p=0.003; OR, 2.73; 95%CI, 1.39-5.34), hypertriglyceridemia (p=0.034; OR, 2.04; 95%CI, 1.06-3.95), ALT≥2ULN (p<0.001; OR, 8.73; 95%CI, 3.50-21.80) and platelet count (p=0.003; OR, 0.99; 95%CI, 0.98-0.99) were significant predictors of histologically severe disease by SAF score.

PARAGRAPH

Collectively these data suggest that according to the FLIP/SAF classification and algorithm, the morphological labeling of steatohepatitits or of severe disease does indeed reflect a more severe clinical, biological and metabolic profile.

SECTION

Association between the new FLIP/SAF algorithm and hepatic fibrosis

SECTION

Steatohepatitis.

PARAGRAPH

Table 5 shows the distribution of fibrosis stages according to the FLIP algorithm categories in cohort 1.

Steatohepatitis was strongly associated with liver fibrosis.

First, there was a significant correlation between a diagnosis of NASH and the stage of fibrosis (r=0.616, p<0.001).

Patients labeled NASH had more bridging fibrosis (stages 3 or 4) than those without NASH (48% vs. 1%, p<0.001).

Conversely, patients without steatosis (non NAFLD, N=17) had either no or only mild, stage 1 fibrosis.

The only exception was the above-mentioned female patient with burned-out NASH cirrhosis.

Along the same lines, none of the NAFL patients had stage 3 or 4 fibrosis.

Finally, significant fibrosis (stage 2 or more) was seen in 73% of patients with NASH (44/60 pts), 14% of patients with NAFL (9/63) and 1% of patients with non-NAFLD (1/17 pts).

In cohort 2, bridging fibrosis was present in 18 patients (23%), all without cirrhosis (as per protocol requirements).

None of the 3 patients without NASH had bridging fibrosis.

SECTION

Relationship between activity and fibrosis

PARAGRAPH

In cohort 1 the activity score and the stage of fibrosis were highly correlated (r=0.655, p<0.001).

Indeed, 27 (57%) out of 47 patients with severe disease had both A≥3 and F≥3.

Among the 17 patients with A≥3 but F<3, only a single patient showed no fibrosis, while the others mainly displayed stage 2 fibrosis (10 patients).

Importantly, only 3 patients had bridging fibrosis without severe activity; none of them had no activity, 1 had mild activity (A=1) and 2 had moderate activity (A=2).

Interestingly, the grade of steatosis, as well, correlated with histologically severe disease (r=0.340, p<0.001; S=3 45% vs. 16%, p<0.001).

After pooling cohort 1 and cohort 2 patients, the significant relationship between NASH diagnosis and activity grade, steatosis grade and fibrosis stage were significant and unchanged.

DISCUSSION

PARAGRAPH

This study builds on previous reports that described the new SAF scoring system and tested its reproducibility among expert hepatopathologists [10, 11].

Like all histological classifications the FLIP algorithm/SAF scoring system is based on morphological descriptors; as diagnosis still largely relies on histology, these descriptors are used to define clinical entities for diagnostic purposes.

However, any histological lesions or constellation thereof, that claims to identify a disease state instead of merely representing a morphological finding, needs to be associated with a distinct clinical phenotype and possibly a distinct disease course.

The current study shows that the morphological diagnosis of steatohepatitis according to FLIP/SAF does correspond to a clinical phenotype that is distinct form that of non-NASH NAFLD.

Patients labeled as having steatohepatitis have more advanced insulin resistance, measured by HOMA-IR and fasting insulin and adiponectin, higher BMI and visceral adiposity and more frequently the metabolic syndrome than those without steatohepatitis.

They also had more pronounced signs of biochemical liver damage such as increases in serum aminotransferases.

Therefore, the features identified and grouped within the FLIP/SAF scoring system do not merely describe a morphological signature of tissue injury but have a genuine value of clinical translation.

These findings corroborates the view that NASH is a more severe disease state than non-NASH NAFLD, both hepatically (more hepatocytolysis, more inflammation and liver cell injury, more fibrosis) and systemically (higher levels of insulin resistance and associated metabolic comorbidities) [15-17].

This is particularly important since current paradigms state that patients without steatohepatitis are not candidates for pharmacotherapy and resolution of steatohepatitis is proposed as a surrogate for clinical outcomes and is used in randomized controlled trials including late phase registration trials.

The current data provide empirical evidence for the validity of these paradigms.

PARAGRAPH

This study also highlights the strong association between disease activity and accumulation of fibrotic scar.

Disease activity is a relatively new concept in NAFLD.

The NAS [8] was the first attempt to quantify liver injury in NAFLD; it is however an aggregate score that incorporates steatosis, a lesion with little prognostic value [18, 19], and that has an unequal weight distribution between hepatocyte ballooning, the defining feature of steatohepatitis, and inflammation.

The SAF scoring system describes and measures inflammation and liver cell injury independent of steatosis and fibrosis, gives equal weight to hepatocyte ballooning and hepatic inflammation and precisely defines ballooning grades on morphological and not only semi-quantitative grounds.

The current data provides further evidence for the validity of the activity concept in steatohepatitis by demonstrating: 1) a strong correlation between hepatocyte ballooning and hepatic inflammation as assessed semi-quantitatively by the SAF score, and 2) a low rate of discordance between the two lesions (absence of one coexisting with severity of the other).

Remarkably, the activity score was strongly correlated with the stage of fibrosis.

Severe activity without fibrosis was exceedingly rare: half of the patients with severe activity had advanced bridging fibrosis and almost all the others moderate fibrosis.

Most patients with severe activity had some degree of fibrosis, including half of them with advanced, bridging fibrosis.

Conversely, most patients with advanced, bridging fibrosis had severe activity, meaning that cases of advanced fibrosis without severe activity were rare.

Also, the morphological composite diagnosis of steatohepatitis was strongly associated with liver fibrosis.

While almost half of patients labeled NASH had advanced fibrosis, the latter was exceedingly rare in non-NASH patients: only one patient had what appeared to be burned-out NASH cirrhosis without steatosis or inflammation.

These data favor a unifying mechanistic hypothesis whereby steatohepatitis, through long-standing inflammatory and liver cell damage, drives fibrogenesis [20].

In support of this, longitudinal data have documented progression of fibrosis on serial liver biopsies in patients with high (>5) NAS [21].

They have also shown that progression to bridging fibrosis goes together with the development of steatohepatitis [4, 21].

Interventional studies have shown that the disappearance of steatohepatitis results in fibrosis improvement [22], thus further strengthening the link between steatohepatitis and fibrosis [23].

PARAGRAPH

Further support for steatohepatitis as a driving force behind fibrosis progression is that in our cohort, the entity called “steatofibrosis” was rare.

Although non-NASH NAFLD with only minimal fibrosis was common, since 53% of patients had stage 1 fibrosis, moderate fibrosis (stage 2) was rare (11%), and advanced fibrosis (stage 3 or 4) was found in only one patient.

That patient had cirrhosis due to burned-out NASH.

Younossi et al. also discussed the entity of “steatofibrosis” [24].

In that report, patients with steatofibrosis, defined as steatosis >5% and fibrosis of stage 2 or 3 (on a 0 to 3 scale, different form Kleiner et al. [8]), regardless of the presence of steatohepatitis, had increased liver-related mortality over the control group with no steatofibrosis.

However most patients with steatofibrosis actually had NASH (86 out of 97).

In the eleven patients with steatofibrosis but no NASH, the fibrotic severity is not reported; in particular, it is not known how many patients had advanced fibrotic disease such as bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis.

Moreover a quarter of the control group (no “steatofibrosis”) actually did not have NAFLD (<5% steatosis).

Therefore these data do not clarify the relationship between steatohepatitis and fibrosis.

PARAGRAPH

Other studies confirmed that some NAFLD patients have fibrosis without steatohepatitis[11, 25]; this seems to be more common in morbidly obese patients for reasons yet unknown[11].

However, in a large European study, the prevalence of advanced fibrosis (stages F3/F4) ranged between 0% and 2% in simple steatosis and 4% and 17% in steatosis with inflammation without ballooning.

There was a strong trend for increasing prevalence of NASH with worsening of fibrosis[25].

Therefore, the occurrence of steatofibrosis without detectable steatohepatitis appears to be rare.

Importantly, natural history studies with serial biopsies confirmed the strong association between histological disease activity and fibrosis course in NAFLD[26].

Also, data from interventional trials further suggested that pharmacologically-induced changes in activity are correlated with fibrosis changes : worsening in activity correlates with fibrosis worsening while improvement in activity is associated with fibrosis reversal [22, 27].

The reality of steatofibrosis needs to be further studied.

For future reporting we propose a more precise definition of steatofibrosis: non-NASH NAFLD with significant or advanced fibrosis (stages 2, 3 or 4 according to Kleiner, which is the fibrotic severity currently required for registrational trials and by extension for pharmacotherapy).

If NASH were irrelevant for fibrosis development or long-term prognosis, we should find a substantial proportion of patients with steatofibrosis and advanced fibrosis, despite the absence of steatohepatitis.

As explained above, this was very rare in this series, except for the well described patients with cirrhosis due to burned-out NASH [28].

This confirms the association of steatohepatitis with significant fibrosis, again confirming that with few exceptions, advanced fibrosis coexists with steatohepatitis.

PARAGRAPH

This study has several limitations.

It was conducted in a tertiary care center and a certain level of selection bias could have impacted the results.

This is particularly true for the validation multicentric Cohort 2 where the histology of screen failures was not available, hence almost all included patients had steatohepatitis.

Importantly, as the FLIP/SAF classification does not take into account portal inflammation, so the relationship between the latter and the diagnosis of steatohepatitis and the severity of liver injury could not be established.

However the aim of this report was to primarily evaluate the clinical translation of this new histological classification.

PARAGRAPH

In a broader sense these data help better identify steatohepatitis, defined histologically, as an entity with clinical relevance: a more severe form of NAFLD, associated with a higher prevalence and degree of metabolic comorbidities and associated with an almost exclusive relationship with advanced fibrosis.

This complements previous data demonstrating that activity of the disease is strongly linked to fibrosis progression or regression [21, 22].

Thus, defining patients to be treated by the presence of steatohepatitis and requiring resolution of steatohepatitis as an outcome for therapeutic trials is in line with the current understanding of the model of natural history of NAFLD.

The FLIP algorithm and SAF classification are useful tools for identifying patients at risk of disease progression.
