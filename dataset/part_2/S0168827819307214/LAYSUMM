TITLE

Clinical validation of the FLIP algorithm and the SAF score in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

PARAGRAPH

The examination of liver tissue under the microscope (histology) serves to define the type and severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease morphologically, and is also used to determine improvement in therapeutic or natural history clinical trials.

The FLIP algorithm/SAF classification is a new histological classification well validated on morphological but not clinical grounds.

Here, we demonstrate that different disease categories defined by the FLIP/SAF classification correspond to entities of different clinical and biological severity.

We also show a strong association between the activity of steatohepatitis (defined histologically) and the amount of fibrotic scar.
