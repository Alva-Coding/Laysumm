ABSTRACT

TITLE

Shp2 deletion in hepatocytes suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis driven by oncogenic β-Catenin, PIK3CA and MET

PARAGRAPH

Shp2 is an SH2-tyrosine phosphatase acting downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs).

Most recent data demonstrated a liver tumor-suppressing role for Shp2, as ablating Shp2 in hepatocytes aggravated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) induced by chemical carcinogens or Pten loss.

We further investigated the effect of Shp2 deficiency on liver tumorigenesis driven by classical oncoproteins c-Met (receptor for HGF), β-catenin and PIK3CA.

PARAGRAPH

We performed hydrodynamic tail vein injection of two pairs of plasmids expressing c-Met and ΔN90-β-catenin (MET/CAT), or c-Met and PIK3CAH1047R (MET/PIK), into WT and Shp2hep−/− mice.

We compared liver tumor loads and investigated the pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms involved using multidisciplinary approaches.

PARAGRAPH

Despite the induction of oxidative and metabolic stresses, Shp2 deletion in hepatocytes suppressed hepatocarcinogenesis driven by overexpression of oncoproteins MET/CAT or MET/PIK.

Shp2 loss inhibited proliferative signaling from c-Met, Wnt/β-catenin, Ras/Erk and PI3K/Akt pathways, but triggered cell senescence following exogenous expression of the oncogenes.

PARAGRAPH

Shp2, acting downstream of RTKs, is positively required for hepatocyte-intrinsic tumorigenic signaling from these oncoproteins, even if Shp2 deficiency induces a tumor-promoting hepatic microenvironment.

These data suggest a new and more effective therapeutic strategy for HCCs driven by oncogenic RTKs and other upstream molecules, by inhibiting Shp2 and also suppressing any tumor-enhancing stromal factors produced because of Shp2 inhibition.
