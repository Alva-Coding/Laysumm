TITLE

Management of adverse events with tailored sorafenib dosing prolongs survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients

PARAGRAPH

Sorafenib has been the standard frontline systemic treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma for over a decade.

Its tolerability is limited by different adverse events, which might lead to its permanent discontinuation in a sizeable proportion of patients.

After a careful analysis of potential confounders, we demonstrated that the physiciansâ€™ experience in managing adverse events related to sorafenib has improved over time, with longer treatment periods and less permanent discontinuation for toxicities.

More importantly, these improvements also translated into longer patient survival.

Our results have relevant repercussions in clinical practice and in the design of future clinical trials.
