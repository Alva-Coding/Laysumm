TITLE

Comparative characterization of B cells specific for HBV nucleocapsid and envelope proteins in patients with chronic hepatitis B

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Antibodies and T cells cooperate to control pathogens and present functional alterations during persistent infections.

This scenario is also present in the infection with HBV, a hepatotropic DNA virus that establishes chronic infection in the human liver and can cause pathologies (liver cirrhosis and cancer) that have increased decisively in the last decades.1

PARAGRAPH

The 2 arms of adaptive immunity are however differently regulated in chronic HBV (CHB) infection.

Despite a recently demonstrated phenotypic heterogeneity,2,3 T cells specific to the different HBV proteins (envelope, nucleocapsid, polymerase and X) are all present at limited frequencies and display functional defects in patients with CHB.2

In contrast, the HBV-specific humoral response is not homogeneously suppressed.

Antibodies specific for the major component of the virus envelope (defined as anti-HBs) are only detectable in individuals with resolved HBV infection and are produced in very low quantities in CHB infection.3–5

In contrast, antibodies specific for the protein component of the nucleocapsid (HBcAg) are not only clearly detectable both in self-limited and CHB infection, but are more abundant in the latter.6

PARAGRAPH

In addition, while HBV-specific T cells, irrespective of their specificities, always correlate with HBV control and protection,7,8 only anti-HBs antibodies have neutralizing activity while anti-HBc antibodies do not appear to possess, except in some selected cases,9 pathological or protective functions.10

The reason why the antibody responses to these 2 major components of HBV are differentially regulated remains unknown.

PARAGRAPH

The constant production of anti-HBc in patients with CHB11 has been justified by the demonstration, in mice, that the development of anti-HBc secreting plasma cells is a T cell independent-phenomenon,12 but the reason why persistent antigen presence has a different effect on HBsAg- and HBcAg-specific B cell responses is unknown.

PARAGRAPH

We and others have recently demonstrated that fluorochrome-labeled HBsAg can be used to visualize HBsAg-specific B cells, in HBsAg-vaccinated individuals and HBV-infected patients.4,5

Labeled HBsAg binds to the specific variable region of the B cell receptor (BCR) present on the surface of HBsAg-specific B cells and has allowed us4 and others5 to demonstrate that HBsAg-specific B cells in patients with CHB are not only detectable at low frequency, but present maturation defects that can be caused by continuous antigenic exposure4 or by liver-localized B cell priming.5

PARAGRAPH

The development of a similar reagent for the study of HBcAg-specific B cells, however, poses methodological problems.

The 183 amino-acid long protein defined as HBcAg constitutes the nucleocapsid of HBV.

It is comprised of 180 to 240 subunits clustered as dimers, producing spikes that are suggested to contain the major binding sites13 for anti-HBc-specific antibodies.

However, HBcAg can also bind to a conserved linear motif present in the framework region 1 complementary determining region (FR1-CDR1) junction of the variable heavy 1 (VH1) and probably VH7 chain of different immunoglobulins, thus acting as a B cell superantigen.14,15

This low-affinity interaction, demonstrated for example with immunoglobulin receptors of naïve B cells,15,16 might hamper the ability of fluorochrome-conjugated HBcAg to bind specifically to HBcAg-specific BCRs that characterize memory B cells producing anti-HBc.

PARAGRAPH

Herein, to characterize the functional and phenotypic features of HBcAg- and HBsAg-specific B cells, we first optimized our staining method and demonstrated that recombinant HBcAg labeled with 2 different fluorochromes can visualize HBcAg-specific B cells.

We then used labeled HBsAg and HBcAg to study the frequency and function of HBV-specific B cells, aiming to decipher why HBcAg-specific B cells seem to be boosted and not tolerized by persistent HBcAg.6,11,17

Results

SECTION

Direct ex vivo detection of HBcAg-specific B cells

PARAGRAPH

Fluorochrome-conjugated HBsAg can be used to detect low-frequency HBsAg-specific B cells.4,5

In order to characterize HBcAg-specific B cells, 2 batches of HBcAg (genotype A) were chemically labeled with 2 distinct fluorochromes, Dylight550 (D550) and Dylight650 (D650; Fig. 1A).

The conjugated HBcAg reagents should bind specifically to HBcAg-specific BCRs on the cell surface of memory B cells (MBCs) in HBV-infected patients, but also, with less affinity,15 to a conserved linear sequence present in the FR1-CDR1 junction of the VH1 and VH7 of BCRs of non-HBV-specific B cells.16

To test this, we stained PBMCs of patients with CHB (HBsAg+, anti-HBc+) and healthy individuals (anti-HBcneg) with different quantities of dual-labeled HBcAg and with antibodies that allowed gating on total MBCs (gating strategy in Fig. S1).

PARAGRAPH

Previously, we demonstrated that 20 µg/ml of HBsAg was an optimal concentration to detect HBsAg-specific B cells in patients with CHB, as there is minimal background in unvaccinated healthy donors4 (Fig. 1C).

However, the same concentration of HBcAg could bind to about 1% of total B cells in healthy donors (Fig. 1B).

HBcAg-baits bound only to B cells, naïve and memory, but not T cells or other CD3−CD19− lymphocytes (Fig. 1D).

PARAGRAPH

Since the affinity of HBcAg to the conserved region of the BCR was demonstrated to be minor compared to matured antigen-specific BCRs,15 we titrated the concentration of the baits to detect only double-positive HBcAg-D550+/D650+ MBCs (naïve CD21+CD27− excluded) in patients with CHB and not in healthy donors (Fig. 1E).

We found that ≤600 ng/ml of HBcAg bound to B cells in infected patients, with minimal background in healthy controls (Fig. 1E + F).

Interestingly, HBsAg-specific B cells in vaccinated individuals cannot be detected at a concentration of 600 ng/ml of HBsAg-D550/D650 (Fig. S2), suggesting that the affinity of HBcAg-BCR on B cells to HBcAg-D550/D650 is higher than the affinity of HBsAg-BCR to its corresponding reagents.

PARAGRAPH

To confirm that fluorochrome-conjugated HBcAg can visualize real HBcAg-specific B cells, HBcAg-D550+/D650+ MBCs (stained with 600 ng/ml of HBcAg-D550 and HBcAg-D650) and HBcAg-D550−/D650− MBCs from PBMCs of 3 patients with CHB were sorted and co-cultured with CD40L-expressing feeder cells to induce expansion and antibody production.

Only HBcAg-D550+/D650+ MBCs secreted anti-HBc, as measured by ELISpot (Fig. 1G).

The supernatants derived from the culture of the sorted HBcAg-D550+/D650+ MBCs were negative using an anti-HBe serological ELISA assay, showing that HBcAg-D550+/D650+ MBCs are true HBcAg-specific and not HBeAg-specific B cells (Fig. S3).

In addition, we sorted healthy donor B cells that bind HBcAg when high concentrations (20 µg/ml) of baits were used.

No anti-HBc producing B cells were detected, confirming that the low-affinity HBcAg-binding B cells were not anti-HBc producing B cells (Fig. S4).

SECTION

Frequency of HBcAg-specific B cells during HBV infection

PARAGRAPH

The frequency of HBcAg- and HBsAg-specific B cells in the peripheral blood of patients with CHB was simultaneously tested with HBcAg-D550/D650 and HBsAg-D550/D650 reagents.

Fig. 2A shows the combined frequencies of HBcAg-specific and HBsAg-specific B cells in 27 patients with CHB.

HBcAg-specific B cells are present at higher frequencies in virtually all patients (26 out of 27) and 5.3-fold higher than HBsAg-specific B cells.

In individuals with resolved HBV infection (anti-HBs+, anti-HBc+, n = 8), much lower frequencies of HBcAg-specific B cells were found in the circulation compared to patients with CHB infection (>15-fold less), and their frequency was even below that of HBsAg-specific B cells (Fig. 2B,C).

PARAGRAPH

HBcAg-specific B cell frequencies varied between different patients with CHB, ranging from to 0.03% to 1.2% of total B cells (Fig. 2A and Table 1).

The clinical and virological parameters of the analyzed patients associated with their HBsAg- and HBcAg-specific B cell frequencies are summarized in Table 1.

The median frequency of HBcAg-specific B cells was higher in patients with CHB than in patients who resolved HBV infection (anti-HBc+ patients), but it was similar in HBeAg+ and HBeAg− patients with CHB (Fig. 2C).

Like our observations in HBsAg-specific B cells,4 no statistically significant association between HBcAg-specific B cell frequency and serum levels of HBsAg, HBV-DNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was found (Fig. 2D).

PARAGRAPH

However, longitudinal analysis of HBcAg- and HBsAg-specific B cell frequencies during hepatic flares (4 patients with CHB) clearly shows that only HBcAg-specific B cells were temporarily augmented, in line with the increased detection of HBcrAg during hepatic flares (Fig. 2E).

SECTION

Comparative functional analysis of HBcAg- and HBsAg-specific B cells in patients with CHB

PARAGRAPH

High antigen dose and hepatocyte-mediated presentation are the likely cause of the reduced functionality of HBs-specific B cells present in patients with CHB.

The ability of HBc-specific B cells to mature in vitro to antibody-producing cells is however unknown, even though the presence of high titers of anti-HBc in patients with CHB suggested that these cells are functionally intact.

PARAGRAPH

To analyze this potential difference, we sorted in parallel HBcAg- and HBsAg-specific B cells from 6 patients with CHB.

Identical numbers of HBsAg- and HBcAg-specific B cells were co-cultured with CD40L-expressing fibroblasts and IL-2 and IL-21 to test their ability to mature into antibody-producing B cells (Fig. 3A).

PARAGRAPH

Fig. 3 shows the complete dichotomy of functional maturation of HBcAg-specific B cells in comparison to HBsAg-specific B cells detected in the same patients.

While, as already demonstrated, HBsAg-specific B cells were not expanding and maturing in vitro, HBcAg-specific B cells were able to mature into anti-HBc producing B cells (Fig. 3B,C).

Importantly, this dichotomy remained when antibody production was triggered with the innate immune stimulus CpG (Fig. S5).

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, these data show that a functional defect of maturation into antibody-producing B cells affects only HBsAg-specific B cells.

SECTION

HBcAg-specific B cells are phenotypically different than HBsAg-specific B cells

PARAGRAPH

Phenotypic analysis of B cells present in patients with CHB showed an increased frequency of atypical memory (AtM) B cells both in the total and, more pronounced, in the HBsAg-specific B cell population.4,5

Since HBcAg-specific B cells in patients with CHB are efficient antibody-secreting cells in contrast to the dysfunctional HBsAg-specific B cells, we studied if those drastic functional differences would be reflected in their phenotype.

PARAGRAPH

We stained PBMCs from patients with CHB, using a 13-colour antibody panel (Table S1) and analyzed the flow cytometric data with UMAP, reducing high-dimensional parameters to a 2D map by plotting cells with related phenotypes in close proximity.18

Live total MBCs (CD19+CD10−; CD21+CD27− naïve B cells excluded) and HBcAg-D550+/650+ as well as HBsAg-D550+/650+ MBCs from a total of 8 patients with CHB and 5 healthy vaccinated donors were concatenated and analyzed for the expression of markers that define MBC subsets (CD21, CD27, CD38, IgD, IgG, IgM) and their activation status (CD19, CD95, IL-10R, CD69).

UMAP analysis automatically separated plasmablasts (CD19lowCD27highCD38high), classical IgG+ and IgG− MBCs and AtM B cells (CD21−CD27−) (Fig. 4A).

PARAGRAPH

Nearly all HBcAg-specific B cells are IgG+ classical MBCs (Fig. 4B).

As described previously,4,5 only HBsAg-specific B cells from patients with CHB are enriched for AtM B cells (Fig. 4B, C, D).

HBcAg-specific B cells are mainly IgG+ whereas HBsAg-specific are more IgM+, consistent with their reduced antigen-binding affinity (Fig. 4E).

Furthermore, HBcAg-specific B cells express higher levels of the activation maker CD95 and lower levels of the regulatory receptor IL10Ralpha compared to HBsAg-specific B cells in the same patient, whereas there was no difference in the activation markers CD38 and CD69 (Fig. 4F, and data not shown).

SECTION

Gene expression differences in HBcAg- and HBsAg-specific B cells of patients with CHB

PARAGRAPH

Since HBcAg- and HBsAg-specific B cells in patients with CHB differ in frequency, phenotype and function, we aimed to get a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms by comparing their transcriptional profile.

We sorted HBcAg- and HBsAg-specific B cells in parallel from 11 patients with CHB and normal ALT, to exclude transcriptional changes caused by inflammation.

The mRNA expression levels of 589 different immune genes were analyzed within the purified cells.

PARAGRAPH

Only 34 out of 348 genes measured above the detection limit were significantly differentially expressed (Fig. 5A).

In line with their IgG+ phenotype, HBcAg-specific B cells showed higher expression of CD99,20 IL6R,21 CXCR322 and BATF,23 which controls class switch recombination, and low levels of CD24,24 all suggesting that they are committed to become plasma cells.

We also consistently detected a higher expression of TGFB1 in HBcAg-specific B cells in comparison with HBsAg-specific B cells, which is important in the control of humoral responses and IgA class switch.25

On the contrary, HBsAg-specific B cells showed a 6.6-fold higher expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM1/CD31), a transmembrane molecule that has been shown to have a role in maintaining B cell tolerance (Fig. 5B,C).26

Also NFATC1, important for B cell homeostasis and apoptosis, is upregulated in HBsAg-specific B cells.27

In accordance with their IgM+ IgD+ phenotype, HBsAg-specific B cells express high levels of BCR-signaling molecules PTK2 and SYK and, because of their augmented expression levels of TNFRSF13B (TACI), resemble marginal zone-like B cells.28

SECTION

Gene expression analysis of HBcAg- and HBsAg-specific B cells in comparison to global MBCs in patients with CHB

PARAGRAPH

To further study how HBV-specific B cells of different specificity differ from global MBCs in patients with CHB, we also purified global MBC subsets (resting memory, activated memory and atypical memory B cells based on CD21 and CD27 expression) from 7 patients with CHB and normal ALT, measuring the mRNA expression levels of the same 589 immune genes.

PARAGRAPH

The gene expression profiles of both, HBcAg- and HBsAg-specific B cells differ fundamentally from all 3 subsets of global MBCs (Fig. 6A).

From the 348 genes that were expressed above the detection limit, 176 genes were differentially expressed in HBcAg-specific and 236 genes in HBsAg-specific B cells compared to the global MBCs.

However, HBcAg- and HBsAg-specific B cells were found to be very similar, since the vast majority (166) of the differentially expressed genes were shared between the 2 HBV-specific B cell populations (Fig. 6B).

Interestingly, both types of HBV-specific B cells showed an increased expression of genes linked to recruitment of cross-presenting dendritic cells (XCL1 and CD40LG).29

Moreover, they had augmented expression of genes linked to innate immune activation (MYD88, IFNA1/13, IFNA2, IFNB1) and of molecules that support their migration and metabolic function in the hypoxic liver environment (IL7R, ARG2).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this work, we expand our ability to study humoral immunity in HBV infection by developing and testing fluorochrome-labeled HBcAg reagents.

We used them in parallel with fluorochrome-labeled HBsAg to directly quantify and visualize both HBs- and HBc-specific B cells in patients with CHB.

PARAGRAPH

The demonstrated ability of HBcAg to bind to naïve B cells15,16 has imposed some modification to the protocol used to study HBsAg-specific B cells.

We initially confirmed here that HBcAg used at concentrations identical to the ones used for HBsAg (20 µg/ml) also binds to a B cell subpopulation present in individuals serologically negative for anti-HBc.

However, we demonstrated that these HBcAg-binding B cells did not produce anti-HBc.

This superantigen like feature is shared by other capsid viral proteins like HIV gag30 and it might explain the high frequency of activated and differentiated total (non-HBV-specific) B cells observed in patients with CHB detected by phenotypic,31 functional32 and transcriptomic analysis.4,33

We then demonstrated that a substantial reduction in the concentration of fluorochrome-conjugated HBcAg (from 20 µg/ml to 600 ng/ml) allowed us to preferentially visualize HBcAg-binding B cells in anti-HBc+ individuals.

We used both HBsAg- and HBcAg-fluorochrome reagents to study in parallel HBcAg- and HBsAg-specific B cells present in patients with CHB.

We observed that HBc-specific B cells are present at a higher frequency in all analyzed patients with CHB and that sorted HBc-specific B cells, unlike HBs-specific B cells, mature into anti-HBc producing cells in vitro.

Thus, in patients with CHB, a direct relation exists between serological detection of antibodies and the quantity and function of HBV-specific B cells.

These data support previous data that have hypothesized that the lack of detection of anti-HBs in patient sera is primarily caused by a production deficit.4,5

At the same time, these results underline the ability of HBcAg and HBsAg to cause a different B cell functional program.

The ability of HBcAg to activate B cell maturation without the need of helper T cells12 is the most likely cause of their different functional profile.

Furthermore, the HBcAg quantity available for persistent stimulation is inferior to HBsAg and likely explains why HBc-specific B cells show phenotypic features of IgG+ MBCs.

Moreover, the mostly IgM+ phenotype of HBsAg-specific B cells seem to be a particularity of HBV, since HCV-envelope specific B cells comprise more class-switched than CD27  +  IgM + MBCs.34

PARAGRAPH

Empty viral particles made of envelope proteins are present in the circulation at high concentrations.35

In addition, HBsAg can be also present at the surface of hepatocytes in a form recognized by anti-HBs antibodies.36

In contrast, the quantity of HBcAg available for HBc-specific B cell interaction is lower.

Naked HBV core particles are produced and secreted by infected hepatocytes.35,37,38

However, their quantity represents a minimal fraction of all the enveloped particles (whole virions and defective particles) during HBV infection.

HBcAg localization in hepatocytes is preferentially intracellular (nuclear and cytoplasmic),39,40 while surface staining has been shown only in selected circumstances (fulminant hepatitis).9

It is therefore likely that HBcAg encounters with their specific B cells are quantitatively limited to naked core particles secreted or released from dying hepatocytes during liver necro-inflammatory events.41

This might explain why we observed an increased frequency of HBcAg-specific B cells temporally correlated with HBcrAg levels during hepatic flares.

PARAGRAPH

The demonstration that HBsAg- and HBcAg-specific B cells of patients with CHB display a difference in frequency, phenotype and functional state was somehow expected and the differences detected in their transcriptome profile confirm the discovered functional differences.

Expression of genes involved in the regulation of B cell development like CD31/PECAM126 and NFTAC127 (upregulated in HBsAg-specific B cells) or IL6R21 and CXCR322 (upregulated in HBcAg-specific B cells) confirmed the defect of maturation of HBsAg-specific B cells and the more memory-like function of HBcAg-specific B cells.

PARAGRAPH

What was instead surprising is the observation that, despite their clear differences in phenotype and function, HBcAg- and HBsAg-specific B cells were more similar among themselves than to other global MBC populations present in patients with CHB.

They both expressed genes at high levels that are not only linked with antibody production.

PARAGRAPH

In addition to augmented gene expression associated with recruitment of dendritic cells, one other interesting observation was the detection of upregulated innate immune genes in the HBV-specific B cells of patients with CHB.

It is well known that B cells can internalize BCR-linked antigens and deliver them to autophagosomes where they co-localize with TLR-942 or TLR-7.43

In addition, the ability of HBcAg to activate innate immune genes in B cells has already been observed and is not dependent on its direct interaction with TLRs, but on the ability of ssRNA (yeast, bacterial, mammalian) encapsidated in HBcAg preparations to function as TLR-7 ligands.44

PARAGRAPH

The specific upregulation of type I IFN-genes and MYD88 detected in HBV-specific B cells supports the hypothesis that HBV-specific B cells can act as the primary innate immune sensor of HBV.44

They might be the specific cell population that, through internalization of mature/immature virions or naked core particles with their specific BCR, can sense HBV-DNA or -RNA content.

PARAGRAPH

Our study suffers from some limitations that may have impacted on the results obtained.

In particular, HBV-specific B cells were sorted differently than global B cells since antigen-specific B cell sorting requires the specific binding of HBsAg and HBcAg reagents to the BCR on B cells.

In contrast, sorting of global MBC populations, irrespective of their antigen-specificity, can be performed by staining B cells with antibodies specific for different surface markers.

Even though staining with fluorochrome-conjugated HBcAg and HBsAg and subsequent B cell manipulation were carefully performed, maintaining B cells on ice, we cannot exclude that antigen binding to BCR could directly activate some innate immune genes.

This alternative explanation for the activation of innate genes in HBV-specific B cells of patients with CHB needs to be carefully examined in future studies.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, the present study allows us to confirm that the B cell response against HBsAg and HBcAg is different during CHB infection.

We clearly observed that the different quantity of anti-HBs and anti-HBc-specific antibodies in CHB infection is directly linked with a different functional profile of HBcAg- and HBsAg-specific B cells.

However, the transcriptomic analysis performed in highly purified populations of HBV-specific B cells sorted from patients with CHB suggests a role that goes beyond the production of antibodies, opening new and exciting possibilities to better understand the full function of B cells in HBV pathogenesis.
