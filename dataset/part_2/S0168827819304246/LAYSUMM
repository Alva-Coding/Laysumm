TITLE

Comparative characterization of B cells specific for HBV nucleocapsid and envelope proteins in patients with chronic hepatitis B

PARAGRAPH

Protection of viral infection necessitates the production of antibodies that are generated by specialized cells of the immune system called B cells.

During chronic HBV infection, antibodies against the internal part of the virus (core or HBcAg) are detectable while the antibodies directed against the virus envelope (surface or HBsAg) are not present.

Here we developed a method that allows us to directly visualize ex vivo the B cells specific for these 2 viral components, highlighting their differences and similarities, and showing how 2 components of the same virus can have different impacts on the function of antiviral B cells.
