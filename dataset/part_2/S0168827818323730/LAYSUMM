TITLE

Intra-tumoral tertiary lymphoid structures are associated with a low risk of early recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma

PARAGRAPH

Tertiary lymphoid structures provide a critical microenvironment for generating anti-tumor immune responses, and are associated with improved clinical outcome in most cancers investigated.

Their role in hepatocellular carcinoma is however debated.

We show in the present study that intra-tumoral tertiary lymphoid structures are associated with a low risk of early relapse after surgical resection, suggesting that they reflect the existence of in situ, effective anti-tumor immunity.
