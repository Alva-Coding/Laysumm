TITLE

Hepatitis C virus eradication by direct-acting antiviral agents improves carotid atherosclerosis in patients with severe liver fibrosis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affected roughly 71.1 million of individuals in 2015 with an estimated global prevalence of 1.0% even if with major geographical heterogeneity.1

The clinical burden and the prognosis of HCV infection depends not only on the higher risk of liver-related complications and death, but also of the increase in extrahepatic complications.2

Consistent with these data, a recent meta-analysis highlighted that HCV-infected patients are at higher risk of extrahepatic manifestations related to immune dysregulation (mixed cryoglobulinemia, lymphoma, etc.) and metabolic dysfunction (type 2 diabetes, etc.) compared to subjects without infection.3

Notably, these epidemiological data are supported by experimental evidence, and by studies reporting a positive effect of HCV eradication by both interferon-based and direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA)-based therapies on HCV-related extrahepatic manifestations.2

PARAGRAPH

Emerging data also support a link between HCV infection and cardiovascular alterations.

HCV infection has been associated with an increased risk of both carotid4–6 and coronary7–9 atherosclerosis, myocardial injury,10 peripheral artery disease,11 cerebro- and cardiovascular events,9,12 and finally cardiovascular mortality.13,14

However, contrasting data have also been reported, and the basis of this association stems from correlative data, theoretical speculations, and inconclusive experimental evidence.15

A recent meta-analysis summarised the available evidence, overall confirming the negative impact of HCV infection on cardiovascular alterations/mortality even if in a context of high heterogeneity, suggesting that a better understanding of this potential association is still required.16

PARAGRAPH

The availability of safe and effective DAA-based regimens raised the question of whether HCV eradication can also improve cardiovascular outcomes.

The greater proportion of available data mostly arise from populations of eligible patients who underwent interferon (IFN)-based therapies.14,10,17–22

Available data suggest that viral eradication (sustained virological response [SVR]) reduces cardiovascular risk, but the study designs do not enable one to discriminate whether the beneficial effect of SVR is due to elimination of the virus, or driven by IFN, or confounded by selection bias.

To contribute to resolving this issue, we assessed the impact of SVR on carotid atherosclerosis in a cohort of patients with advanced chronic hepatitis/compensated cirrhosis due to HCV infection, who underwent DAA-based therapies, further stratifying the effect according to cardiovascular risk factors and liver disease severity.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Patients

PARAGRAPH

One hundred eighty-two consecutive patients with advanced chronic hepatitis/compensated cirrhosis due to HCV infection were prospectively recruited at three Italian referral centres in Palermo (n = 84), Naples (n = 72) and Milan (n = 26).

Patients were included if 1) they had a clinical or histological diagnosis of advanced chronic hepatitis/compensated cirrhosis due to HCV infection at the time of enrollment; 2) they underwent IFN-free, DAA-based therapy.

Advanced fibrosis (F3 fibrosis) was diagnosed by histology and/or by liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by FibroScan (≥10 to ≤12 KPa); compensated cirrhosis (F4 fibrosis) was diagnosed by histology and/or by LSM (>12 KPa), and/or by evidence of oesophageal varices.

PARAGRAPH

Exclusion criteria were: 1) advanced cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B and C); 2) hepatocellular carcinoma; 3) liver disease of different or mixed aetiology (i.e., excessive alcohol consumption, hepatitis B, autoimmune liver disease, Wilson’s disease, haemochromatosis, α1-antitrypsin deficiency); 4) alcohol intake >20 g/day during the previous year (evaluated by interview of patients on amount, frequency and type, and confirmed by at least one family member); 5) HIV infection; 6) treatment with immunosuppressive drugs and/or regular use of steatosis-inducing drugs (corticosteroids, valproic acid, tamoxifen, amiodarone); 7) previous history of ischaemic heart or cerebral disease, and 8) treatment with anti-aggregating drugs or statins; 9) active i.v. illicit drug addiction.

PARAGRAPH

Our control cohort included 76 consecutive HCV-infected patients with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, observed in 2014, studied for atherosclerosis progression, who did not undergo antiviral therapy because they were awaiting DAAs, still not available in that year in Italy.

PARAGRAPH

The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and its appendices, and with local and national laws.

Approval was obtained from the hospital’s Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

SECTION

Clinical and laboratory assessment

PARAGRAPH

Clinical and anthropometric data were collected at the time of the enrollment and 9–12 months after the end of antiviral therapy.

Body mass index (BMI) was calculated based on weight, in kilograms, and height, in meters.

Patients were classified as obese when BMI was ≥30.

The diagnosis of arterial hypertension was based on the following criteria: systolic blood pressure ≥135 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥85 mm Hg (measured three times within 30 minutes, in the sitting position and using a brachial sphygmomanometer), or use of blood-pressure-lowering agents.

The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was based on the revised criteria of the American Diabetes Association, using a value of fasting blood glucose ≥126 mg/dl on at least two occasions.23

In patients with a previous diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, current therapy with insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents was documented.

PARAGRAPH

A 12-hour overnight fasting blood sample was drawn at the time of enrollment and 9–12 months after the end of antiviral therapy to determine serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total cholesterol, plasma glucose concentration and platelet count.

SECTION

Carotid artery evaluation

PARAGRAPH

Carotid atherosclerosis was evaluated, at baseline and 9–12 months after the end of antiviral therapy, by an expert physician in a blinded fashion, using a high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography equipped with a multifrequency linear probe.

The HCV population considered as control also had ultrasonography assessment at enrollment and after 9–12 months.

The same operators who performed the baseline exam also performed the follow-up evaluation.

The carotid arteries were investigated in longitudinal projections of both the left and right side at the level of the common carotid artery, bulb and internal carotid in each patient.

The carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was measured as the difference between the first (intima lumen) interface and the second (media adventitia) interface on the far wall of the common carotid artery in a section free of plaque beginning 10 mm below their bifurcations and including the bifurcations for 10 mm.

For each subject, three measurements on both sides were performed, i.e., the anterior, lateral, and posterior projection of the near and far wall.

Maximum (outside the plaque) rather than mean values of IMT were considered, and edge detection was performed manually.

Carotid thickening was defined as an IMT ≥1 mm.

A carotid plaque was defined as focal thickening of ≥1.5 mm at the level of the common carotid artery.

PARAGRAPH

Measurement of IMT is currently used as an intermediate outcome in clinical trials.

Studies analysing reproducibility of IMT measurements reported that variability is lowest when determining the mean thickness in the common carotid artery;24 that the reproducibility of IMT measurements in the common carotid artery is reliable even in patients with increased artery wall thickness;25 and that26–28 examinations by different sonographers in multicentre studies is feasible with a good interobserver agreement.

PARAGRAPH

Regarding the clinical meaning of IMT measurements, an increased IMT is an established predictor of subsequent coronary heart disease and stroke, the two leading causes of cardiovascular death,29 also providing additional prognostic information to that of conventional risk factors.30

In this clinical context, an IMT ≥1 mm has been associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events.31,32

SECTION

Antiviral therapy

PARAGRAPH

All patients underwent DAA-based therapy.

We included only patients with advanced chronic hepatitis or compensated cirrhosis because at the time of the enrollment the Italian Agency of the Drug (AIFA) did not allow treatment of patients with a milder stage of chronic liver disease due to HCV infection.

PARAGRAPH

All patients were treated according to therapeutic schedules suggested by EASL/AISF guidelines available at the time of the enrollment.33,34

PARAGRAPH

All patients were tested at the baseline for HCV RNA (real-time PCR COBAS TaqMan HCV Test v2.0 and Roche diagnostics, S.p.A Monza, Italy) and HCV genotype (Versant HCV Genotype 2.0 Assay LIPA, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany).

HCV RNA measurements were repeated after four weeks of therapy, at the end of therapy, and 12 weeks after stopping treatment.

SVR was defined as HCV RNA undetectable after 12 weeks from the end of antiviral therapy.33

SECTION

Statistics

PARAGRAPH

Continuous variables were summarised as mean ± SD, and categorical variables as frequency and percentage.

The Student’s t test and Chi-square test were used when appropriate.

PARAGRAPH

Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between IMT considered as a continuous variable, and Δ-IMT (IMT 9–12 months after the end of antiviral therapy – IMT at baseline) with other clinical and biochemical parameters in the entire cohort of HCV-infected patients.

PARAGRAPH

Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship of IMT ≥10 mm and carotid plaques with other clinical and biochemical parameters in the entire cohort of HCV-infected patients.

In these models, the dependent variable was the presence of carotid thickening, coded as 1 = IMT ≥1 mm vs. 0 = IMT <1 mm, and of carotid plaque, coded as 1 vs. 0 = absent.

As candidate risk factors, we selected age, gender, BMI, baseline ALT, total cholesterol, blood glucose, diabetes, arterial hypertension, smoking, platelet count, cirrhosis, and Log HCV RNA.

ΔBMI, Δ blood glucose, Δ cholesterol, Δ platelet count, and Δ ALT were added in the model predicting ΔIMT.

PARAGRAPH

Variables associated with the dependent variable at univariate analysis (probability threshold, p ≤0.10) were included in the multivariate regression models.

Analyses were performed using SPSS package v.20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Results

SECTION

Patient features

PARAGRAPH

The baseline features of the 182 patients are shown (Table 1).

Fifty-six percent were males, and mean age was 63 years.

Fourteen percent of our patients had obesity, and 41.8% were hypertensive.

Diabetes was present in about 20% of patients.

Mean values for total cholesterol were within the normal range.

PARAGRAPH

Most patients (83.4%) were infected by HCV genotype 1b.

Regarding disease severity, 65.9% had compensated cirrhosis and one patient in five had platelet count <100,000/µl.

SECTION

Carotid atherosclerosis and risk factors at baseline

PARAGRAPH

Mean IMT was 0.94 ± 0.29 mm, and both carotid thickening and carotid plaques were found in 42.8% of patients.

None of the study participants had clinically relevant (i.e., ≥60%) carotid stenosis.

PARAGRAPH

Older age and lower platelet count were associated with higher IMT (p <0.10 for both), though only older age (p <0.001) remained an independent predictor at multiple linear regression analysis.

Similarly, older age and platelet (p <0.10 for both) were associated with carotid thickening, and again only older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.07; 95% CI 1.03–1.10; p <0.001) independently linked with this outcome at multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Finally, when looking at carotid plaques as the main outcome, older age, diabetes and lower platelet count (p <0.10 for all) were linked to their presence, older age (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01–1.08; p = 0.004) and lower platelet count (OR 1.00; 95% CI 1.00–1.01; p = 0.003) being confirmed as risk factors at multivariate logistic regression analysis.

SECTION

Antiviral therapy

PARAGRAPH

A total of 101 patients received ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir ± ribavirin for 12–24 weeks, 36 sofosbuvir and simeprevir ± ribavirin for 12 weeks, 33 sofosbuvir/ledipasvir ± ribavirin for 12–24 weeks, 9 sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 24 weeks, and 4 sofosbuvir and daclatasvir ± ribavirin for 12 weeks.

SECTION

Carotid atherosclerosis changes after antiviral therapy

PARAGRAPH

Mean IMT significantly decreased from baseline to 9–12 months after the end of antiviral therapy (0.94 ± 0.29 mm vs. 0.81 ± 0.27, p <0.001) (Fig. 1A).

Consistently, we observed a significant reduction in the proportion of patients with carotid thickening (42.8% vs. 17%, p <0.001) (Fig. 1B), while no differences were reported for carotid plaques (42.8% vs. 47.8%, p = 0.34) (Fig. 1C).

We also observed a significant reduction in blood glucose (103.5 ± 23.2 vs. 93.6 ± 20.1, p <0.001) and ALT (81.9 ± 49.5 vs. 22.6 ± 11.3, p <0.001) levels, and an increase in cholesterol levels (160.0 ± 29.5 vs. 173.0 ± 30.5, p <0.001) and platelet counts (153.3 ± 64.3 vs. 169.4 ± 65.8, p = 0.01), while BMI (25.6 ± 3.7 mm vs. 25.9 ± 3.9, p = 0.45) did not change.

The increase in cholesterol levels was present in both cirrhotic (157.0 ± 28.7 vs. 168.7 ± 30.5, p = 0.005) and non-cirrhotic (165.6 ± 30.3 vs. 180.2 ± 29.7, p = 0.01) patients.

The improvement in blood glucose levels was observed in patients without (95.7 ± 13.0 vs. 88.6 ± 27.2, p <0.001) and with (134.7 ± 29.0 vs. 90.7 ± 32.4, p <0.001) diabetes; some diabetic patients had reduced need for insulin and/or oral antidiabetic drugs.

PARAGRAPH

Notably, when looking at factors associated with ΔIMT, neither baseline parameters, nor changes in BMI, blood glucose, cholesterol, ALT and platelet counts were found to be significantly associated (p >0.10 for all).

Consistent with these results, the improvement in IMT and carotid thickening was largely confirmed across subgroups of patients divided according to cardiovascular risk factors and liver disease severity (Table 2).

Specifically, IMT and carotid thickening significantly improved in patients younger or older than 65 years, non-obese, smokers and non-smokers, with and without diabetes, with and without arterial hypertension, and with and without hypercholesterolaemia (Table 2).

Similar results were obtained according to liver disease severity in patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, and in those with platelet counts <100,000/µl and ≥100,000/µl (Table 2).

The only subgroup in which we observed a non-significant trend for IMT and carotid thickening improvement was the cohort of obese patients (IMT 0.94 ± 0.37 vs. 0.87 ± 0.31; p = 0.44; IMT ≥10 mm 30.7% vs. 23%; p = 0.53).

However, the strength of this analysis is limited by the small number of obese patients (n = 26).

PARAGRAPH

Notably, in the cohort of 76 HCV-infected patients with advanced fibrosis/compensated cirrhosis (mean age 64 years, males 48%, mean BMI 25.6 Kg/m2, mean cholesterol 160 mg/dl, 9.2% with diabetes, 43% with arterial hypertension, 60% smokers) who did not undergo antiviral therapy, we did not observe any significant change in IMT (0.88 ± 0.30 vs. 0.94 ± 0.40; p = 0.29).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Available evidence, even if sometimes contrasting, suggest that HCV infection is associated with cardiovascular alterations including carotid atherosclerosis,4–14 and that virological clearance, either spontaneous or mostly obtained with IFN-based regimens, may improve cardiovascular outcomes.10,17–22

In our cohort of HCV patients with severe fibrosis and, in two-thirds of cases, compensated cirrhosis, HCV eradication by DAA improved carotid atherosclerosis in terms of reduction of both IMT and carotid thickening.

Notably, when patients were stratified for cardiovascular risk factors and liver disease severity, this improvement was confirmed in all subgroups except in obese patients.

PARAGRAPH

Specifically, we found that SVR by DAA leads to reductions in IMT and in the prevalence of patients with carotid thickening at risk for cerebro-cardiovascular events,31,32 while no changes were observed in untreated patients.

To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies demonstrating a beneficial impact of virological eradication by DAA on cardiovascular alterations.

Cohort studies reporting and improvement in myocardial damage, cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality were mostly done in highly selected eligible populations who underwent IFN-based therapies.10,17–19

Consistently, it is not clear whether the observed positive effect was due to virological clearance, or if it was driven by IFN or selection bias.

Only two recent studies assessed the impact of DAA on cardiovascular outcomes.20–22

The first is a large prospective study on a cohort of patients with compensated HCV-related cirrhosis who underwent IFN or DAA-based antiviral therapies, and where SVR was associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular events.

However, this study did not split the results for type of therapeutic regimen (IFN or DAA).20,21

The second is an unpublished retrospective analysis on a large cohort of patients from the USA, where treatment with DAA compared to no treatment was associated with reduction in the incidence of both cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.22

PARAGRAPH

The present study included a cohort of HCV-infected patients, about half of them older than 65 years, with a significant prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, and where age and platelet counts – as already published6 – were major risk factors for atherosclerosis.

This picture allowed us to assess the impact of SVR on carotid atherosclerosis in patients with or without cardiometabolic alterations.

Notably, we did not identify any baseline and/or dynamic predictor of IMT improvement.

Consistent with these data we found that the beneficial impact of HCV eradication on carotid atherosclerosis was largely maintained in patients with or without cardiovascular risk factors like, diabetes, arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and smoking, the strength of these analyses sometimes being affected by the small sample size of some subgroups.

Concordantly, in the small group of obese patients, we only found a non-significant trend for carotid atherosclerosis improvement.

While a recent meta-analysis suggests that the impact of HCV on cardiovascular damage could be more pronounced in patients at higher cardiometabolic risk,16 the present study is the first that stratified the impact of HCV eradication on carotid atherosclerosis according to cardiometabolic risk factors.

PARAGRAPH

In our study, we also found that the effect of SVR on carotid atherosclerosis was maintained independently of the severity of liver damage – cirrhosis vs. advanced fibrosis and lower vs. higher platelet counts.

Concerning this topic, available results on cohorts of patients who underwent IFN-based therapies are very controversial, ranging from no impact of liver fibrosis to an improvement in cardiometabolic prognosis,35 to a more pronounced effect in patients with mild disease18 or in patients with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.20,36,37

Notably, the previously quoted retrospective analyses of a large cohort of patients from the USA, reported that DAA therapy reduced the incidence of both cardio- and cerebrovascular events in patients with cirrhosis, while reducing the risk of only cardiovascular events in patients without cirrhosis.22

Differences in baseline characteristics of patients, in the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, in the evaluated cardiovascular outcomes and in the type of antiviral regimens could explain the contrasting results.

PARAGRAPH

In the present study, we also observed that HCV eradication by DAA led to an improvement in blood glucose levels and to an increase in serum cholesterol levels.

These data support the results already reported on cohorts of patients with HCV who underwent IFN-based or DAA-based regimens,38–41 and a review looking to explain the ability of the virus to interfere with cellular glucose and lipid metabolism.42

PARAGRAPH

While reporting an improvement in IMT, we did not observe any effect of virological eradication on carotid plaques.

This issue could stem from the fact that, in a short-medium term scenario, IMT could be more sensitive than a stable plaque to changes in inflammatory and fibrogenic mediators related to HCV infection.

HCV can lead to increased cardiovascular risk by leading to insulin resistance,43 by inducing a systemic inflammatory status via natural killer and Th1-mediated responses,44 via increase in TNF-α and IL-6 levels45,46 and reduction in adiponectin levels,47 and via endothelial damage directly related to the HCV infection.48,49

However, we cannot exclude a potential effect of virological eradication on carotid plaques in a longer follow-up.

PARAGRAPH

The present study has some limitations.

Firstly, interobserver concordance of carotid atherosclerosis examinations was not assessed, this issue potentially affecting the interpretation of our results.

However, firstly, all tests were performed by expert operators following the same protocol; secondly, different relevant studies assessing carotid atherosclerosis were based on multicenter cohorts and/or on multiple operators,27,28 thirdly, different studies reported good interobserver concordance for carotid atherosclerosis assessment by ultrasound;27,28 fourthly, our group50 recently reported that interobserver agreement for carotid atherosclerosis evaluation is overall good among the groups involved in this study.

Another limitation is the lack of data on patients with mild liver fibrosis limiting the application of our data to HCV-infected individuals with advanced fibrosis/compensated cirrhosis.

This is due to the availability of DAA treatment in Italy when we started the study.

At the time, treatment with DAAs was only for patients with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.

However, we are confident of observing a similar beneficial cardiovascular effect of SVR in patients with mild liver fibrosis, as also suggested by recently presented unpublished retrospective data.22

Finally, the absence of data about major cardiovascular outcomes and long-term follow-up further limit the clinical interpretation of our results.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, in patients with advanced fibrosis/compensated cirrhosis due to HCV infection, SVR by DAA improves carotid atherosclerosis, this effect being largely confirmed after stratification for cardiovascular risk factors and for liver disease severity.

Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term clinical meaning of these data.
