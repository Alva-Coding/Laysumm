TITLE

Characterization of liver injury induced by cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors

PARAGRAPH

Immunotherapy for metastatic cancer can be complicated by immune-related adverse events in the liver.

In patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic cancer who develop immune-mediated hepatitis, liver biopsy is helpful for the diagnosis and evaluation of the severity of liver injury.

This study demonstrates the need for patient-oriented management, which could eventually avoid unnecessary systemic corticosteroid treatment.
