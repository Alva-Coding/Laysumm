TITLE

Characterization of liver injury induced by cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint inhibitors

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Immune-modulatory therapies have dramatically improved the survival of patients with metastatic tumours.1,2

During the development of cancer, the immune system becomes naturally ‘tolerant’ towards cancer cells, which are seen as part of the ‘self’.

This tolerance is maintained by immune checkpoint pathways that downregulate immune functions, permitting cancer cells to evade immune attacks.3,4

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against regulatory immune checkpoint molecules that inhibit T cell activation enhance antitumour immunity.5

Ipilimumab, a human Ig-G1 mAb, blocks cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4).6

Pembrolizumab and nivolumab, humanized IgG4 kappa and human IgG4 mAbs, respectively, block the interaction between programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and the two PD ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, by selectively binding the PD-1 receptor.7,8

Durvalumab, a human IgG1 kappa mAb, targets PD-L1.9

PARAGRAPH

By unbalancing the immune system, these new immunotherapies could result in immune-related adverse events (IRAEs), which mimic autoimmune conditions.10

The incidence of immune-related acute hepatitis of all grades is estimated to affect between 4% and 9% of patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 mAbs, and 18% of patients treated with the combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 mAbs.11,12

Liver IRAEs occur more rarely with anti-PD-1 mAbs alone, with a reported incidence of 1–4% of patients.11,13

PARAGRAPH

The presentation of anti-CTLA-4-related hepatitis remains highly heterogeneous, with symptoms ranging from a mild rise in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels to the patient's death from fulminant liver failure, and pathological reports are scarce because liver biopsies are rarely performed.12,14

As with all IRAEs induced by cancer immunotherapy, clinical guidelines are based on the discontinuation of immunotherapy and the administration of corticosteroids (1–2 mg/kg).15,16

Few data are available on liver IRAEs induced by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs,16 and management recommendations are similar to those used for patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 mAbs.

Given the implications of permanently discontinuing a potentially life-saving treatment, as well as the adverse effects of the long-term use of high doses of corticosteroids, it appears necessary to clarify the characteristics of these drug-induced liver injuries (DILI).

We propose here a comprehensive clinical and pathological description of the hepatic IRAEs associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, comparing the patterns observed with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 treatments.

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Patients

PARAGRAPH

A pharmacovigilance register was set up to focus on the adverse effects of anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy (the REISAMIC register) in 2013 at Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France.

Since the initiation of the registry, 1,425 patients have been treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

However, patients were not systematically identified and referred to a hepatologist.

To evaluate more accurately the incidence of hepatic IRAEs, the study period was limited to patients registered between August 2015 and April 2017.

All patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors for metastatic cancer who developed grade ≥3 hepatitis, according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) of the National Cancer Institute using version 4.03.

(Table S1), and were referred to the Liver Center, Centre Hépato-Biliaire at Hôpital Paul Brousse, Villejuif, France, were included in this observational study.

The severity of liver injury was also classified according to the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) 5-point scale (Table S2).

Informed consent was obtained from each patient included in the study.

The study protocol conforms to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki as reflected in a priori approval by the institution’s human research committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes – VII - Hôpital Ambroise Paré 9 AV Charles De Gaulle 92100 BOULOGNE BILLANCOURT).

PARAGRAPH

Clinical characteristics that included age, gender, past medical history, risk factors for liver disease, concomitant medications, and clinical symptoms, were recorded.

Biological data, such as AST (normal range, 5–55 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT; normal range, 5–55 IU/L), total bilirubin (normal range, <17 μmol/L), alkaline phosphatase (Alk P; normal range, 30–100 IU/L), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT; normal range, 10–45 IU/L), white blood cell count (normal range, 4.00–10.00 × 109/L), haemoglobin (normal range, 13–17 g/dL), platelet count (normal range, 150–400 × 109/L), prothrombin level (normal range, >70%), international normalized ratio (INR), and renal function were also recorded.

Blood tests were performed per protocol before each immunotherapy injection.

All the patients included had a consultation with an expert hepatologist and underwent a comprehensive work-up that included anti-tissue Abs [antinuclear Ab (ANA); anti-smooth muscles Ab (ASMA), anti-mitochondrial Ab (AMA) anti-liver-kidney microsomal Ab (anti-LKM), anti-liver cytosol type1 Ab (anti-LC1), and anti-soluble liver antigen/liver pancreas antigen Ab (anti-SLA/lP)], immunoglobulin G (IgG), measured at admission, serological tests for hepatitis A (HAV), B (HBV), C (HCV), and E (HEV), and viral load of cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2, human herpes virus (HHV) 6 and 8, and HEV.

Caeruloplasmin, serum copper concentrations, serum iron concentrations, transferrin saturation levels, serum ferritin levels, and urinary toxic substances were determined, and urine and blood cultures tested.

The causal relationship between the immunotherapy and hepatic IRAEs was assessed using the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM).

The interpretation of the final score is as follows: <0, drug is ‘excluded’ as a cause; 1–2, ‘unlikely’; 3–5, ‘possible’; 6–8, ‘probable’; and >8, ‘highly probable’.

SECTION

Immune checkpoint therapies

PARAGRAPH

The patients received different immunotherapy regimens: (1) a combination of anti-PD-1 nivolumab 3 mg/kg + anti-CTLA-4 ipilimumab 1 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks (four courses) followed by nivolumab 3 g/kg every 2 weeks; (2) anti-CTLA-4 ipilimumab 10 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for four infusions; (3) anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments (nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks; (4) pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg or a flat dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks; and (5) durvalumab 20 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks.

PARAGRAPH

Between August 2015 and April 2017, 536 patients were treated, 413 with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs, 105 with anti-CTLA-4 mAbs, and 18 with a combination of anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 mAbs.

Of these patients, 19 developed grade ≥3 hepatitis according to the CTCAE system [AST/ALT and/or GGT/Alk P more than five times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or total bilirubin more than three times ULN].

Only three patients were excluded.

The first was excluded because of a diagnosis of HEV-associated acute hepatitis.

This patient underwent anti-PD-1 therapy for Hodgkin’s lymphoma and presented with acute hepatitis 61 weeks after the initiation of immunotherapy.

The course was rapidly and spontaneously favourable and immunotherapy could be reintroduced.

The second patient was excluded because of tumour infiltration at histology and the third patient because the liver biopsy was not performed due to the extent of liver metastases.

Among the 16 patients included in the study, eight were treated with anti-PD-1 mAbs and one with anti-PD-L1 mAbs (9/413, 2%).

A total of seven patients (7/123, 6%) received an anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab), including three patients (3/105, 3%) on monotherapy and four patients (4/18, 22%) in combination with nivolumab.

Patients who received a combination of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 mAbs were included in the anti-CTLA-4 group for common clinical and histological findings (Fig. 1).

SECTION

Histological evaluation

PARAGRAPH

All patients underwent a liver biopsy.

As a result of deteriorating liver tests despite corticosteroid treatment, a paired biopsy was performed in one patient (Patient 5) with an interval of 16 days.

Except for one biopsy that was fixed in formaldehyde (from Patient 4), all liver biopsies were fixed in alcohol, formaldehyde, and acetic acid (AFA) and paraffin embedded.

Sections (4 μm) were then stained with haematoxylin-eosin-saffron, Picrosirius Red, and Perls’ stain.

PARAGRAPH

The biopsies were reviewed by a single hepatic expert focusing on the following features: portal fibrosis according to the METAVIR classification (F0–F4), portal inflammation (0–3), interface hepatitis according to the METAVIR classification (0–3), lobular inflammation (0–3), type of inflammatory infiltrates, lobular necrosis (spotty or confluent, with percentage and distribution), and steatosis (percentage).

A principal pattern of liver injury was defined for each patient.

PARAGRAPH

Immunostaining for CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3, ETS-related antigen (ERG), PD1, and PDL-1 was performed in an automatic immunostainer (Bond III, LEICA, 92737 Nanterre, France) on de-paraffinised sections of the 16 biopsies.

The antibodies, clones, dilutions, and sources are listed in Table S3.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Continuous variables were expressed by medians and ranges, whereas categorical variables were expressed by the number of patients and percentages.

Parametric and nonparametric tests were performed when appropriate.

The Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous variables.

The Chi-squared test with Fisher’s correction was used for categorical variables.

A p value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0.

Results

SECTION

Clinical characteristics

PARAGRAPH

In the 16 patients with histologically proven immune-related hepatitis, the median age was 63 (range, 33–84) years and nine were female (56%).

One patient had previous risk factors for liver disease consecutive to metabolic syndrome.

Two patients had hepatic tumour metastases at the initiation of immune checkpoint inhibitors.

According to the RUCAM scale, the relationship between acute hepatitis and immune checkpoint inhibitors was classified as highly probable in 14 patients (87.5%) because all the other causes of hepatitis were excluded and the advanced pharmacovigilance survey did not identify any other medications or drugs with potential hepatic toxicity.

The relationship was classified as probable in two patients (12.5%).

PARAGRAPH

Overall population and single patient characteristics are detailed in Tables 1 and 2.

Overall, five patients (31%) (Patients 5, 6, 7, 12, and 14) had previously been exposed to another immunotherapy, either anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 mAbs.

In particular, three patients with acute liver injury after receiving anti-CTLA-4 mAbs had previously received an anti-PD-1 mAb with an interval of 4 weeks between the two treatments, whereas two patients treated with anti-PD-1 mAbs had previously received an anti-CTLA-4 mAb with an interval of 3 and 7 months between the two treatments, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

Hepatitis occurred after a median duration of 5 (range, 1–49) weeks post therapy initiation, and after a median of two (range, 1–36) doses; six patients received only one dose, among whom three received a combination of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 mAbs and three had an anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 mAb.

Overall, six patients (38%) experienced fever at the onset of hepatitis, five receiving anti-CTL-4 alone or in combination with anti-PD-1, and one receiving anti-PD-1 mAbs.

A concomitant cutaneous diffuse maculopapular rash was observed in five patients (31%): three taking anti-CTLA-4 mAbs (two monotherapy and one taking the combination with anti-PD-1) and two taking anti-PD-1 mAbs.

Only four patients (25%) remained strictly asymptomatic and liver test impairment was found during a per-protocol routine blood test.

Previous extrahepatic IRAEs were identified in six patients (38%), including one with a granulomatous pneumonitis, which had been resolved with corticosteroids (Patient 11), one with hypophysitis (Patient 12), two with hyperthyroiditis (Patients 3 and 9), two with pancreatitis (Patients 14 and 16), and one with bronchitis (Patient 16).

No previous hepatic adverse events were reported.

SECTION

Laboratory test results

PARAGRAPH

Laboratory tests before immunotherapy were within the normal range for all but one patient (Patient 4) who had GGT at 104 IU/L.

Peak levels of laboratory tests included a median ALT of 460 (range, 266–3,137) IU/L, AST 437 (range, 147–2,289) IU/L, GGT 317 (range, 39–1,252) IU/L, Alk P 309 (range, 53–768) IU/L, and bilirubin 18 (range, 6–324) μmol/L (Table 1).

The R ratios were usually with a mixed profile (hepatocellular and cholestatic) at onset, the median ratio being 4 (0–26) and with a hepatocellular profile at the peak, the median ratio being 6 (1–15).

One patient had a PT nadir at 45% with an INR of 1.91 and high bilirubin, with a normal factor V value.

The PT normalized rapidly with the improvement in bilirubin levels.

In all other patients, the PT, INR, and FV values remained normal.

PARAGRAPH

Autoantibodies were either negative or present in low titres only.

ANA were present in half of patients but generally in low titre (1:80 in seven patients) with a speckled pattern, and ASMA were detected in three patients (all 1:80), but all without anti-F actin activity positivity.

The other autoantibodies tested were negative.

The median serum IgG level was within the normal range at 9 g/dl.6–18

EBV-DNA was positive in two patients (3.74 log and 3.57 log), but this was not considered to be clinically significant.

SECTION

Comparison between anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 recipients

PARAGRAPH

Patients taking anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs were older compared with those receiving anti-CTLA-4 mAbs or combination therapy [median age 69 (range, 52–84) years vs. 52 (range, 33–65) years, p = 0.029; Table 1].

Hepatitis occurred at a median of 14 (range, 2–49) weeks after initiation of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment, vs. a median of 3 (range, 1–7) weeks with anti-CTLA-4 alone or in combination with an anti-PD-1 (p = 0.019).

Most of the patients who received anti-CTLA4 mAbs presented with fever at the time of hepatitis compared with patients who received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs (p = 0.034).

A comparison of AST, ALT, GGT, Alk P, and IgG values did not reveal any statistically significant difference between patients receiving anti-CTLA-4 vs. anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs.

SECTION

Histological features

SECTION

Histological overview

PARAGRAPH

All 16 patients underwent initial liver biopsies at the diagnosis of immune-related hepatitis, which revealed active hepatitis with different degrees of severity and different histological patterns of liver parenchyma (Table 3).

Biopsies were performed within 48–120 h of the increase in liver tests.

At the time of liver biopsy, two patients were already taking corticosteroid therapy for the treatment of acute hepatitis and two other patients were taking corticosteroids 0.2 mg/kg because of non-hepatic IRAEs.

In all cases, the inflammatory infiltrates mainly comprised activated lymphocytes and histiocytes, with only very few or no plasma cells.

In one case (Patient 4), the portal inflammatory infiltrate contained numerous eosinophilic polynuclear cells, and this was the only biopsy fixed in formaldehyde.

More than half of the biopsies showed bile duct injury, with lymphocytic cholangitis and/or ductal dystrophy.

Overall, eight (50%) patients presented with mild portal fibrosis and, although one patient also had cholangiocarcinoma, this finding suggested a possible trend of acute hepatitis towards chronicity.

SECTION

Pattern of anti-CTLA-4 hepatitis

PARAGRAPH

Overall, five biopsies from patients with immune-related hepatitis because of anti-CTLA-4 showed a specific pattern of granulomatous hepatitis associated with severe lobular necrotic and inflammatory activity.

Granulomas comprising epithelioid cells without multinucleated giant cells were poorly delimited.

Fibrin deposits were associated with histiocytic infiltrate in five patients, and in two patients (Patients 5 and 7) numerous fibrin ring granulomas with central lipid vacuoles were observed (Fig. 2 A and B).

Necrosis was either spotty or confluent, and mainly seen in centrilobular areas.

Central vein endotheliitis was present in all seven patients (Fig. 2 C and D).

PARAGRAPH

The sequential paired biopsy performed in Patient 5, who underwent initial therapy with anti-PD-1 Abs for 17 months, without any liver enzyme modification and then developed acute hepatitis 7 weeks after initiating anti-CTLA-4 therapy, revealed the disappearance of fibrin ring granulomas and an evolution towards active chronic hepatitis with portal fibrosis and severe periportal activity (METAVIR equivalent: A3F1).

The interval between the withdrawal of anti-PD-1 and the beginning of anti-CTLA-4 was 1 months.

Anti-PD-1 immunostaining was negative in the initial biopsy, but some positive lymphocytes were seen in the second biopsy.

Although there was no bile duct injury on the first biopsy, lymphocytic cholangitis and ductal dystrophy appeared on the second biopsy.

However, no bile duct loss was observed.

SECTION

Pattern of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 hepatitis

PARAGRAPH

The histological pattern in the nine liver biopsies from patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents alone was more heterogeneous compared with patients who received anti-CTLA4.

Lesions of active hepatitis with spotty or confluent necrosis and mild to moderate periportal activity were not associated with granulomatous inflammation (Fig. 2E and F).

Only two of the nine biopsies showed microgranulomatous clusters, without fibrin deposit.

Portal fibrosis was present in five patients.

In Patient 11, F3 fibrosis was linked to a chronic biliary obstruction because of hilar cholangiocarcinoma.

Central vein endotheliitis was present in only two cases.

PARAGRAPH

Immunostaining revealed different proportions of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes between patients who did or did not receive anti-CTLA-4 mAbs.

In patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 mAbs, inflammatory infiltrates in portal tracts, and even more in lobules, were mainly represented by CD8 lymphocytes.

In patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs, portal infiltrates comprised CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes in equal proportions, whereas lobular infiltrates showed a slight predominance of CD8 lymphocytes.

PARAGRAPH

FOXP3-positive lymphocytes were rarely detected in liver biopsies except in samples from Patient 2, who received a combined therapy, and no difference was observed between patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 and patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 alone.

Immunostaining for ERG highlighted alterations of sinusoidal endothelial cells, particularly those in close contact with granulomas in patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 mAbs, but not in patients treated with either anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs alone.

SECTION

Management and outcomes

PARAGRAPH

The management was specific for each patient based on the clinical course and histological features.

Overall, six patients (38%) did not receive any corticosteroid therapy and experienced a spontaneous improvement in liver tests, one treated with anti-CTLA-4 mAbs and five treated with anti-PD-1 mAbs.

Patient 1 is still in complete remission, without re-introduction of immunotherapy.

Only, three patients (Patients 7, 10, and 12) were rechallenged with an anti-PD-1 mAb; one patient died of tumour progression (Patient 7); one experienced a transient recurrence of a grade 1 elevation of liver enzymes (Patient 10); and no liver recurrence of adverse events in the third patient (Patient 12).

Before the onset of acute hepatitis, two patients (Patients 3 and 11) were taking corticosteroids 0.2 mg/kg (10 mg/day) and this dose was not increased.

Two patients (Patients 6 and 9) were treated with corticosteroids 0.5 mg/kg and five patients (Patients 2, 4, 7, 8 and 15) with corticosteroids 1 mg/kg.

A total of three patients treated with corticosteroids 1 mg/kg had jaundice (bilirubin >42 μmol/L/2.5 mg/dl).

All patients treated with corticosteroids 1 mg/kg showed more severe histological damage compared with patients not treated.

In all but one patient, liver histology showed a grade 3 inflammation in at least one zone and presented with central endotheliitis.

Immunotherapy was not reintroduced in these seven patients.

Only one patient (Patient 5) with severe histological lesions required high doses of corticosteroids administered initially as boluses and then up to 2.5 mg/kg, as well as an additional immunosuppressive agent (mycophenolate mofetil).

In this patient, the corticosteroids were slowly tapered over a year to reach a maintenance dose of 5 mg/day, obtaining normalisation of liver tests.

Anticancer immunotherapy was permanently discontinued.

Two patients showed an increase in liver test results after weaning of corticosteroids, one because of hepatic metastases progression and one without defined causes and spontaneous resolution (long-term effect of the immunotherapy was hypothesised).

In patients who received corticosteroid therapy, there was a nonsignificant trend for lower interval time between immunotherapy and acute hepatitis, higher cytolysis and cholestasis, in particular higher bilirubin, compared with patients who did not receive such treatment.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

To date, there has been no large-scale review of patients with DILI resulting from the major classes of immune checkpoint inhibitor.

This study examined a comprehensive serological, chronological, and histopathological data set of patients with checkpoint inhibitor hepatotoxicity.

Despite the heterogeneous presentation of this type of DILI, patients receiving anti-CTLA4 mAbs had a similar presentation and distinct histological patterns compared with patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs.

Furthermore, we demonstrated the need for patient-oriented management, which, unlike current guidelines, could eventually avoid unnecessary systemic corticosteroid treatment.

Based on these findings, we propose an algorithm for the diagnosis and management of immune-mediated hepatitis resulting from checkpoint inhibitors (Fig. 3).

PARAGRAPH

Acute grade ≥3 hepatitis according to CTCAE system (cytolysis and/or cholestasis more than five times, bilirubin more than three times ULN) was diagnosed in only 3.5% of patients who received immunotherapy for metastatic cancer.

These data confirm the rarity of this DILI, which has been reported in 1–8% of patients during treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors.11

PARAGRAPH

Given the lack of specific biomarkers, the diagnosis of DILI remains an exclusion diagnosis.18

Of the 19 patients concerned, one was excluded from the study because of a positive viral load for HEV, which is a rare cause of acute hepatitis.19

Therefore, extensive work-up is mandatory to exclude any other cause of liver injury.

This work-up must also be highly accurate before any decision is made to administer high doses of corticosteroids, which might be futile or even harmful.20

PARAGRAPH

Three of the patients of this series who developed anti-CTLA-4-induced acute hepatitis had previously been exposed to anti-PD-1 therapy (pembrolizumab), with only a short period elapsing between receiving the two immunotherapies.

Whether the immune system activation induced by anti-PD-1 therapy had enhanced the immune response and should be considered as a risk factor for the onset of hepatitis needs to be determined.

A previous study compared sequential treatment in two cohorts.

In the first one, patients were treated by nivolumab for 3 months followed by ipilimumab and in the second cohort, the opposite.

The tolerance was better for patients first treated with ipilimumab.

Adverse events observed under front-line ipilimumab were not worsened by nivolumab, whereas low toxicity under front-line nivolumab was dramatically worsened by second-line ipilimumab.21

Overall, four patients from the current study received the combination therapy of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 mAbs.

Indeed, it has been reported that the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab is associated with a greater risk of developing high-grade hepatic IRAEs.22,23

PARAGRAPH

Important elements in this study are the histological findings.

The five patients who received anti-CTLA-4 as monotherapy or in combination with anti-PD-1 mAbs displayed a specific pattern of granulomatous hepatitis with fibrin deposition and central vein endotheliitis.

Granulomatous hepatitis had also been reported in six patients with metastatic melanoma who had received vemurafenib, a protein kinase inhibitor, and ipilimumab.24

Similar poorly formed granulomatous inflammation has been described in a patient who underwent treatment with vemurafenib alone.25

In other organs, such as the mediastinum, central nervous system, lung, or spleen, sarcoid-like granulomas have been reported with ipilimumab.26–28

PARAGRAPH

Acute hepatitis with fibrin ring granulomas was recently described in two patients treated with a combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab.29

The presence of fibrin exudates associated with the inflammatory infiltrates suggested destruction of the sinusoidal wall.

Indeed, in the current study, immunostaining for ERG demonstrated endothelial cell alterations only in the case of granulomatous hepatitis related to anti-CTLA-4 therapy.

PARAGRAPH

Another interesting finding was lobular hepatitis with necrosis that was either spotty or confluent.

This observation was in line with another study that had described lobular hepatitis and grade 3 hepatitis accompanied by lymphocytic and histiocytic infiltrates in patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 mAbs.14

PARAGRAPH

In patients who received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy, liver damage was more heterogeneous, involving lobular and periportal activity.

Microgranulomatous lesions without fibrin depositions were observed in two patients.

Only one published case report has described histological features of liver toxicity induced by anti-PD-1 mAbs, which highlighted the presence of several foci of lobular inflammation and necrosis, with mild fibrosis also being present in the centrilobular zone.30

PARAGRAPH

Immunostaining revealed that both the periportal and lobular inflammatory infiltration seen in patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 was generated by CD8 lymphocytes, in line with the results reported by Johncilla et al.14 In patients treated with anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 mAbs, the inflammatory infiltrate comprised both CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes.

Although regulatory T cells (Treg) identified by FOXP3 staining constitutionally express CTLA-4, the number of FOXP3 Treg in liver parenchyma did not differ between patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1.

PARAGRAPH

Liver injury resulting from immune checkpoint inhibitors is not typical of what is seen in autoimmune hepatitis,31 because the characteristic features of autoimmune hepatitis, such as plasma cell infiltration, severe interface hepatitis, piecemeal necrosis and rosette formation, are lacking.

Thus, it should be referred to as immune-mediated hepatitis rather than autoimmune-like hepatitis.

PARAGRAPH

In addition, the histological assessment was informative regarding the severity of liver damage, which can provide crucial elements that will drive the therapeutic decision.

This finding highlights the need for the precise grading and staging of histological features in such patients.

PARAGRAPH

Finally, our findings suggest a risk that acute hepatitis related to immune checkpoint inhibitors can rapidly evolve towards chronicity.

Of our patients, one (Patient 5) underwent two liver biopsies because of a second peak of transaminase levels during corticosteroid therapy.

The second biopsy showed the development of stage 1 fibrosis, absent from the first biopsy, and portal inflammation had deteriorated from grade 1 to 3.

PARAGRAPH

The observations of this study can challenge the present recommendations concerning the management of immune toxicity.

Indeed, spontaneous improvement in liver test results can occur following the suspension of immunotherapy without any corticosteroid administration and low doses of corticosteroids might be sufficient to control the disease.

The current recommendation for grade 3 hepatitis, according to the CTCAE system, is to introduce corticosteroid therapy at a dose of 1–2 mg/kg/day15 or 2–4 mg/kg/day.32

Patients are usually treated without a prior histological assessment.16

The decision to initiate the corticosteroid treatment, and the choice of the dose, should be based on the presence of jaundice (bilirubin >2.5 mg/dl) and/or liver failure (INR ≥1.5) and the severity of histological liver damage (activity grade of 3).

The symptoms of patients in our study without grade 3 hepatitis and no severe histological damage could be improved without corticosteroid therapy.

The addition of a second immunosuppression drug12 should be considered for patients not improving with high doses of corticosteroids.

In the event of corticosteroid intolerance, the use of anti-thymocyte globulin therapy could constitute an effective therapeutic option.33

PARAGRAPH

Whether high doses of corticosteroids impact tumour response remains unclear.34

One study demonstrated that the duration of tumour response was not affected by the use of high-dose corticosteroids to treat immune-related toxicities.35

This observation was confirmed by another study during which treatment failure and survival were no worse in patients requiring corticosteroid therapy compared with patients not treated with corticosteroids.36

By contrast, in a pooled analysis of treatment with nivolumab, patients who experienced any grade 3 or 4 toxicity had a slightly worse response rate.37

PARAGRAPH

The re-introduction of immunotherapy following an episode of acute hepatitis is still debatable.

It was shown here that, in some cases, it was possible and safe to reintroduce immunotherapy without corticosteroid therapy.

A report of two clinical cases described the re-administration of anti-PD-1 therapy together with the introduction of budesonide and ursodeoxycholic acid.31

Liver-directed topical corticosteroids could represent an interesting approach because they interfere less with the antitumour activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors, but this modality also deserves further study.

PARAGRAPH

The strengths of this study included the description of a multidisciplinary approach to this particular type of DILI, involving interplay between hepatologists, oncologists, pathologists, and immunologists.

To date, there is no comparison between anti-PD-1/PD-L1- and anti-CTLA-4-induced liver injuries.

Most of all, all subjects underwent a liver biopsy and, for each biopsy, characterisation of lymphocyte subtypes was analysed by means of an immunostaining assessment.

PARAGRAPH

The number of patients remains limited.

However, because of the considerable efficacy of immunotherapy, we assume that it will become increasingly administered in patients with metastatic cancer and, consequently, that the number of immune-related liver injuries will also increase.

PARAGRAPH

No predisposing immunological risk factors were identified that could foretell the risk of immunotherapy-induced hepatitis, which is consistent with the fact that no biomarkers have yet been identified to predict the occurrence of IRAEs in patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors.5

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, acute hepatitis resulting from cancer immunotherapy is rare, being diagnosed in only 3.5% of treated patients.

Two different histological patterns of immune-mediated hepatitis were identified: granulomatous hepatitis with fibrin deposits associated with anti-CTLA-4 mAbs, and lobular, non-granulomatous hepatitis associated with anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 mAbs.

A liver biopsy is of paramount importance because it provides information on the severity of liver injury and helps guiding the choice of therapy, which can avoid corticosteroids.

Nevertheless, management remains challenging and must be patient-oriented.

Further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms underlying liver toxicities and to identify predictive and prognostic factors.
