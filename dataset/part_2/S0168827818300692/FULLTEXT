TITLE

Intra-arterial idarubicin_lipiodol without embolisation in hepatocellular carcinoma: The LIDA-B phase I trial

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is the standard of care for unresectable intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).1

Although TACE has been widely used for several years, the procedure varies considerably across centres and interventional radiologists, especially regarding chemotherapeutic agents, doses, drug-releasing vectors, and embolisation agents.2

This heterogeneity is explained by the absence of proof to clarify the mechanism by which TACE improves patient survival.

Some clinicians believe that embolisation has a major role and that adding a chemotherapeutic agent does not improve efficacy.

Indeed, six randomised trials failed to demonstrate the superiority of TACE over bland embolisation.3–8

Others believe that the locally delivered chemotherapeutic agent has a major role and that embolisation is associated with greater harm than benefit.

Three randomised trials failed to demonstrate the superiority of TACE over chemolipiodolisation (transarterial injection of a chemotherapeutic agent emulsified with lipiodol) in patients with unresectable HCC.9–11

A large randomised study comparing three groups of patients with unresectable HCC receiving triple-drug chemolipiodolisation with (arm 1, n = 122) or without embolisation (arm 2, n = 121) or single-drug chemolipiodolisation with embolisation (arm 3, n = 122) showed significantly better survival in patients receiving triple-drug chemolipiodolisation,12 thereby highlighting the major role of the drugs in the efficacy of the procedure.

PARAGRAPH

In oncology, chemotherapeutic agents are usually administered every 2–3 weeks to limit tumour repopulation between each cycle while preserving an acceptable toxicity profile.13,14

By contrast, TACE is usually administered either every 4–8 weeks to part of the liver or ‘on demand’.15

Thus, liver tumours might receive the drug incorporated in TACE every 8–16 weeks or longer, in contrast to the previously mentioned rationale.

PARAGRAPH

Idarubicin, an anthracycline characterised by its high cytotoxicity against HCC cells,16 high hepatic extraction ratio (40% of the injected dose distributed in the liver),17 and high lipophilicity leading to stable emulsions with lipiodol,17 appears to be a suitable candidate for transarterial liver therapies.

We hypothesised that the use of idarubicin combined with lipiodol would make embolisation unnecessary, provided that idarubicin_lipiodol is administered every three weeks to limit tumour repopulation.14

PARAGRAPH

Thus, we conducted a dose-escalation phase I trial to assess the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of intra-arterial idarubicin_lipiodol emulsion administered every three weeks in patients with unresectable HCC and its impact on health-related quality of life (HrQoL).

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Study objectives

PARAGRAPH

This was a single-centre, open-label, dose-escalation phase I trial of a chemolipiodolisation regimen using idarubicin.

The trial was conducted in accordance with good clinical practice and Declaration of Helsinki guidelines.

Documented approval from the ethics committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes Est I, Dijon) and the health authorities (Agence Nationale de Sécurité des Médicaments et Produits de Santé, Saint-Denis) was obtained before the start of the study.

The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02028949).

All patients provided written informed consent before enrolment.

PARAGRAPH

The primary objective was to establish the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of idarubicin emulsified with lipiodol after two transarterial injections (day 1 and day 21) in patients with cirrhotic, unresectable, non-metastatic HCC.

Secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and PK, of idarubicin_lipiodol and its impact on patient HrQoL.

SECTION

Study population

PARAGRAPH

Patients (age ≥18 years) with HCC unsuitable for curative treatments (resection or percutaneous ablation) were evaluated for the study.

Eligibility criteria included a confirmed diagnosis of HCC according to the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) criteria;18 Child-Pugh liver function of A–B7 without ascites or jaundice; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1; platelet count >50,000/mm3; absolute neutrophil count >1,000/mm3; serum creatinine <150 µmol/L; and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >50%.

Exclusion criteria were extrahepatic metastases; lobar/main portal tumour thrombosis; known gastrointestinal bleeding up to 30 days before study entry; anticoagulant therapy; pregnancy; and allergy or any other contra-indication to anthracyclines or iodine-containing agents.

SECTION

Study design

PARAGRAPH

Treatment comprised two transarterial whole-liver injections of an emulsion combining lipiodol and idarubicin (day 1 and day 21) at one of five escalating doses: 5, 10, 15, 20, or 25 mg.

The starting dose of idarubicin for the first session (day 1) was 10 mg.

Idarubicin dose escalation followed a continual reassessment method (CRML).19,20

PARAGRAPH

The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE v4.0) was used to classify adverse events (AEs).21

The DLT was defined by the scientific committee of the trial as any unacceptable toxicity that was possibly, probably, or definitely attributed to treatment until one month after the second session.

Besides death, unacceptable toxicity was defined as any AE contraindicating a further session: any grade 4 AE (for haemoglobin level, neutrophil and platelet count, grade 4 AE was not considered a DLT if it was reversible within seven days) or in cases of any grade 3 AE of the following categories: hepatobiliary disorders (except portal hypertension, portal vein thrombosis, and ‘other’), investigations (except decreased ejection fraction), and renal and urinary disorders.

PARAGRAPH

In cases of DLT occurring within the first 20 days after the first session, the second session was performed with an idarubicin dose of 60% relative to the first one (i.e. 3, 6, 9, 12, or 15 mg).

SECTION

Idarubicin_lipiodol emulsion

PARAGRAPH

Lipiodol (Lipiodol® Ultra Fluide, Guerbet, Aulnay sous Bois, France) and idarubicin hydrochloride powder (Zavedos®, Pfizer, Paris, France) were used in their commercial forms.

Whatever the idarubicin dose, idarubicin was dissolved in water for injection to obtain a solution with a final volume of 5 ml.

This was mixed with 10 ml of lipiodol, as recommended, to obtain a final volume of emulsion of 15 ml.22

Emulsions were prepared by the interventional radiologist just before the injection using the pumping method (15 quick passages through a three-way tap from one 30 ml-syringe to another).

For the first pass, the idarubicin solution (aqueous phase) was pushed into the lipiodol (oily phase).

SECTION

Transarterial administration

PARAGRAPH

Transarterial treatment was administered through a femoral access with a 5F catheter.

The patency of the portal branches was confirmed at the venous phase of a post-contrast injection into the superior mesenteric artery.

Extrahepatic arteries feeding the tumour(s) were detected and systematically embolised by coils.

Transarterial injections were given through a 2.7F microcatheter (Progreat, Terumo, Japan) according to a standard protocol.

Emulsions were injected as fast as possible into the proper hepatic artery (in case of modal anatomy) under fluoroscopic monitoring but avoiding any reflux upstream to the tip of the catheter.

Prophylactic embolisation of the gastroduodenal artery was achieved using 4–5-mm 0.018” Nester coils (Cook, Bloomington, IN, USA) to prevent reflux if the proper hepatic artery was short.

No prophylactic embolisation was performed for the cystic or the right gastric artery.

If there were two or three hepatic arteries, the emulsion was injected in equal proportions (i.e. 50%/50% or 33%/33%/33%) into each of the different hepatic arteries.

Ondansetron was used when necessary as the antiemetic drug, and patients were discharged 72 h after the session in the absence of AE.

SECTION

Safety

PARAGRAPH

Safety (AEs and laboratory variables) was assessed using NCI-CTCAE v4.0 at baseline, every day during the hospital stay [day 1–4 (first session), day 21–24 (second session)] and at days 15, 35, and 49 (1 month after the second session, i.e. end of the study).

LVEF was measured at baseline and at day 49.

Electrocardiography (ECG) was also performed at baseline and at day 49.

SECTION

Technical success and efficacy

PARAGRAPH

Technical success was defined by the ability to deliver the full treatment to the whole liver.

It was evaluated immediately after each transarterial injection by an unenhanced computed tomography (CT) scan.

PARAGRAPH

Tumour response was evaluated at day 49 ± 7 days by liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (mRECIST) criteria.23

The objective response rate was defined as complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR).

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was measured at day 49.

After the study period, further sessions with the same regimen were allowed and left to the investigator’s choice.

Our policy for imaging follow-up was MRI examination of the liver every three months.

SECTION

Pharmacokinetics

PARAGRAPH

Peripheral blood samples were collected at baseline and at 5 min, 15 min, 2 h, and 24 h after the first session.

Idarubicin and its major metabolite idarubicinol were measured using reverse-phase liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.

The lower limit of quantification was 1 ng/ml.

PARAGRAPH

The peak concentration (Cmax) and time to peak concentration (Tmax) of idarubicin and idarubicinol were determined from the concentration-time curve for each patient.

The area under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 24 h (AUC0–24) of idarubicin and idarubicinol were calculated using the linear trapezoidal method.

SECTION

Heath-related quality of life

PARAGRAPH

HrQoL was assessed using EORTC QLQ-C3024 at baseline and at days 15, 35, and 49.

The QLQ-C30 is a cancer-specific tool comprising 30 items that generate 15 scores: one for the global health scale, five for functioning scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), and nine for symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea, and financial difficulties).

These scores vary from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) for global health and functioning scales, and from 0 (best) to 100 (worst) for symptom scales.

The minimal clinically relevant difference was defined as a difference of at least five points.25

SECTION

Statistical analyses

PARAGRAPH

We used a CRML method19,20 to design the phase I trial with the following hypotheses.

The MTD was defined as the dose at which fewer than 20% of the patients experienced a DLT; the MTD was also the recommended dose.

Cohorts of one patient were sequentially enrolled at one dose level on the basis of the DLT observed within the month after the second session of the previous patient.

CRML attributed to one patient the dose level for which the probability of toxicity was the closest to the achievable dose level (i.e. MTD).

We planned to assess idarubicin doses of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mg and assumed that 4%, 7%, 20%, 35%, and 55% of patients, respectively, would experience DLT (distribution of the relationship between dose and DLT was based on power distribution modelling).

The recommended dose was defined as the dose for which CRML would have attributed the dose level after the last 15 included patients or if nine patients had been treated at the same dose level.

PARAGRAPH

DLT and tumour response rates were described using frequencies and percentages.

Response rates were compared using Fisher’s exact test according to the dose of idarubicin.

Time to progression (TTP) was defined as the time from study inclusion to disease progression (local, regional, distant, and second cancer).

Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from study inclusion to death (all causes).

Surviving patients were censored at the last follow-up.

Median follow-up was calculated according to reverse Kaplan–Meier estimates.

TTP and OS curves were plotted using the Kaplan–Meier method, described using medians with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and compared for exploratory purposes according to the dose of idarubicin using log-rank tests.

PARAGRAPH

HrQoL scores were described using mean differences in scores with baseline as the reference and scores at one month.

The proportions of patients with deterioration (≥5-point decrease in global health and functioning scores, and ≥5-point increase in symptom scores) were also reported.

PARAGRAPH

Data analyses were performed using Stata software 12 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).

SECTION

Results

SECTION

Patients

PARAGRAPH

Between November 2012 and November 2015, 15 patients were enrolled in this phase I trial.

Their demographic and baseline clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1.

A total of 11 (73%) patients were Child-Pugh A and four (27%) were Child-Pugh B7; five (33%) patients had portal tumour thrombosis (lobar or more distal); and one, four, seven, and three patients were treated at idarubicin doses of 10, 15, 20, and 25 mg, respectively.

All patients had the two scheduled sessions except for two who experienced DLTs: one patient died 27 days after the first session, whereas the second patients presented with severe pain requiring hospitalisation at day 15, contraindicating a second session.

Except for these two patients, the follow-up was complete.

SECTION

Dose-limiting toxicities and maximum-tolerated dose

PARAGRAPH

Only two DLTs were observed during the study period (Table 2).

The first one occurred seven days after the first transarterial injection in the fourth patient (idarubicin 20 mg), who had oedematous-ascitic decompensation associated with progression of tumour thrombosis (right portal vein) up to the splenomesaraic confluence.

In the following days, the patient developed encephalopathy and gastric haemorrhage.

The patient was successfully treated and, by day 12, had recovered a good clinical health status with liver enzyme levels returning close to baseline values.

The patient was discharged for convalescence two days later (day 14).

Unfortunately, on day 21, he presented with hypoxia with an oxygen saturation of 89% and required continuous oxygen for 24 h. His health status rapidly deteriorated and he died from a pulmonary embolism on day 27.

In accordance with the CRML method, the fifth patient was treated with idarubicin 15 mg.

The second DLT occurred in the 13th patient (idarubicin 25 mg) following the first transarterial injection.

It comprised grade 3 abdominal pain refractory to immediate-release morphine and required hospitalisation on day 15.

The patient was successfully treated with a continuous infusion of nefopam and, in the absence of abnormalities on a contrast-enhanced CT scan, was discharged on day 18.

As a result of this AE, it was decided not to perform the second transarterial injection for this patient.

PARAGRAPH

Thus, the treatment-related complication rate calculated on the occurrence of DLTs was 13% (two of 15 patients), with DLT rates of 0% (0/1), 0% (0/4), 14% (1/7), and 33% (1/3) at the idarubicin 10, 15, 20, and 25 mg dose levels, respectively.

Based on the CRML method and the accumulated information, the a posteriori link between dose level and the proportion of patients experiencing DLT was: 5 mg, 0.1%; 10 mg, 0.5%; 15 mg, 3.9%; 20 mg, 12.1%; and 25 mg, 30.0%, resulting in a MTD for idarubicin of 20 mg.

SECTION

Safety

PARAGRAPH

All patients experienced at least one AE possibly attributable to the procedure within the month after the first or the second session.

Including the two patients with a DLT, a total of nine patients (60%) presented with at least one grade ≥3 AE.

There were no differences in terms of frequency and severity of any AE after the first or second session.

The most frequent grade 3 or 4 AEs were biological: elevated γ-glutamyltranspeptidase [GGT; 33% (26% after the first session, 7% after the second session)], neutropenia [27% (20% after the first session, 7% after the second session)], and leukocytopoenia (20% after the second session) (Table 3).

No patients had any grade of alopecia, mucositis or skin discoloration.

As expected, no patients developed post-embolisation syndrome.

PARAGRAPH

There was a transient increase in both aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels after the first session, peaking at 48 h (mean difference ASTH48–ASTH0 = 126 ± 112, p <10−3; mean difference ALTH48–ALTH0 = 117 ± 63, p <10−3), but the levels gradually returned to baseline values.

Comparable transient increases in both AST and ALT were observed after the second session.

GGT, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin levels did not vary significantly during the study period.

Grade 3 neutropaenia, leukocytopoenia, thrombocytopaenia, and anaemia occurred in four (27%), three (20%), two (13%), and two (13%) patients, respectively.

There was no grade 4 haematological toxicity, and renal function remained normal in all patients during the study period.

PARAGRAPH

At the end of the study, one death had occurred, but only four (27%) patients presented with at least one grade 3 toxicity with no clinical symptoms [elevated GGT (n = 3), neutropaenia (n = 2), leukocytopoenia (n = 2), and elevated ALP (n = 1)].

There were no cases of deterioration in the Child-Pugh class or changes in ECG or LVEF from baseline among these 14 patients.

SECTION

Technical success and efficacy

PARAGRAPH

Technical success was 93% (26 of 28 sessions), with injection of the whole emulsion.

In the two sessions, all of the emulsion was injected but not all of the nodules could be targeted.

PARAGRAPH

Response was assessed by MRI of the liver in all patients except the patient who died on day 27.

Using mRECIST criteria, CR, PR, SD, and PD were observed in zero, four (29%), seven (50%), and three (21%) patients, respectively, one month after the second session.

At idarubicin doses of 10, 15, 20, and 25 mg, an objective response was observed in zero, one (25%), two (33%), and one (33%) patients, respectively (p = 0.60).

The objective response rate in patients without vascular invasion was 40% (4/10), whereas no patients with portal vein tumour thrombosis had an objective response (0%; 0/5; one SD, three PD, and one death).

Follow-up AFP levels were available in all patients except the patient who died on day 27.

Globally, the mean AFP level decreased from 1396 ± 3130 (baseline) to 957 ± 1731 ng/ml (p = 0.10).

PARAGRAPH

After the study period, patients were treated as follows: surveillance only (two patients with PR), two additional idarubicin lipiodolisation sessions (two patients with PR), conventional TACE with idarubicin (seven patients with SD), sorafenib (one patient with PD), and best supportive care (two patients with PD).

TTP in the two patients who had surveillance only after the study period was 9 and 10 months.

Both were treated by conventional TACE with idarubicin at progression.

Of the two patients who received two additional idarubicin lipiodolisation sessions immediately after the study, one achieved a CR and experienced disease progression 21 months after the end of the four sessions.

At the time of the progression, this patient received four additional idarubicin lipiodolisation sessions (total of eight), achieving a PR with no significant treatment-related AE.

However, the patient died one year later following new PD.

The second patient showed an improved tumour response and underwent radiofrequency ablation.

Two years later, the patient was still in complete response with no additional treatment and had maintained a low AFP level (5 ng/ml vs. 3,200 ng/ml at baseline).

PARAGRAPH

At the time of the study closure, after a median follow-up of 18.1 months, no patients were lost to follow-up, and nine (60%) patients had died after PD.

During the follow-up period, all patients had undergone liver MRI examinations.

The median TTP was 5.4 months (95% CI 3.0–14.6 months).

The median OS was 20.6 months (95% CI 5.7–28.7 months).

There were no differences in terms of TTP and OS according to the idarubicin dose.

SECTION

Pharmacokinetics

SECTION

Idarubicin

PARAGRAPH

Idarubicin plasma concentrations reached a mean observed Cmax 5 min (range, 5–10 min) after the end of the injection and then decreased biexponentially (Fig. 1).

Mean Cmax and AUC0–24h increased linearly with the dose from 10 mg to 25 mg (Table 4).

SECTION

Idarubicinol

PARAGRAPH

Idarubicinol concentrations increased markedly during the first 5 min after the end of the injection and then reached a slowly increasing plateau (Fig. 2).

Given that Cmax was not achieved after the first 24 h, it was irrelevant to calculate the AUC0–24h.

SECTION

Heath-related quality of life

PARAGRAPH

The rate of questionnaire completion was 87% (13/15 patients).

The results are summarised in Table 5 for the 15, 20, and 25 mg doses of idarubicin because the only patient who received idarubicin 10 mg did not complete the final questionnaire.

Global health deteriorated in four (36%) patients.

Regardless of the dose of idarubicin, global health, physical functioning, emotional functioning, fatigue, pain, and dyspnoea were the most frequently deteriorated dimensions.

Regardless of the dimension, we found no relationship between mean differences in scores and idarubicin dose.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The MTD of idarubicin was found to be 20 mg.

DLTs included oedematous-ascitic decompensation and abdominal pain, which are common complications of transarterial procedures.

The main cause of death of one patient 27 days after the first transarterial injection remains unclear.

The patient had no contra-indication to receiving the transarterial injection.

The fast progression of the tumour thrombosis associated with oedematous-ascitic decompensation might have resulted in his death.

The patient was discharged after recovering a satisfactory clinical and biological health status, but died 13 days later from pulmonary embolism.

PARAGRAPH

In a previous study that assessed the MTD of idarubicin loaded on to particles, the authors reported a MTD of 10 mg, half that of the current study, even though patients had only one TACE session in the IDASPHERE trial.26

Inclusion/exclusion criteria and DLT definitions were similar in the two trials, thereby confirming that the transarterial regimen without embolisation is better tolerated.

The two fold higher MTD reported in the current study could be explained by the absence of embolisation.

PARAGRAPH

Besides the two DLTs, the most frequent treatment-related AEs at one month after the second session were, as expected, biological.

The 60% rate of cumulated (both sessions) treatment-related grade ≥3 AEs was close to that of 52% reported after one TACE session in the IDASPHERE trial, although there were some regimen-related specificities.

The frequency of grade ≥3 leukocytopoenia, neutropaenia (not associated with fever or infection), and anaemia was slightly higher in the present study: 20%, 27%, and 13% vs.10%, 5% and 5% in the IDASPHERE trial, respectively.

Conversely, the frequency of grade ≥3 abdominal pain was five times higher in the IDASPHERE trial (38% vs. 7%).

The frequency of grade >3 hepatic biological toxicities was slightly lower in the present study than in the IDASPHERE trial: elevated AST, 13% and 33%; elevated ALT, 7% and 10%; elevated GGT, 33% and 29%; and hyperbilirubinaemia, 7% and 5%, respectively.

The slightly higher toxicity on white and/or red cells in the LIDA-B trial could be explained by a greater systemic release of idarubicin directly in response to the higher injected doses used.

Conversely, the absence of post-embolisation syndrome as well as the lower rate of abdominal pain in the LIDA-B trial are probably results of the absence of embolisation.

PARAGRAPH

Apart from neutropaenia and leukocytopoenia, none of the usual anthracycline-related systemic toxicities were detected in the current study.

By contrast, the frequencies of alopecia, mucositis, and skin discoloration in the PRECISION V trial (conventional doxorubicin TACE vs. drug-eluting beads) were 1–20%, 4–6%, and 2%, respectively.27

This is probably because: (1) we used low doses of idarubicin compared with recommended doses for acute leukaemia (commonly 12 mg/m2/day for three consecutive days); and (2) the idarubicin_lipiodol emulsion was optimised to limit the systemic diffusion of the drug, as previously reported.17

PARAGRAPH

No cases of cardiac toxicity or heart failure were reported during the month after the second session or in patients who received up to eight transarterial sessions for a total dose of idarubicin 160 mg (20 mg per session).

This finding is not surprising, given that the relative cardiotoxicity of idarubicin is 0.57 (lowest value among all anthracyclines) compared with a reference of 1.00 for doxorubicin and that idarubicin shows cardiac toxicity at a total cumulative dose of 150 mg/m2.28

Therefore, a patient with a body area of 1.8/m2 can theoretically receive 13 chemolipiodolisation sessions each of idarubicin 20 mg before reaching the cumulative cardiotoxic dose.

PARAGRAPH

TACE is currently performed with long time intervals between sessions: ≥4 weeks or longer depending on tumour progression at follow-up imaging.15

In this case, the chemotherapeutic agent can be regarded more as a helper, assisting embolisation to maximise tumour cell death.

Conversely, in the context of chemolipiodolisation, the efficacy relies exclusively on the chemotherapeutic agent carried by lipiodol.

Lipiodol alone does not appear to have any cytotoxic effect against HCC cell lines29,30 but it is taken up and retained selectively in HCC tumours,31,32 thereby increasing intratumoural drug concentrations.33

By not performing embolisation, it becomes possible to treat the whole liver every three weeks to limit tumour repopulation between each cycle, as proposed for hepatic arterial infusions of oxaliplatin in colorectal liver metastases.34

In the current trial, we performed only two sessions to validate the concept.

Two patients received additional sessions that improved the tumour response on further liver MRI follow-up, without any additional AE.

An ongoing phase II trial will explore the efficacy of this regimen.

PARAGRAPH

The limited systemic toxicity of idarubicin reported in our study could also be explained by its interesting PK profile obtained using this modality of injection.

The mean Cmax of idarubicin after intra-arterial injection of the idarubicin-lipiodol emulsion is approximately half the Cmax after intravenous administration.35

This can be explained by the high stability of the idarubicin_lipiodol emulsion17 and the preferential uptake of lipiodol by HCC tumours.31,32

In addition to the relatively low toxicity of doxorubicin on HCC cells,16 doxorubicin_lipiodol emulsions are not stable, their mixture producing an immiscible suspension that quickly divides into its oily and aqueous phases.17,36

Even though Raoul et al. demonstrated a benefit in terms of doxorubicin Cmax after intra-arterial doxorubicin_lipiodol, mainly with but also without embolisation, over intra-arterial doxorubicin,33 other studies did not demonstrate any PK advantage of intra-arterial doxorubicin_lipiodol therapies.

Johnson et al. reported that systemic doxorubicin levels after intra-arterial administration were similar irrespective of the addition of lipiodol.37

Moreover, Kalayci et al. showed that the peak concentration and AUC of doxorubicin did not differ between systemic chemotherapy and chemolipiodolisation.38

PARAGRAPH

The objective response rate reported in this trial according to mRECIST criteria was 29%, with no relationship between response and idarubicin dose.

Not surprisingly,15,39 no patient with tumour thrombosis responded, whereas all the other patients had tumour control after the two sessions.

However, for TACE,39 tumour thrombosis is not a good indication for idarubicin_lipiodol and will be an exclusion criterion in the ongoing phase II trial.

With a median OS of 20.6 months, our results are encouraging, with OS close to the 20 months reported in the EASL/EORTC guidelines1 and greater than the 10.1 months reported in the Asian phase III trial with triple-drug chemolipiodolisation without embolisation.12

PARAGRAPH

HrQoL and OS are the two only criteria recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency to approve drugs in oncology.40,41

Moreover, HrQoL in phase I trials could add information related to perceived toxicities and symptoms to better select optimal doses for HCC.42

The HrQoL results gave no indication that increased doses of idarubicin worsened quality of life.

None of the 15 HrQoL dimensions were adversely affected, thus confirming the good safety results achieved with this drug.

Interestingly, the proportion of patients experiencing increased fatigue in the present study was approximately half that in patients treated with idarubicin-eluting beads (36% vs. 65%, respectively26).

PARAGRAPH

In summary, the MTD of idarubicin emulsified in 10 ml-lipiodol was 20 mg for intra-arterial treatment of HCC.

This new regimen without embolisation was well tolerated and resulted in promising efficacy in terms of tumour control and survival.

A phase II trial based on this regimen is about to start recruitment.
