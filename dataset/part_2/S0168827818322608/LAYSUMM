TITLE

Chimeric liver transplantation reveals interspecific graft remodelling

PARAGRAPH

Chimeric animals are composed of cells from different species.

Chimeric animals carrying human tissue have the potential to increase the availability of transplantable organs.

We transplanted rat-to-mouse liver grafts into newly weaned rats.

The chimeric grafts underwent post-transplant remodelling with rat hepatocytes replacing all mouse hepatocytes within 56â€¯days.

In addition, we observed the post-transplant development of diffuse mature rat bile ducts through the transformation of hepatocytes, and patchy areas of portal endothelium originating from the host.

These data demonstrate the efficacy of transplanting rat-to-mouse chimeric livers into rats, with a high potential for post-transplant graft remodelling.
