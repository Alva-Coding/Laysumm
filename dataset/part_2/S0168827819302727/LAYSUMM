TITLE

Outcomes of liver transplantation for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: A European Liver Transplant Registry study

PARAGRAPH

The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has increased dramatically in parallel with the worldwide increase in obesity and diabetes.

Its progressive form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, is a growing indication for liver transplantation in Europe, with good overall outcomes reported.

However, careful risk factor assessment is required to maintain favourable post-transplant outcomes in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.
