TITLE

Glycogen synthase kinase 3β promotes liver innate immune activation by restraining AMP-activated protein kinase activation

PARAGRAPH

Glycogen synthase kinase 3β promotes macrophage inflammatory activation by inhibiting the immune regulatory signalling of AMP-activated protein kinase and the induction of small heterodimer partner.

Therefore, therapeutic targeting of glycogen synthase kinase 3β enhances innate immune regulation and protects liver from ischaemia and reperfusion injury.
