TITLE

A schistosome miRNA promotes host hepatic fibrosis by targeting transforming growth factor beta receptor III

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Schistosomiasis is one of the most prevalent, but unfortunately neglected, tropical infectious diseases, affecting more than 240 million people across 78 countries.1

The 2 most important species that cause liver disease in humans are Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum).

Female schistosoma living in the mesenteric veins of hosts lay numerous eggs, many of which are trapped in the liver via the portal venous system.

Highly immunogenic substances released by parasite eggs induce a granulomatous and fibrotic response, which is characterized by T helper-2 cytokines (interleukin [IL]-4 and IL-13), eosinophils, and alternatively activated macrophages.2

Hepatic fibrosis is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality associated with schistosomiasis.

It is a very complicated process that involves many host-derived mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and microRNAs.3

These host-derived mediators collectively contribute to promote the trans-differentiation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) into activated myofibroblasts, which are responsible for production of collagen and fibrogenesis within the granuloma site.4

It would be interesting to explore parasite-derived factors that are associated with the pathogenesis and progression of this disease, in order to identify potential therapeutic targets.

PARAGRAPH

MicroRNAs (MiRNAs) are a highly conserved group of small, non-coding RNA molecules found in animals, pathogens and plants that play an important role in post-transcriptional gene regulation.5

It has been well documented that miRNAs are critically relevant in nearly all developmental, physiological and pathological processes.6

Recent findings have indicated that miRNAs secreted by cells in one area can regulate the gene expression and phenotype of distant recipient cells.7

Strikingly, miRNAs derived from parasites, and even from plants have been detected in human or animal body fluids and have been found to modulate host genes.8

Recent studies show that miRNAs can be secreted from pathogens and plants and transported into distant host recipient cells, where they regulate host gene expression in a cross-species manner.

The identified miRNAs include miR-168a from rice, which inhibits expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor adapter protein 1 in mice;9 miRNAs contained in parasite exosomes that suppress type 2 innate immunity in mice;10 and small RNAs from a fungal pathogen that silence plant host immunity genes.11

Despite these findings, there is no experimental evidence to demonstrate that miRNAs from pathogens are involved in the occurrence and progression of host disease during infection.

PARAGRAPH

S. japonicum secretes extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as exosomes, which contain miRNAs generated by the parasite (sja-miRNAs).12,13

It is well documented that EVs play a role in cell-cell communication or pathogen-host interaction.

As described earlier, schistosome eggs are trapped in liver tissue, and this induces a granulomatous reaction.

In the granuloma, eggs are trapped and surrounded by immunocytes and other hepatic mesenchymal cells including HSCs.14

Thus, at the start of this study, we hypothesized that the living miracidium inside the eggs located in the center of the granuloma secretes exosomes containing parasite miRNAs that enter the cytosol of HSCs, where they regulate activation of HSCs and induce hepatic fibrosis.

In this study, we have proved this hypothesis by identifying a sja-miRNA, sja-miR-2162, that is consistently present in host HSCs during schistosome infection, and is involved in cross-species regulation of host hepatic fibrosis by targeting the transforming growth factor beta receptor III (Tgfbr3) in the host.

Identification of sja-miRNAs involved in regulating host hepatic fibrosis

PARAGRAPH

The first step of our investigation was to isolate primary HSCs from infected mice to identify sja-miRNAs that are present in host HSCs through RNA sequencing, in order to identify potential sja-miRNAs that may be involved in host hepatic fibrosis.

The RNA sample from the HSCs was carefully analyzed to ensure that there was no contamination with parasite RNA from eggs lodged in the host liver tissues.

To this end, the sample was analyzed to ensure that 2 highly expressed genes of the parasite were not detectable (Fig. S2A).

We identified 8 sja-miRNAs that were fully matched with schistosome miRNA sequences in the infected HSCs (Fig. S2B); Of the 8 sja-miRNAs, 3 were parasite-specific miRNAs, including sja-imR-2162, while the rest were conserved miRNAs, which have the same seed sequences as the corresponding host miRNAs (Fig. S2C).

The presence of the 8 identified parasite miRNAs in the infected HSCs was verified by qPCR, while 2 additional sja-miRNAs that were not present in the HSCs were not detected (Fig. S2D).

PARAGRAPH

Next, we carried out screening and identification of sja-miRNAs that potentially regulate hepatic fibrosis.

To this end, we synthesized mimics of 51 sja-miRNAs that were identified by us and other groups,19–21 and transfected them into an immortal rat HSC cell line, HSC-T6.

We identified 17 sja-miRNAs, including sja-miR-2162, that upregulated the expression of fibrosis-related genes, such as Col1α1, Col3α1, or α-smooth muscle actin (α-Sma); these findings indicated that these sja-miRNAs potentially regulate hepatic fibrosis (Fig. S3).

From the identified sja-miRNAs involved in hepatic fibrosis, sja-miR-2162 was also detected in the host HSCs (Fig. S2).

In addition, sja-miR-2162 was the only parasite-specific miRNA which upregulated the expression of all the HSC activation-associated genes detected.

Thus, we selected sja-miR-2162 for further investigation of its role in schistosomiasis-associated hepatic fibrosis.

SECTION

Role of sja-miR-2162 in regulating the activation of host HSCs

PARAGRAPH

To investigate the role of sja-miR-2162 in activating HSCs, we first constructed a recombinant plasmid expressing sja-miR-2162 (designated as “expression plasmid”) (Fig. S4A).

In order to determine whether mammalian cells can process the schistosome pri-sja-miR-2162 into mature sja-miR-2162, we constructed a sja-miR-2162 sensor plasmid (designated as “sensor plasmid”) carrying a firefly luciferase (Fluc) reporter gene and a Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene that is regulated by 3 copies of the sja-miR-2162 target site (Fig. S4A).

The 293T cell line was co-transfected with both plasmids, with the ratio of Rluc:Fluc activity reflecting the bioactivity of sja-miR-2162.

We found that in the absence of the expression plasmid, no reduction of Rluc activity was observed in comparison with the control (Fig. S4B).

In contrast, co-transfection with a higher concentration of the expression plasmid led to a reduction of Rluc activity, indicating that the expression plasmid produced mature sja-miR-2162 in the cell line that suppressed expression of the Rluc gene by targeting the sites of this miRNA (Fig. S4B).

Importantly, transfection of the expression plasmid into various HSC cell lines, such as human, rat and mouse HSCs, significantly upregulated expression of the Col1α1, Col3α1, and α-Sma mRNA, which indicates that sja-miR-2162 promotes in vitro HSC activation and production of collagens and α-SMA (Fig. 1A; Fig. S5A).

SECTION

Role of sja-miR-2162 in promoting hepatic fibrosis in naïve mice

PARAGRAPH

To examine whether expression of sja-miR-2162 induces hepatic fibrosis in mice, we used the highly hepatotropic recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (rAAV8) to express pri-sja-miR-2162 or scramble miRNA (SCR control).

Naïve mice were intravenously injected with the vectors or PBS.

By day 40 and 100 after injection, hepatic fibrosis was induced in the mice that were injected with the rAAV8-pri-sja-miR-2162 vector, as characterized by significantly elevated hydroxyproline content and expression of fibrosis-associated genes compared to the mice that were injected with the SCR control vector or PBS (Fig. 1B and 1C; Fig. S5B and 5C).

Extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition was significantly increased by day 100 but not day 40 after injection, as shown by Masson's trichrome staining (Fig. 1D; Fig. S5D).

Further, the primary HSCs of injected mice were isolated to quantify the expression of Col1α1, Col3α1, α-Sma, Col4α1, and Timp1 mRNA.

Our data showed that expression of all these fibrotic genes was significantly increased in the HSCs from rAAV8-pri-sja-miR-2162-injected mice compared to the HSCs from mice in the control groups (Fig. 1E; Fig. S5E).

These findings indicate that sja-miR-2162 promotes hepatic fibrosis in vivo.

PARAGRAPH

Regarding the possible effect of sja-miR-2162 on other liver cells, we analyzed the genes that could regulate hepatic fibrosis in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells isolated from naïve mice injected with the rAAV8-pri-sja-miR-2162.

The result showed that the expression of sja-miR-2162 was detected in both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells (Fig. S6).

However, the elevation of sja-miR-2162 did not alter the production of profibrotic mediators, such as TGF-β1, CTGF and IL-33 in hepatocytes, or the differentiation of Kupffer cells, characterized by iNOS, TNF-α, Arg1 and TGF- β1 (Fig. S6), implying that the presence of sja-miR-2162 in these cells should have no effect on fibrosis progression.

SECTION

Involvement of sja-miR-2162 in schistosomiasis-associated hepatic fibrosis

PARAGRAPH

To investigate whether sja-miR-2162 is involved in the progression of schistosomiasis-associated hepatic fibrosis during infection, we constructed a rAAV8-anti-sja-miR-2162-sponge vector (designated as “sponge vector”) that could inhibit sja-miR-2162 function by binding to this miRNA (Fig. S7A).

The potency and specificity of the sponge vector was validated for inhibition of sja-miR-2162 function in the 293T cell line (Fig. S7B).

Next, mice were exposed to a mild dose of parasites and treated with the sponge vector or SCR control vector.

By 8 weeks and 10 weeks after infection, mice injected with the sponge vector displayed a significant reduction in ECM depositions compared to the mice injected with the SCR control vector, as demonstrated by hydroxyproline quantification (Fig. 2A; Fig. S8A) and Masson's trichrome staining (Fig. 2B and 2D; Fig. S8B and 8D).

In addition, the size of hepatic granulomas was markedly reduced in the mice treated with the sponge vector, as visualized by H&E staining (Fig. 2C and 2D; Fig. S8C and 8D).

This attenuation of hepatic fibrosis was further validated by qPCR-based quantification of fibrosis-related genes, which showed that the expression of collagens, α-Sma, and Timp1 was significantly reduced in the liver of mice treated with the sponge vector (Fig. 2E; Fig. S8E).

Consistent with our previous results, the vectors did not affect the survival or egg production of parasites in the hosts (Fig. 2F; Fig. S8F).

PARAGRAPH

Next, we isolated primary HSCs from the mice to quantify the expression of markers of HSC activation, and found that the expression of collagens, α-Sma , and Timp1 genes was significantly decreased in the HSCs of mice injected with the sponge vector compared to mice injected with the control vector or PBS (Fig. 2G; Fig. S8G).

To further validate the internalization of sja-miR-2162 into HSCs and its impact on fibrosis, we also isolated primary HSCs from infected mice at day 49 after infection and transfected them with sja-miR-2162 inhibitors, the synthesized anti-sense of sja-miR-2162.

We showed that the inhibitor significantly reduced the expression of collagens, α-Sma, and Timp1 in the infected HSCs compared to the negative control (NC) (Fig. 2H; Fig. S8H); this indicates that the inhibitor neutralized the internalized sja-miR-2162 in infected HSCs and thereby suppressed the expression of fibrosis-related genes.

Taken together, all of the aforementioned data indicate that during schistosomiasis, sja-miR-2162 secreted by the parasite can enter the cytosol of HSCs and promote the activation of HSCs and hepatic fibrosis.

SECTION

Internalization of sja-miR-2162 in host HSCs through parasite exosomes

PARAGRAPH

Our data show that sja-miR-2162 is present in host HSCs and plays a role in hepatic fibrosis.

Next, we investigated how schistosome miRNA is delivered to HSCs.

We previously reported that schistosome egg-derived exosomes are highly abundant in sja-miR-2162.12

Based on this finding, in the present study, we isolated egg-derived exosomes and incubated them with primary HSCs from naïve mice.

We found that the exosomes promoted activation of HSCs, as demonstrated by upregulation of the expression of collagens and α-Sma, while transfection of the HSCs with a sja-miR-2162 inhibitor partially blocked the effect of the exosome-mediated activation of HSCs, as demonstrated by significant reductions in the expression of collagens and α-Sma compared to the NC (Fig. S9).

These findings indicate that sja-miR-2162 might be transported to the cytosol of HSCs via exosomes.

SECTION

Sja-miR-2162-mediated activation of host HSCs by targeting the TGFBR3

PARAGRAPH

We combined bioinformatic analysis and RNA sequencing to screen the target genes of sja-miR-2162 in the HSCs.

The miRDB database predicts 181 potential target genes of sja-miR-2162 in mice (http://mirdb.org), which contain the target sites of sja-miR-2162 at their 3′UTR (Fig. 3A).

The RNA sequencing analysis identified 324 upregulated mRNAs and 470 downregulated mRNAs in the primary HSCs transfected with sja-miR-2162 mimics compared to the NC (Fig. S10A).

Only 2 target genes (Pcdh9 and Tgfbr3) predicted by miRDB database were markedly downregulated in the RNA sequencing data (Fig. S10B).

In addition, Gene Ontology analysis indicated that deregulated genes were mainly enriched in “extracellular structure organization”, “extracellular matrix organization”, “response to wounding”, and “wound healing” (Fig. S10C).

It is reported that TGFBR3 serves as a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling,22,23 which plays a crucial role in ECM production and wound healing response.

Thus, based on the analysis above, we selected the Tgfbr3 as a potential target gene for further investigation.

PARAGRAPH

To examine the relationship between sja-miR-2162 and Tgfbr3, we first analyzed their expression in the HSCs of infected mice.

We found that the expression of sja-miR-2162 was dramatically elevated in host HSCs during infection, and that it peaked at day 40 after infection (Fig. 3B; Fig. S11A).

In contrast, expression of the Tgfbr3 mRNA was markedly decreased during infection, and it reached the lowest level at day 40 after infection (Fig. 3C; Fig. S11B).

These findings indicate that the expression of sja-miR-2162 and Tgfbr3 mRNA are negatively associated.

PARAGRAPH

To examine whether Tgfbr3 is a direct target of sja-miR-2162, we generated a reporter vector that contains the Fluc gene fused to the 3ʹUTR of Tgfbr3 mRNA, which contains the putative target site of sja-miR-2162.

293T cells were co-transfected with the construct and sja-miR-2162 mimics or the NC.

As shown in Fig. 3D or Fig. S11C, a significant reduction in luciferase activity was detected in the cells transfected with sja-miR-2162 mimics, compared to the cells treated with the NC.

By contrast, mutation of 6 nucleotides in the seed-binding sequence of the 3ʹUTR of Tgfbr3 led to a complete abrogation of inhibition.

Furthermore, transfection of the HSCs of uninfected mice with the sja-pri-miR-2162 expression plasmid significantly reduced the expression of Tgfbr3 mRNA and protein (Fig. 3E; Fig. S11D), while depletion of sja-miR-2162 in the infected HSCs via its inhibitor significantly increased the expression of Tgfbr3 mRNA and protein (Fig. 3F; Fig. S11E).

We also found that the expression of Tgfbr3 mRNA and protein in primary HSCs from infected livers treated with the sponge vector was markedly elevated compared to HSCs from infected livers treated with the control vector (Fig. 3G; Fig. S11F).

These data indicated that Tgfbr3 was a direct target of sja-miR-2162 in host HSCs.

PARAGRAPH

To elucidate the role of Tgfbr3 in the activation of HSCs, we transfected Tgfbr3 siRNA into primary HSCs from naïve mice.

We found that the siRNA-mediated inhibition of Tgfbr3 clearly promoted the activation of HSCs, as demonstrated by elevated collagen and α-Sma expression (Fig. 4A).

Consistent with previous reports on the role of Tgfbr3 as a negative regulator of TGF-β/SMAD signaling, 22,23 we found that the phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 was markedly increased in HSCs after they were transfected with Tgfbr3 siRNA or sja-miR-2162 mimics (Fig. 4B).

In addition, we detected phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3 in primary HSCs from infected livers treated with the sponge vector, and found that the level of phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3 was markedly decreased compared to the control vector (Fig. 4C), indicating that rAAV8-mediated efficient and sustained inhibition of sja-miR-2162 led to significantly elevated expression of TGFBR3 and thereby reduced SMAD signaling and collagen production.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The present study is the first to demonstrate that parasite miRNAs contribute to the progression of schistosomiasis-associated hepatic fibrosis during infection, based on the following evidence: i) presence of a parasite-specific miRNA, sja-miR-2162, in the HSCs of the host that promotes the activation of host HSCs by targeting the Tgfbr3 gene; ii) promotion of hepatic fibrosis in vivo by delivery of sja-miR-2162 to the liver of naïve mice; iii) attenuation of hepatic fibrosis in infected mice by efficient and sustained inhibition of sja-miR-2162 via reduction of collagens and α-SMA production; iv) reduction of the expression of fibrosis-related genes by transfection of a sja-miR-2162 inhibitor into the HSCs of infected mice or into in vitro-activated HSCs via the egg-derived exosome.

Thus, these data have proved that sja-miR-2162 directly regulates the activation of HSCs during schistosome infection.

In addition to sja-miR-2162, several other parasite miRNAs, such as sja-Bantam and sja-miR-1, were also present in HSCs of infected mice and could promote the activation of HSCs in vitro, thus warranting further investigations.

PARAGRAPH

TGF-β is one of the most potent pro-fibrotic cytokines in various organs.

It exerts its effects by binding to heteromeric complexes of type 1 (TGFBR1), type 2 (TGFBR2), and type 3 (TGFBR3) TGF-β receptors.

Following ligand binding, the TGFBR2 kinases phosphorylate cytoplasmic domains and thereby activate TGFBR1 and then the SMAD pathway.24

As TGFBR3 has a short cytoplasmic domain with no intrinsic kinase activity, its role in TGF-β signaling has not been well characterized.

TGFBR3 is believed to act as a TGF-β co-receptor, which concentrates the ligand on the cell surface and enhances binding of the ligand to TGFBR2.25

However, emerging evidence indicates that TGFBR3 serves as a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling.

For example, it has been reported that endocytosis of TGFBR3 mediated by β-arrestin 2 dampens TGF-β signaling.26

In addition, TGFBR3 undergoes ectodomain shedding and releases the soluble extracellular domain (sTGFBR3), which effectively neutralizes the TGF-β ligand and thereby attenuates TGF-β/SMAD signaling.27

Further, there is a lot of recent evidence demonstrating that TGFBR3 is a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling in fibroblast activation and induction of fibrosis.22,23

In this study, our in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that sja-miR-2162 directly targets the Tgfbr3 gene and thereby downregulates its expression, leading to activation of HSCs and elevated expression of collagens and α-SMA.

Further, AAV8-mediated efficient and sustained inhibition of Sja-miR-2162 led to significantly elevated expression of TGFBR3 and thereby reduced collagen production.

In addition, siRNA-mediated inhibition of Tgfbr3 markedly increased the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 and thereby induced hepatic fibrosis.

Thus, the data from the present study seem to support previous findings that TGFBR3 is a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling.

PARAGRAPH

Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate hepatic fibrosis has been a major research objective of schistosomiasis for decades.

It is now well documented that hepatic schistosomiasis is an immunopathological disease.2

A type 2 immune response, elicited by egg antigens, is believed to be the central regulator of disease progression in schistosomiasis.

Further, profibrogenic cytokines released during the immune response, such as IL-13 and TGF-β1, can promote the activation of HSCs and hepatic fibrosis through the SMAD pathway.15

The present study expands on the already reported findings by clearly showing that in addition to the profibrogenic cytokines, the schistosome miRNA sja-miR-2162 directly promotes hepatic fibrogenesis in a cross-species manner.

The sja-miRNA (sja-miR-2162) identified here is a parasite-specific miRNA and is highly expressed in all stages of the S. japonicum life cycle and detected in the liver tissue and serum of infected mice.17,28

Thus, our data provide new insights into the pathologic mechanism of hepatic schistosomiasis.

Moreover, it expands our understanding of the role of pathogen-derived miRNAs in the pathologic mechanisms of other infectious diseases, such as parasitic and fungal diseases, in which the participating pathogens secrete miRNAs that promote various disease processes such as fibrosis.

Thus, pathogen-derived miRNAs may represent a novel class of universal modulators that play an important role in the pathology of infectious diseases, and AAV8-mediated efficient and sustained inhibition of these pathogen-derived miRNAs might present a promising therapeutic intervention for these diseases.
