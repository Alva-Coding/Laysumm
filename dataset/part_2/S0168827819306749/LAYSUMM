TITLE

A schistosome miRNA promotes host hepatic fibrosis by targeting transforming growth factor beta receptor III

PARAGRAPH

A schistosome-specific microRNA, sja-miR-2162, is consistently present in the hepatic stellate cells of mice infected with S. japonicum, where it promotes hepatic fibrosis in the host through cross-species regulation of host fibrosis-related genes.

The efficient and sustained inhibition of pathogen-derived micRNAs may represent a novel therapeutic intervention for infectious diseases.
