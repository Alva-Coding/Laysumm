TITLE

Generation of hepatobiliary organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

To date, most of the pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-based liver modeling systems have initiated differentiation from highly purified definitive endoderm (DE) and have generated monolayer hepatocyte-like cells.1–5

However, preclinical predictions from such models are usually difficult to interpret, and may be misleading, because homogeneous DE populations are insufficient to accurately replicate the complex regulation of signals among cells and tissues during liver organogenesis.6

A recent study, which mimicked liver development by combining hepatic endoderm cells with endothelial cells and mesenchymal progenitors, resulted in the generation of a liver bud-like structure with improved function.7

Similarly, co-culture of fetal liver progenitor cells and liver extracellular matrix triggered the formation of hepatocytes with bile duct-like structures.8

These findings highlighted the importance of multicellular interactions during early liver development.

However, these studies combined cells that were isolated from multiple and postnatal individuals, suggesting a severe limitation of the transplanting applications based on these strategies.

PARAGRAPH

Here, we reported a method to generate functional hepatobiliary organoids (HBOs) from hiPSCs.

To achieve this goal, we learned from early hepatogenesis and simultaneously induced endoderm and a small part of mesoderm by the inclusion of 25% mTeSR into hepatic differentiation medium.

This treatment mildly suppressed/delayed early hepatic differentiation, but turned on biliary specification by activating the NOTCH2 and TGF-β signaling pathway.

Then we achieved co-differentiation of hepatocyte-like cells and cholangiocyte-like cells.

Finally, our uniquely prepared cholesterol+ MIX (mainly comprised of cholesterol and other small molecules) promoted the HBO formation and functional maturation.

Differentiation of hepatobiliary organoids

PARAGRAPH

Before the initiation of hepatobiliary differentiation, PSCs were dissociated into clumps using Dispase (Sigma-Aldrich), and were plated onto Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix Growth Factor Reduced (BD Biosciences).

When the cells attained a confluence of 80–90% (depending on the cell line), mTeSR was replaced with RPMI1640/B27 minus insulin (Gibco) containing 100 ng/ml Activin A and 20 ng/ml BMP4 (Peprotech) for 5 h.

The medium was then replaced with RPMI1640/B27 containing 25% mTeSR, 100 ng/ml Activin A and 20 ng/ml BMP4 for 2 days, followed by RPMI1640/B27 containing 100 ng/ml Activin A, and cultured for another 2 days.

Next, the cultures were placed in RPMI1640/B27 containing 25% mTeSR, 30 ng/ml FGF4 and 20 ng/ml BMP2 (Peprotech) for 5 days, and in RPMI1640/B27 containing 25% mTeSR, 20 ng/ml HGF and 20 ng/ml KGF (both from Peprotech) and cultured for a further 6 days.

Finally, the differentiated cells were cultured in HCM supplemented with 10 ng/ml oncostatin M (OSM) (R&D System) and 0.1 µM dexamethasone (Dex) (Sigma-Aldrich) with or without 10% cholesterol+ MIX for 20 days.

Subsequently, cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM (Gibco) containing ascorbic acid (1:1,000), fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (1:500), transferrin (1:1,000), insulin (1:1,000), gentamicin/amphotericin-B (1:1,000) (Lonza), 10 ng/ml OSM with or without 10% cholesterol+ MIX for further culture.

Medium was changed every 24 h.

The differentiation protocol and sequential morphological changes are illustrated in Fig. 1.

Analysis of bile acids by LC-MS/MS

PARAGRAPH

Briefly, cystic organoids were washed in cold PBS and punctured using a microsyringe.

The liquid in the cystic structures was then aspirated under the microscope and diluted with 50% methanol for LC-MS/MS analysis.

The samples were stored at −20 °C.

PARAGRAPH

For each sample, 20 μl of a 50 μM cholic acid (in methanol) was added to 60 μl of the diluted sample.

Methanol was used as an internal standard.

The mixture was deproteinized by the addition of 200 μl of acetonitrile.

Each sample was vortexed for 10 s and centrifuged at 14,000g at 4 °C for 5 min.

The supernatant was transferred to a new glass tube and extracted with 2 ml of a mixture of ethyl acetate and t-butyl methyl ether (2:1).

After centrifugation at 3,000g at 4 °C for 15 min, the organic phase was transferred to a new glass tube and evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas.

The residue was reconstituted in 60 μl of 50% methanol solution containing 0.2% formic acid.

Ten microliters of each reconstituted sample were injected into a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for analysis.

PARAGRAPH

LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on each sample using an API 2000 Mass Spectrometer (SCIEX) equipped with a Shimadzu HPLC LC-20 AD (Shimadzu).

A Phenomenex Luna C18 analytical column (3 μm, 100 mm × 2 mm inner diameter column) (Torrance) was used to separate free bile acids.

The flow rate through the column, conducted at ambient temperature was 0.2 ml/min, and optimal resolution was achieved by elution with a linear gradient of water containing 0.1% formic acid (45%→0%) and methanol (55%→100%) for 10 min at RT.

The mass spectrometer was operated in the turbo ion spray mode with positive ion detection.

The turbo ion spray temperature was maintained at 350 °C, and a voltage of 4.8 kV was applied to the sprayer needle.

The detection and quantification of free and conjugated bile acids and the internal standard were accomplished by multiple reaction monitoring with the transition m/z 403.3/367.4 for dehydrocholic acid, 359.1/135.0 for lithocholic acid, 375.1/357.2 for free deoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, hyodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, and murideoxycholic acid, 373.1/355.3 for free cholic acid, hyocholic acid, α- and ω-muricholic acid (MCA), and 391.1/355.2 for β-MCA.

Transplantation assay

PARAGRAPH

Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the framework of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Sun Yat-sen University.

Six- to eight-week-old female NOD-SCID mice, weight between 20–25 g (purchased from BIOCYTOGEN) were used as recipients.

These mice were kept in individually ventilated cages under controlled light conditions (26 °C, 12 h light/12 h darkness cycle) and the mice were allowed free access to water and a dry pellet diet.

Before performing the operations, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (Sigma-Aldrich) with a dosage of 35 mg/kg.

The operation group (20 mice) were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (Sigma-Aldrich) with a dosage of 35 mg/kg.

HBOs matured in vitro for 45 days were carefully removed from the dish using tweezers, washed with cold PBS and then transplanted under the splenic capsules of the mice.

Briefly, a small left-lateral peritoneal layer incision was made to expose the spleen, a subcapsular pocket was created and the organoids were placed into the pocket.

The spleen was then returned to the peritoneal cavity and the skin was closed in a double layer.

For the sham operation group (6 mice), the manipulation was performed as per the operation group with the exception of the organoid transplantations.

At 8 weeks following engraftment, the mice were humanely euthanized and subjected to further experimentation.

No formal randomization method was used to assign animals to study groups.

However, littermate animals from a given cage were randomly assigned to experimental or control groups by a technician not involved in the study.

Blinding was not performed.

Results

PARAGRAPH

Our 3-stage approach to generate hiPSC-derived HBOs, and sequential morphological changes is outlined in Fig. 1A and B.

SECTION

Differentiation of hiPSCs into endoderm and mesoderm

PARAGRAPH

Before differentiation, we examined the pluripotency of hiPSCs at day 0 by immunofluorescence and found that more than 90% of cells co-expressed OCT4 and NANOG (Fig. 2A).

This result was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2B).

For stage I, we hypothesized that by retaining a certain proportion of mTeSR in the hepatic differentiation medium we might be able to promote endoderm formation accompanied by a small portion of mesoderm, and thereafter hepatobiliary commitment.

This hypothesis was based on the knowledge of several growth factors in mTeSR (FGF2, TGF-β and LiCl):9 (i) FGF2 can switch BMP4-induced hPSC differentiation outcome to mesendoderm;10 (ii) TGF-β plays a role in hepatic fate determination11–12 and is required in vivo for biliary specification; (iii) Lithium-induced WNT activation13 may contribute to hepatic endoderm.14

We initially treated hiPSCs with DE medium that contained various ratios of mTeSR (25% or 50% or 75%).

However, none of these conditions showed sufficient endodermal commitment by day 4, as determined by the low numbers of FOXA2-positive cells (data not shown).

We reasoned that the growth factor mediated effect might be hindered by mTeSR.

PARAGRAPH

Thus, we modified the protocol by giving a 5 h-prestimulation using DE medium only, and sequentially supplemented DE medium with mTeSR over a 4-day period (Fig. 1A).

As a result, the cells with 25% mTeSR treatment showed robust upregulation of genes associated with endoderm (FOXA2, SOX17, GATA4 and GATA6) and mesoderm (BRA, EMOS and MIXL1), along with the downregulation of genes associated with non-neural ectoderm (DLX3), neuroectoderm (SOX1), trophoblast (CDX2) and pluripotency (OCT4 and NANOG) (Fig. 2C).

Immunofluorescence at day 4 showed that more than 70% of cells co-expressed DE markers FOXA2 and SOX17, about 20% of cells expressed mesoderm marker BRA, whereas very few cells expressed ectoderm marker NESTIN (Fig. 2D).

Flow cytometry further confirmed the ratio of endodermal and mesodermal lineages (Fig. 2E).

These results indicated that such sequential treatments can lead to successful differentiation of hiPSCs into DE concomitantly with mesodermal fate.

Other concentrations of mTeSR were not used because of the poor efficacy in DE induction (Fig. S1).

SECTION

Hepatic and biliary co-differentiation

PARAGRAPH

For stage II, FGF4 plus BMP2 and HGF plus KGF were used in sequence to induce and expand the hepatoblasts based on in vivo developmental cues.15–18

A total of 25% mTeSR was maintained until the maturation stage (referred to MT+ group), given the possible role of mTeSR in promoting hepatic and biliary differentiation as described above.

The hiPSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells that without mTeSR treatment were induced in parallel and used as control (MT− group).

PARAGRAPH

Formation of liver-buds depends on transient expression of Tbx3.19

As the liver bud expands, progenitor cells downregulate Tbx3 and maintain and/or upregulate the expression of hepatic and biliary genes.20

Compared with the MT− group, the MT+ group also showed transient, although weaker, upregulation of TBX3, with the peak level at day 9, and persistent upregulation of HNF4α and AFP, thus identifying this time as the stage of hepatic specification (Fig. 3A).

Approximately 70% of cells at day 9 co-expressed HNF4α and AFP as shown by immunofluorescence (Fig. 3B).

During the subsequent 6 days, the MT+ group showed rapid upregulation of early biliary specification markers NOTCH2, SOX9, CK19 and HNF621,22 (Fig. 3C).

By day 15, all 4 genes in the MT+ group showed significantly higher expression compared to the MT− group (p <0.05, p <0.01, p <0.05 and p <0.01) (Fig. 3C).

During the same period, the expression of hepatic markers in the MT+ group was maintained (HNF4α) or continued to increase (AFP and albumin), and was overall slightly lower than that in the MT− group by day 15.

Moreover, these cells exhibited features of bipotent hepatoblasts, with the co-expression of SOX9 and AFP identified by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry at day 15 (Fig. 3D).

These results indicated that bipotent hepatoblast-like cells were generated with more biliary potential in the MT+ group than in the MT− group.

PARAGRAPH

During liver development, signals from the endothelial lineage promote liver-bud formation21,23 and guide bile duct morphogenesis.24

We thus traced mesoderm-derived endothelial lineage in our system.

Quantitative PCR analysis showed rapid upregulation of endothelial progenitor marker CD34 after day 4 and mature vascular endothelial marker CD31 after day 9 in MT+ group, but persistent low expression was observed in the MT− group over differentiation (Fig. 3E).

Confirmed by immunofluorescence, a small quantity of CD146/CD34-positive cells, and CD31-positive cells in the MT+ group could be identified as early as day 5 and day 7, respectively (Fig. 3F).

By day 15, we observed tubular structures that co-stained with CD31 and CD144 over the underlying cells, as well as the CD31-marked tubular network located across the cells.

The endothelial differentiation in our system was probably contributed by the combination of Activin A and BMP4 from the differentiation medium, and FGF2 and ascorbic acid from the mTeSR according to several studies on endothelial indcution.25–27

RNA-Seq profiling of MT+ cells revealed that the genes associated with blood vessel development, extracellular matrix organization, and liver development were highly upregulated at day 15 (ICMJE disclosure).

Taken together, these results strongly linked early hepatogenesis and underlined the contribution of 25% mTeSR to model physiologically relevant conditions.

PARAGRAPH

For stage III, we supplemented HCM with OSM and Dex, which is usually used to promote hepatic maturation.28

A progressive process of hepatic and biliary differentiation in the next 10 days was observed: hepatic cells closely gathered to be clusters (Fig. 3G); in parallel, biliary lineage cells gradually organized into NOTCH2-positive ring-like structures, and then grew into cystic and/or tubular organoids (Fig. 3F).

The continued upregulation of hepatic and biliary markers during day 15–25 supported these observations (Fig. 3A and C).

PARAGRAPH

It has been previously shown that NOTCH signaling controls bile duct morphogenesis.29

As robust upregulation of NOTCH2 was observed in the mTeSR-treated cells (Fig. 3C), we asked whether the NOTCH pathway contributed to the formation of these biliary structures.

At day 25, the expression of NOTCH2, as well as its ligand JAG1 and its downstream target HES1 were significantly increased in the presence of 25% mTeSR (all p <0.01) (Fig. 3I).

This increase in expression was reversed by NOTCH signaling inhibitor DAPT (p <0.001, p <0.001, p <0.01) (MT+ DAPT+ in Fig. 3I), resulting in a dramatic reduction in the number of biliary cysts (p <0.001) (Fig. 3J).

Consistent with this, mTeSR withdrawal from day 9 led to a constant reduction in all 3 genes (p <0.001, p <0.001, p <0.01) (MT withdrawal in Fig. 3I), with the number of cysts reduced by over a half (p <0.01) (Fig. 3J).

These results indicated that 25% mTeSR effectively activated NOTCH signaling, which was required in biliary morphogenesis in this system.

However, it seemed that there were no components in mTeSR that could directly activate the NOTCH signaling.

Given the fact that NOTCH signaling from vascular endothelial cells controls bile duct morphogenesis,29 we then investigated whether NOTCH2 was activated by the endogenous signaling from the endothelial-like cells in our system.

When the endothelial differentiation was blocked by VEGFR inhibitor SU11248, the expression of JAG1, NOTCH2 and HES1 was all decreased compared with that in the MT+ group (p <0.001, p <0.001, p <0.01) (MT+ SU11248+ in Fig. 3I).

In addition, the number of cysts reduced significantly (p <0.001) (Fig. 3J).

These results demonstrated that, signaling from hiPSC-derived endothelial-like cells effectively activated NOTCH2, which guided biliary morphogenesis.

To validate our hypothesis that TGF-β provided by 25% mTeSR contributed to biliary specification, we performed similar analyses for TGF-β signaling.

We blocked the activity of TGF-β with TGF-β inhibitor SB431542 and observed that almost no biliary cysts were formed at day 25 (p <0.0001) (see MT+ SB431542+ in Fig. 3J), which supported our hypothesis.

Taken together, these results demonstrated that the biliary specification in our system was dependent on activation of NOTCH and TGF-β signaling by 25% mTeSR.

SECTION

Hepatic and biliary maturation

PARAGRAPH

During differentiation day 25–35, we observed morphologic deterioration in both hepatic and biliary lineages, and the organoids eventually collapsed upon day 35–45 (data not shown).

In previous differentiation approaches, in vitro maturation of induced hepatocytes were accompanied by accelerated senescence with rapidly decreased function,30 which might result from the shortage of necessary nutrition and cell-to-cell interaction.

Cholesterol was required in developing mammalian cells as it is involved in lipid raft assembly and membrane rigidity maintenance, thus enabling cell membrane signaling.31–33

Moreover, cholesterol provides building blocks for the synthesis of bile acids.34

Our uniquely prepared cholesterol+ MIX, which is primarily comprised of cholesterol (15 μg/ml) and other small molecules extracted from Chinese medicine (Fig. S2).

We then supplemented HCM with cholesterol+ MIX during stage III (day 15–45) (Fig. 1A).

Upon later culture, we observed drastic hepatobiliary morphologic changes between MIX+ or MIX− groups (Fig. 4).

In MIX− group, significant cell death was observed after day 25.

The remaining hepatic cells either became flattened with multiple nuclei (e.g., polykaryons via possible endomitosis), or smaller as if they were undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 4A).

The cysts gradually shrunk, becoming small aggregates after day 35, with the number decreasing over culture (Fig. 4B).

In contrast, few cells were dead in the MIX+ group.

The hepatic cells showed normal morphology and gathered more tightly, with cystic size and number becoming larger and higher, respectively, over culture (Fig. 4C–F).

These observations led us to speculate that (i) cholesterol+ MIX might play a role in promoting the hepatic and biliary differentiation/maturation.

(ii) cholesterol+ MIX might prevent organoids from senescence.

PARAGRAPH

We then performed several analyses to check the molecular phenotype of day-45 MIX+ hepato-biliary organoids (HBOs) (Fig. 5A).

Immunofluorescence analysis identified a large hepatic cluster that consisted of HNF4α-positive hepatocyte-like cells.

These cells also expressed CYP3A4, Collagen IV, and albumin that with long tubular endothelial-like cells (marked by CD31) embedded in HBOs (Fig. 5B).

Concomitantly, the biliary cysts contained epithelial-like cells that expressed EPCAM, but not albumin (Fig. 5C).

They also expressed CFTR with typical bile duct apical–basal polarity and contained primary cilia that were identified by Ac-α-tubulin.

These results demonstrated the matured features of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes.

PARAGRAPH

To further validate the effect of MIX in promoting maturity, we examined a series of mature hepatic markers (albumin, AAT, HNF4α, CYP3A4, G6PC and TAT) and biliary markers (CFTR, SSR2, ASBT, AE2, AQP1 and GGT1) in HBO with or without MIX treatment (Fig. 5D and E).

Quantitative results showed that the upregulation of mature hepatic markers mainly occurred during day 15–35, while the upregulation of matured biliary markers occurred constantly over stage III (day15–45), suggesting that day 45 might be a good timepoint for balancing hepatic and biliary development.

It was remarkable that, up to day 45, the expression of almost all of these genes (except for AQP1) in MIX+ HBOs was significantly higher than that in MIX− HBOs, which was in line with our previous observations (Fig. 4).

Besides, we examined the expression of several P450 enzymes and found that day-45 MIX+ HBOs expressed significantly higher CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 than fetal liver, with expression of CYP2A6, CYP2B6 and CYP2D6 comparable to fetal liver (Fig. 5F).

Yet, the expression of most of P450 enzymes (except for CYP3A4) in HBOs was significantly lower than that in adult liver.

Taken together, these results, confirmed by immunofluorescence, supported the role of cholesterol+ MIX in promoting the maturation of HBOs.

PARAGRAPH

Flow cytometry of day-45 HBOs identified about 60% hepatic cells (stained by albumin) and about 32% biliary cells (stained by CK19).

The remaining 8% of the cells were not characterized further.

The proportion of matured hepatic (stained by CYP3A4) and biliary (stained by CK7) cells is about 48% and 28%, respectively (Fig. 5G).

PARAGRAPH

To examine the role of cholesterol+ MIX in anti-senescence, we performed β-Gal staining in HBOs (Fig. 6).

Phase-contrast staining images showed less β-Gal+ cells in MIX+ group than those in MIX− group for both hepatic and biliary cells during differentiation (Fig. 6A).

And the observed data showed that cholesterol+ MIX significantly slowed down the senescence of HBOs (Fig. 6B).

SECTION

Hepatobiliary organoids displayed maturated features

PARAGRAPH

To characterize the function of HBOs, a battery of assays were conducted.

PAS staining indicated a glycogen storage function of the hepatic cells (Fig. S3A).

The accumulation of fatty droplets was identified by ORO staining (Fig. S3B), indicative of lipid metabolism ability in these hepatocyte-like cells.

Moreover, the differentiated hepatocytes were capable of taking up and releasing indocyanine green (ICG) (Fig. S3C).

Then the AFP, albumin, and urea production of HBOs were assessed (Fig. 7A).

Consistent with previous results (Figs. 4 and 5), the MIX+ HBOs showed more durable secretion of albumin and urea when compared with the MIX− HBOs; and both the MIX+ HBOs showed a secretion delay by 5–10 days compared with monolayer hepatocyte-like cells in MT− MIX− group.

We then quantified albumin and urea in supernatant of day-35 MT+ MIX+ HBOs and compared this with HepG2 cells and cryopreserved adult human hepatocytes (CAH) (Fig. 7B).

The albumin and urea production in day-35 HBOs (5.59 ± 0.86 and 55.41 ± 8.84 µg/ml/day/mg protein) were comparable to those in HepG2 cells (3.47 ± 0.21 and 72.22 ± 7.37 µg/ml/day/mg protein, respectively, p <0.05 and p = 0.07), but were lower than those in CAH (12.27 ± 2.92 and 106.89 ± 15.31 µg/ml/day/mg protein, respectively; p <0.05) when normalized using protein content.

Control hiPSCs showed no production of albumin and urea.

To evaluate the function of drug metabolism in HBOs, we measured the activity and inducibility of CYP3A4, which mediates the clearance of more than 50% of currently known drugs.

Using bioluminescence-based substrates (Promega), CYP3A4 activity in MIX+ HBOs moderately improved over time, reaching the peak of 0.19 ± 0.04 relative light unit/ml/day/mg protein at day 45 of differentiation, comparable to 0.23 × 10 relative light unit/ml/day/mg protein for CAH (Fig. 7C).

In contrast, the CYP3A4 activity in MIX− HBOs dramatically decreased after day 35.

Control HepG2 cells showed little CYP3A4 activity.

When dosing with either phenobarbital or rifampin (Fig. 7D), day-45 MIX+ HBO demonstrated statistically significant induction (over DMSO-treated control by 1.3–2.7-fold and 1.4–2.8-fold, p <0.05 and p <0.05, respectively); whereas CAH was more robustly induced (1.9–3.3-fold and 2.7–5.5-fold, p <0.01 and p <0.05, respectively).

PARAGRAPH

The secretory potential of cystic structures was confirmed with rhodamine 123, a fluorescent dye used to assess the activity of the multidrug resistance protein-1 (MDR1) in cholangiocytes.35

As the dye was actively secreted to the luminal space of cysts, the accumulation was prevented by the MDR1 inhibitor verapamil (Fig. 7E), thus it was used to confirm the MDR1-dependent transporter activity.

Moreover, day-45 MIX+ HBOs displayed greater GGT activity compared with intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells (p <0.05), and about 10-fold greater activity than MIX− HBOs, respectively (p <0.001) (Fig. 7F).

Notably, bile acid was identified in the lumen of day-45 cyst structures (Fig. 7G), suggesting that the bile acid produced by hepatocytes was transported from bile duct structures to cysts.

Taken together, these results indicated that the differentiated hepatocyte-like cells and cholangiocyte-like cells in HBOs had gradually become functionally mature.

Potential of HBO for in vivo use

PARAGRAPH

To investigate the potential of HBOs for in vivo use, we transplanted HBOs under the splenic capsule of NOD-SCID immune-deficient mice (n = 20) (Fig. 8A).36,37

Sham operation was performed as control (n = 6).

At 4 weeks after transplantation, we identified biliary duct-like structures that stained positive for hCK19 (Fig. 8B), and large hepatic clusters that stained positive for human albumin (Fig. 8C).

Little staining was detected in sham-operated spleens confirming the specificity of antibodies.

At 8 weeks after transplantation, the biliary structures were well maintained, which was demonstrated by the appearance of hCFTR/Ac-α-tubulin staining with apical–basal polarity (Fig. 8D).

But the hepatic structure was not well maintained at 8 weeks, with less human albumin-positive cells identified than in grafts obtained at 4 weeks after transplantation (Fig. 8E).

We then found that many of these hepatic cells were in the livers of mice (Fig. 8F).

Quantitative results supported these immunofluorescence findings (Fig. 8G).

PARAGRAPH

Teratomas were not found in any of the animals receiving transplants, and the expression of pluripotency markers NANOG and OCT4 was much lower in HBO in vivo (8 weeks) than in adult liver (Fig. 8G).

PARAGRAPH

In order to verify these results, we repeatedly induced HBOs with H1 human ES cell lines and iPSC WD lines and obtained the same results consistently (Fig. S4-5).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

For liver modeling in vitro, morphologic and functional maturity has been hampered by the difficulty in mimicking the cellular microenvironment during embryogenesis, that is, the interaction and co-development of various progenitors from multiple germ layers.38

Given the critical role of mesodermal signals in hepatobiliary development, under the premise of hepatic endoderm differentiation committed by hepatic differentiation mediums, we simultaneously initiated mesodermal differentiation by including 25% mTeSR medium into the protocol, which is one of our key factors in this study.

As differentiation proceeded, we observed hepatic, biliary and endothelial differentiation, and obtained HBOs within 4 weeks.

Then 10% cholesterol+ MIX was utilized to further promote the in vitro maturation of HBOs.

This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, to report successful in vitro generation of hiPSC-derived 3D functional HBOs, without the need for exogenous cells or genetic manipulation.

PARAGRAPH

The concomitant differentiation of hepatic and biliary lineage in this system to some extent recapitulated several key aspects of early hepatogenesis in vivo, including the generation of hepatoblast-like cells and vascular endothelial-like cells, specification of hepatoblast-like cells to hepatocyte and cholangiocyte fate, then the induction and formation of more differentiated hepatocyte-like cells with cystic and tubular structures.

PARAGRAPH

Furthermore, similar to the biliary tubulogenesis in mice, our gain and loss of function analyses demonstrated that the biliary specification in this system was probably co-guided by NOTCH signaling that activated by mesoderm-derived endothelial-like cells, and TGF-β signaling enhanced by mTeSR.

These results confirmed the indirect and direct roles of mTeSR in promoting biliary commitment in this system, as well as demonstrating the importance of NOTCH and TGF-β signaling pathways in human cholangiocyte specification.

Paralleled with biliary specification, hepatic specification was concomitantly induced.

We found the expression of hepatic specific markers in cultures was mildly suppressed compared to the protocol without mTeSR treatment, which might be at the expense of enhanced NOTCH and TGF-β signaling.

This led to the delay in AFP/albumin/urea secretion for several days.

Nevertheless, a switch from AFP to albumin was also observed in this system, which is one of the stress signs for hepatocyte maturation.

By the end of stage (day 45), the HBO was mostly comprised of about 60% hepatocyte-like cells and about 30% cholangiocyte-like cells.

PARAGRAPH

It is important to assess the maturity of HBOs.

The typical bile duct apical–basal polarity of matured biliary markers, the presence of primary cilia, together with the ability to transport rhodamine and store bile acid demonstrated a mature phenotype of biliary cells in HBOs.

Notably, the HBO displayed more GGT activity than human intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells.

Meanwhile, the induced hepatocyte-like cells could take up ICG, store glycogen and accumulate liquid.

Expression of P450, the capacity of albumin and urea secretion, CYP3A4 activity and its inductivity in HBOs consistently identified an intermediate maturity between fetal liver and adult liver.

PARAGRAPH

An important aspect of this hepatobiliary system is that there is no requirement for exogenous supportive cells (such as mesenchymal stem cells and fibroblasts),39–40 liver extracellular matrices8 or specialized biomaterials,41,42 thus reducing the experimental variability, costs, and most importantly, the risk of immune-rejection for future transplantation applications.

PARAGRAPH

Recently, liver organoids with biliary structures have been generated by co-culturing with extracellular matrix scaffolds and fetal progenitor cells obtained from human liver tissue.8

However, human liver tissues are very limited given the scarce availability of suitable donors, and their quality for in vitro use varies considerably across different cell types.

By contrast, hiPSCs can easily be produced from readily accessible cell types, and hold greater potential to be translated into clinical applications.43

More importantly, the pattern of producing an organ totally through endogenous cell culture, as shown in our study, is closer to the authentic conditions in vivo, thus highlighting the value for future drug development and potential liver transplantation.

PARAGRAPH

To achieve a more matured function of HBOs, it is possible to optimize the current hepatobiliary system based on several considerations: (i) Endogenous signal: the ratio of endoderm and mesoderm might be further optimized by modification of mTeSR concentrations during stage I and II.

(ii) Exogenous signal: differentiation studies have underlined the roles of several specific molecules in directing hiPSC-derived hepatoblast-like cells to cholangiocyte-like cells (e.g. Activin A, FGF-10 and retinoic acid for TGF-β mediated biliary specification; JAGGED and NOTCH2 for NOTCH pathway mediated tubular morphogenesis).44–46

Thus, including one or more of these molecules into the current protocol might be useful to enhance the functional of biliary lineage cells in HBO.

(iii) Structural support: ECM support has been shown to be critical for in vitro hepatic maintenance and differentiation.

In this regard, laminin 521/111-based hepatocyte-like cells from hiPSCs were recently reported to achieve higher P450 activity and more robust inducibility compared with those differentiated on Matrigel.

Moreover, this matrix also better supported bile canaliculi-like structures in culture.

Therefore, laminin matrix seems to be a good candidate for hepatobiliary co-differentiation.

Lastly, a 3D approach (e.g. matrix overlay) could be attempted to promote maturity by reinforcing the structure and facilitating cellular interactions.45

PARAGRAPH

In general, this hepatobiliary system can serve as a tool for developmental and pathological research in the liver, offering more potential to accurately predict drug metabolism and toxicity in future drug development.

Besides, the system described herein has enormous therapeutic potential for hepatobiliary system transplantation in end-stage liver failure.
