TITLE

Generation of hepatobiliary organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells

PARAGRAPH

Herein, we established a system to generate human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived functional hepatobiliary organoids in vitro, without any exogenous cells or genetic manipulation.

To some extent this model was able to recapitulate several key aspects of hepatobiliary organogenesis in a parallel fashion, holding great promise for drug development and liver transplantation.
