TITLE

Efficacy of annexin A3 blockade in sensitizing hepatocellular carcinoma to sorafenib and regorafenib

PARAGRAPH

This study represents the most extensive pre-clinical characterization of anti-ANXA3 monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma to date.

These results support the clinical trial development of anti-ANXA3 antibodies in combination with sorafenib/regorafenib.

Further studies will optimize patient target selection and identify the best treatment combinations.
