TITLE

Hip fracture risk in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis: A population-based study using English and Danish data

PARAGRAPH

Alcoholic cirrhosis creates a large public health burden and is a risk factor for bone fractures.

Based on data from England and Denmark, we found that hip fractures occur more than five times more frequently in people with alcoholic cirrhosis than in people without the disease.

Additionally, the aftermath of the hip fracture is severe, such that up to 11% of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis die within 30â€¯days after their hip fracture.

These results suggest that efforts directed towards fracture prevention in people with alcoholic cirrhosis could be beneficial.
