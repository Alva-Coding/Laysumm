Circular RNA cSMARCA5 inhibits growth and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma

PARAGRAPH

Herein, we studied the role of cSMARCA5, a circular RNA, in hepatocellular carcinoma.

Our in vitro and in vivo data showed that cSMARCA5 inhibits the growth and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, making it a potential therapeutic target.
