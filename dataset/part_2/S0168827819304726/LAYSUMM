TITLE

Impact of combined selective internal radiation therapy and sorafenib on survival in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma

PARAGRAPH

Sorafenib given orally is the recommended treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

In selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), also known as radioembolisation, microscopic, radioactive resin or glass spheres are introduced into the blood vessels that feed the tumours in the liver.

This study found that the addition of SIRT with 90yttrium-loaded resin microspheres to sorafenib treatment in people with advanced HCC did not significantly improve overall survival compared with sorafenib treatment alone.

However, the results give an indication of how future studies using this combination therapy in people with advanced HCC could be designed.
