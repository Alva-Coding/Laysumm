ABSTRACT

TITLE

The beneficial effects of Mediterranean diet over low-fat diet may be mediated by decreasing hepatic fat content

PARAGRAPH

It is unclear if a reduction in hepatic fat content (HFC) is a major mediator of the cardiometabolic benefit of lifestyle intervention, and whether it has prognostic significance beyond the loss of visceral adipose tissue (VAT).

In the present sub-study, we hypothesized that HFC loss in response to dietary interventions induces specific beneficial effects independently of VAT changes.

PARAGRAPH

In an 18-month weight-loss trial, 278 participants with abdominal obesity/dyslipidemia were randomized to low-fat (LF) or Mediterranean/low-carbohydrate (MED/LC + 28 g walnuts/day) diets with/without moderate physical activity.

HFC and abdominal fat-depots were measured using magnetic resonance imaging at baseline, after 6 (sub-study, n = 158) and 18 months.

PARAGRAPH

Of 278 participants (mean HFC 10.2% [range: 0.01%–50.4%]), the retention rate was 86.3%.

The %HFC substantially decreased after 6 months (−6.6% absolute units [−41% relatively]) and 18 months (−4.0% absolute units [−29% relatively]; p <0.001 vs. baseline).

Reductions of HFC were associated with decreases in VAT beyond weight loss.

After controlling for VAT loss, decreased %HFC remained independently associated with reductions in serum gamma glutamyltransferase and alanine aminotransferase, circulating chemerin, and glycated hemoglobin (p <0.05).

While the reduction in HFC was similar between physical activity groups, MED/LC induced a greater %HFC decrease (p = 0.036) and greater improvements in cardiometabolic risk parameters (p <0.05) than the LF diet, even after controlling for VAT changes.

Yet, the greater improvements in cardiometabolic risk parameters induced by MED/LC were all markedly attenuated when controlling for HFC changes.

PARAGRAPH

%HFC is substantially reduced by diet-induced moderate weight loss and is more effectively reduced by the MED/LC diet than the LF diet, independently of VAT changes.

The beneficial effects of the MED/LC diet on specific cardiometabolic parameters appear to be mediated more by decreases in %HFC than VAT loss.
