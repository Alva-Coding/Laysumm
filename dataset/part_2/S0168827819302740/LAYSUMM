TITLE

The beneficial effects of Mediterranean diet over low-fat diet may be mediated by decreasing hepatic fat content

PARAGRAPH

High hepatic fat content is associated with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease.

In the CENTRAL 18-month intervention trial, a Mediterranean/low-carbohydrate diet induced a greater decrease in hepatic fat content than a low-fat diet, conferring beneficial health effects that were beyond the favorable effects of visceral fat loss.
