TITLE

Ex vivo liver resection and autotransplantation as alternative to allotransplantation for end-stage hepatic alveolar echinococcosis

PARAGRAPH

Ex vivo liver resection and autotransplantation were performed in a large series of patients with end-stage hepatic alveolar echinococcosis.

The results showed that this surgical option was feasible, with acceptable postoperative mortality, but 100% disease-free survival in survivors.

Careful patient selection, as well as precise assessment for size and quality of the remnant liver are key to successful surgery.
