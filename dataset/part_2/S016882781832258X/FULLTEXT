TITLE

Ex vivo liver resection and autotransplantation as alternative to allotransplantation for end-stage hepatic alveolar echinococcosis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatic alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a lethal infectious disease caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus multilocularis (E. multilocularis).

This severe disease remains a major public health issue in pastoral areas in China, Turkey, Central Asia, the Mediterranean and some European countries.1

AE is usually chronic and asymptomatic while primary hepatic involvement presents with a mortality rate of 75% to 90% after 10 to 15 years if untreated.

So far surgery associated with albendazole medication has been considered a major radical procedure for clinically diagnosed patients with AE.

Of note, in late diagnosed cases, very few patients can benefit from surgery, due to extensive disease progression.2

Retrospective studies have shown that palliative surgical procedures should be avoided in such cases, and the only feasible treatment is the long-term use of oral benzimidazoles.3

Nevertheless, lifelong medications and their major potential side effects and the numerous complications of palliative resections with endless biliary drainage have motivated more radical approaches.4

Given the devastating complications of AE and the limited surgical options available in advanced cases, transplantations emerged as an option for both curative and often palliative care.

Although it was presented as a legitimate approach, the need for an organ donor is a limitation and lifelong immuno-suppressants increase the risk of recurrence.

For these reasons, the decision to proceed to transplantation should be considered extremely cautiously.5

PARAGRAPH

In 1988, ex vivo liver resection followed by autotransplantation technique (ELRA) was firstly introduced by Pichlmayr as a radical procedure for conventionally unresectable tumors in cases where transplantation as questionable.

This very advanced situation is analogous to that commonly seen in patients with end-stage hepatic AE.6

Unlike allotransplantation, ELRA requires neither an organ donor nor immunosuppressive agents.

With the high incidence of advanced AE in the Central Asia region, it was decided to use ELRA in non-operable cases with encouraging results in the first 15 cases.7

The main advantage of ELRA was the possibility to treat very advanced, in principle non-operable cases, without any need for an organ donor or postoperative immunosuppressive agent.

As large scale studies are still missing, the aim of the present study was to report a large series on ELRA with 69 consecutive patients with end-stage hepatic AE.

The goal was to propose possible indications and selection criteria to discuss safety, feasibility and efficacy of this “orphan” and “promising” surgical technique.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Ethics

PARAGRAPH

The study design and management of patients were in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration 1975 and approved by the Human Ethics Committee of first author’s institution.

Written informed consents were obtained from all subjects and/or legal custodians.

SECTION

Patients

PARAGRAPH

From January 2010 to February 2017, 300 patients with hepatic AE underwent surgical resections at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University.

Among them, 69 (23%, 69/300) needed ELRA, while others could be treated by conventional hepatic resection.

Resectability and operability were carefully assessed by a multi-disciplinary team including hepatobiliary surgeons, hepatologists, interventional therapists, radiologists, and anesthesiologists.

Patient selection and treatment options, as shown in Fig. 1, were strictly followed.

Unresectability for conventional hepatic surgery was defined as extensive hepatocaval involvement along the three hepatic veins, and retrohepatic vena cava (RHVC) involvement with or without tertiary vascular branche involvement.

In these advanced situations, a conventional resection would induce uncontrollable bleeding and irreversible ischemic injury due to the need for intensive vascular preparation and parenchymal resection.

PARAGRAPH

Of note, during the study period only three patients received allotransplantation due to a disseminated AE lesion with end-stage biliary cirrhosis in one case, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and insufficient residual liver volume.

These three patients were excluded from the present study.

SECTION

Preoperative assessment

PARAGRAPH

Preoperative thoraco-abdominal computed tomography (CT), liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and all-body-positron-emission tomography (PET) were systematically used to assess the site and size of lesions, as well as the parenchymal, vascular and biliary extension and extrahepatic metastasis.

Preoperative volumetric calculation was achieved by using 3D visualization imaging.

Patients were categorized by disease status according to World Health Organization (WHO) PNM classification8 Doppler ultrasound of jugular and greater saphenous veins were examined as potential vascular substitutes.

Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was considered to confirm the existence of tangible collateral circulation when total obliteration of RHVC was indicated by imaging studies (Fig. 2).

PARAGRAPH

Unresectability for conventional hepatic surgery was considered when the hepatocaval region along with three hepatic veins and RHVC were involved or when the tertiary branches of portal veins and arteries were invaded, and thus required a complex reconstruction with long ischemic time.

ELRA was indicated based on precise anatomic and functional criteria: extensive AE lesions with hepato-caval confluence and involvement of three hepatic veins; involvement of up to tertiary portal and arterial branches requiring critical reconstruction; patients with graft volume ≥40% of estimated standard liver volume (ESLV); patients with total bilirubin level higher than twice the upper limit of normal value (≤60 μmol/L); routine percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage (PTCD) performed in cases with obstructive jaundice.

The contraindications to ELRA were: hepatic congestion with Budd-Chiari syndrome and patients with multi-organ AE, although this was a relative contraindication if extrahepatic lesions were controllable with albendazole.

Of note, such procedures are only possible with available expertise in liver transplantation, in case allo-transplantation rescue is required.

SECTION

Preoperative interventional therapies

PARAGRAPH

PTCD and/or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were performed when preoperative obstructive jaundice was manifested.

The threshold level of total bilirubin for intervention was set as 60 μmol/L.

In individuals with future liver remnant (FLR) to standard liver volume (SLV) ratio (FLR/SLV) lower than 30%, selective portal vein embolization (PVE) was considered in order to prevent postoperative hepatic failure.

SECTION

Albendazole

PARAGRAPH

Preoperatively some patients received albendazole in their initial hospital prior to referral to our tertiary center (see Table 2).

All patients were put under albendazole postoperatively for two years as recommended.9

SECTION

Types of graft

PARAGRAPH

Based on preoperative assessment for surgical planning, the autograft was categorized, regarding its anatomical site within the liver, as Type I (left lateral), Type II (right posterior lobe), Type III (Right), Type IV (left medial), Type V (left lateral + right posterior).

SECTION

Surgery

SECTION

On-table resection

PARAGRAPH

After accessing the abdomen, the presence of any extrahepatic lesions was carefully ruled out and the presence of intrahepatic micro lesions assessed by intraoperative ultrasound.

Subsequently, dense adhesions caused by AE lesions were carefully released and hilar soft tissues and surrounding lymph nodes resected.10

Afterwards, en bloc resection of the entire liver together with RHVC was performed.

If the diaphragm was also involved, local resection was performed.

All specimens were sent for pathological examination.

SECTION

Hemodynamic stability during anhepatic phase

PARAGRAPH

After total liver and vena cava resection, two surgical teams started bench resection and intra-abdominal temporary vascular reconstruction, respectively.

For the anhepatic phase, when necessary (poor hemodynamic tolerance) a Gore-Tex prosthetic graft was interposed to reconstruct the vena cava with or without additional porto-systemic shunt.

In selected cases, the graft was then left in place for the reconstruction.

The detailed pattern approaches and possible indications are shown (Fig. 3).

SECTION

Ex vivo resection

PARAGRAPH

Hypothermic perfusion via intact portal vein was started immediately after liver resection.

Organ preservation solution applied were University Wisconsin (UW) solution in the 38 first cases, histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution in the further 31 cases.

Extended hepatectomy was carried out based on the type of possible future grafts.

Both cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator and bipolar electric cautery were used for parenchymal dissection.

RHVCs were peeled off as long as possible for further reconstruction.

A safe margin was guaranteed with negative pathology confirmed by repeated frozen section.

The AE lesion and graft were weighed separately.

Defects of RHVC, hepatic veins, and portal vein were patched and/or bridged using venous substitutes.

Finally, any potential leaks were carefully detected via repeated organ perfusion and sutured before implantation.

SECTION

Autotransplantation

PARAGRAPH

Once the graft preparation was completed, IVC prosthetics were removed and porto-systemic shunts discontinued for the implantation process.

The detailed reconstruction patterns of hepatic vein, portal vein, artery and biliary tracts are displayed (Table 1).

SECTION

Postoperative management and follow-up

PARAGRAPH

Postoperative complications were assessed based on the Clavien classification.11

During the early postoperative days, patients with prosthetic graft left in situ were given standard prophylactic anticoagulant and anti-aggregant agents.

Subjects were submitted to standard postoperative albendazole treatment for two years as recommended in the literature.9

The liver function test, serological test, ultrasonography, CT, and PET scans were performed to assess the size and quality of the graft, as well as possible recurrence, if any.

SECTION

Statistics

PARAGRAPH

Results were given as median values with range, and Student’s t test was used when necessary, p values <0.05 were considered significant.

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

Ex vivo extended hepatectomy with autotransplantation was performed successful in all 69 patients.

The baseline characteristics of the cohort are displayed (Table 2).

PARAGRAPH

The median weight of the graft and AE lesion were 850 (370–1,600) g and 1,650 (375–5,000) g, respectively.

The graft mass and SLV (GM/SLM) ratio ranged from 37 to 125% with a median of 72%.

The median duration of the operation and anhepatic phase were 15.9 [8–24] h and 360 [104–879] min, respectively.

All but six patients needed a blood transfusion.

The median amount of blood loss and transfused red blood cells were 1,000 (400–15,000) ml and 5 (0–32.5) units, respectively, as shown (Table 3).

Additional surgeries were performed when necessary to achieve radical resection and included phrenectomy (n = 12), lung lobectomy (inferior right lobe) (n = 5), nephrectomy (n = 2) and various other resections, as indicated (cardiac sac resection for example [see Table 3]).

Lung resection was only performed when the AE lesion was localized in the lower lobe.

PARAGRAPH

The intraoperative mortality was zero.

The most frequent postoperative complication was pleural effusion in 18 patients (26%).

Complications higher than Clavien IIIa were observed in 10 patients (14%).

The 30-day mortality was 7.24% (5/69) and a further three patients died within 90 days, giving an overall mortality of 11.5% (8/69).

The causes of mortality were liver failure in 5/8 patients, septic shock in 2/8 patients, and postoperative intra-abdominal bleeding in 1/8 patients (see Table 4).

Postoperative pathology showed no secondary biliary cirrhosis but fibrosis in all patients.

Patients who died postoperatively compared to survivors had no differences regarding GM/SLM ratio (76% vs. 71%, p = 0.48), but a trend for longer surgical (18 h vs. 16 h, p = 0.127) and longer anhepatic duration (412 min vs. 368 min, p = 0.37).

Nevertheless, intraoperative blood loss (5,050 ml vs. 1,465 ml, p = 0.0001) and blood transfusions (17 units vs. 6 units, p = 0.0001) were higher in deceased patients.

PARAGRAPH

The median follow-up in 60 surviving patients was 22.5 months [14–89].

The deceased patients were excluded and one single patient was lost to follow-up.

In five patients, the vena cava did not need to be reconstructed because of rich collateral circulation.

Of note, in these patients neither lower extremities edema nor renal dysfunction were observed.

PARAGRAPH

The postoperative vascular patency (vena cava with hepatic veins, hepatic artery and, portal vein) was assessed systematically and confirmed by CT scan in all patients.

The five-year (n = 3), four-year (n = 10), three-year (n = 14), two-year (n = 20), and one-year (n = 31) disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 100%.

PARAGRAPH

For comparison, and despite different indications and surgery, the outcomes of the 228 hepatic AE patients treated during the study period by conventional liver resection were: 90-day mortality 3%, recurrence rate 2%.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

To the best of our knowledge, the present study analyzes the largest series of ex vivo liver resection with autotransplantation in end-stage hepatic AE.

The revival of this challenging technique initially used in oncologic liver surgery may represent an interesting alternative to transplantation or palliative albendazole in AE.

However, careful patient selection, precise indications and adequate assessment of the size and quality of future remnant liver are key to successful management.

PARAGRAPH

Hepatic AE is an often neglected but lethal disease, especially in developing countries, which should be managed in specialized centers.12

Surgery associated with albendazole is the best curative option, especially in advanced cases.13

Nevertheless, resection was not considered possible in about 25% of patients with AE treated in our center.

In rural and pastoral regions like Central Asia, patients are diagnosed rather late (patient delay, doctor delay, large distances to specialized centers etc.), which explains the large number of advanced cases in the present study.

To date, for these advanced cases, either albendazole (with or without palliative surgery), or allotransplantation might be considered.

In fact, although long-term albendazole administration was found to be safer, clinical outcome is poor with five-year survival between 10% and 40%.14

In patients with nonresectable AE, long-term administration of albendazole can reduce the mortality to <20%, however, this is costly and could have side effects in 5–10% patients.

Albendazole is also potentially teratogenic, meaning oral contraception is required for women of child-bearing age.15,16

In our previous cohort with 12 end-stage patients who received albendazole treatment alone, only five patients were stable with the treatment, and five needed liver resection, one liver transplantation and the other one PTCD due to a biliary complication.17

PARAGRAPH

Until recently, allotransplantation was considered the last resource in AE, with a reported five-year survival of up to 70%.

Nevertheless, transplantation in AE is controversial because of the inherent limitations of transplantation (organ shortage, absence of adequate model for end-stage liver disease scores in patients with AE) and relatively high postoperative recurrence due to immunosuppressive treatment.18

Thus, indications for allotransplantation in AE have decreased dramatically over the last few years, as confirmed by the fact that only three patients needed allotransplantation in our series and are excluded from the present analysis.

PARAGRAPH

The surgical treatment for end-stage hepatic AE reported in the present study was ELRA, with the benefit of requiring neither an organ donor nor postoperative immunosuppressive agents, the main cause of disease recurrence.

In this series, the postoperative mortality was comparable to allotransplantation, but the clinical outcome was better.

Although their data were heterochronic, Koch et al. reported five-year survival rates of 71%, with a five-year DFS of 58%.

The early deaths reported were mostly related to bacterial or fungal infections, in patients in poor condition at the time liver transplantation was performed.18

In comparison to this historical large cohort on transplantation, the results of the present study on ELRA displayed lower postoperative mortality and better survival despite shorter follow-up.

PARAGRAPH

During a 10-year experience in our center with more than 500 hepatic AE cases, it could be observed that the parasitic lesion presented a unique “retrograde” growth pattern with mainly hepatocaval invasion and secondary and/or tertiary vasculatures (including biliary tree), growing through the portal vein branches.

During the period of AE growth, portal flow in diseased liver is diminished and compensatory portal inflow in normal liver is increased.

The chronic hypoperfusion of the side of the liver involved, induces an hypertrophy of the contralateral hepatic parenchyma similar to the hypertrophy observed after PVE.7,19

This was confirmed in the present study by a median GM/SLM ratio of 72%, significantly higher than the typical 30% threshold.

For this reason, autografts in the present study were categorized based on their anatomical segments from Type I to V.

In the present series, 54 cases were Type I (left lateral).

This might be explained by the high angle between the portal trunk and sagittal section of the left portal vein that may bar the parasite from the left lateral lobe.

PARAGRAPH

The management of preoperative biliary obstruction and intraoperative vascular reconstruction are two major strategic challenges.

In the current study, 15 out of 69 cases presented with obstructive jaundice requiring biliary drainage prior to ELRA.

Postoperative pathology showed no secondary biliary cirrhosis but fibrosis in all patients.

Individual management of the anhepatic phase as well as vascular reconstruction were challenging.

In the historical ELRA, veno-venous bypass (VVB) was used routinely to control hemodynamic stability during the anhepatic phase.6,20,21

However, complications such as pulmonary thromboembolism or post-reperfusion syndrome were reported in up to 30% of cases.22

In 2006, the first patient with ELRA performed for cholangiocarcinoma in China developed a mental disorder after VVB.23

This clinical case and further experimental study showed that temporary vena cava reconstruction and additional porto-systemic shunt were safer and more effective for maintaining hemodynamic stability during a long anhepatic phase.7,24

Because of the slow growth of the AE lesion and chronic compression or even obliteration of the vena cava, extensive rich collateral vascularization developed.25

PARAGRAPH

Postoperative hepatic failure remains the major life-threatening complication after ELRA.26,27

In the present series, the mortality due to liver failure may be explained by prolonged ischemic time due to complex vascular reconstruction and massive intraoperative bleeding due to extensive adhesions.

This makes patient selection and the precise indication crucial to the management of end-stage AE.

All patients in the present study who died of liver failure were Child-Pugh B. However, 10 patients with Child-Pugh B survived.

So unfortunately, despite caution in those patients, with adequate measured FLR and preoperative jaundice reduction, this study cannot display clear exclusion criteria for the patients that meet the surgical indication criteria displayed (Fig. 1).

For this reason, patients with end-stage AE and compromised hepatic quality, due to chronic obstruction of hepatic vein without compensatory collateral circulations, should be cautiously considered for surgery.

PARAGRAPH

This study has some limitations that need to be addressed.

Firstly, this study reports the experience of a highly specialized AE center in Central Asia, with a selection of patients from rural and pastoral regions, thus explaining the high number of very advanced late diagnosed cases.

ELRA was initially developed for advanced cancer, but as AE behave locally like an invasive cancer, the use of ELRA represents a logical extension of the indications for AE.

In these advanced cases with reduced liver function, albendazole alone may not be a valuable option.

Finally, the long-term postoperative mortality with liver failure may be regarded as high compared to current mortality after liver resection or liver transplantation.

However, the AE end-stage disease has such a poor prognosis without treatment that the risks taken, provided they are honestly and adequately discussed with the patients, are worth it, with 100% DFS in survivors.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, the present large series of ELRA in patients with end-stage hepatic AE, describe a feasible surgical option with an acceptable postoperative mortality of 12%, but 100% DFS in survivors.

Careful patient selection, as well as precise assessment for size and quality of remnant liver are key to successful surgery.

Further cohorts with high patient numbers and longer follow-up are important to confirm the results of the present study.
