TITLE

Inactivation of caspase 8 in liver parenchymal cells confers protection against murine obstructive cholestasis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Cholestasis refers to a decrease in bile flow due to impaired secretion by hepatocytes or obstruction of the intra- or extrahepatic bile ducts.

In humans, the most prominent disease is biliary obstruction of the common bile duct by gallstones.

Other diseases include primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis or biliary atresia.

Experimental surgical ligation of the common bile duct (BDL) is the standard experimental model of obstructive cholestatic injury.1

BDL causes complete biliary obstruction and accumulation of toxic bile acids in liver and serum as observed in patients.

Although this model has shed some light on the mechanisms leading to hepatocellular injury, treatment options especially for non-obstructive cholestatic liver injury need to be improved.

PARAGRAPH

Apoptosis and necroptosis are complementary pathways controlled by common signaling adaptors, kinases and proteases.2

In fact, studies using FasR-, TNF-R1- or TRAIL-deficient mice have shown protection against cholestatic liver injury, strongly supporting a mechanistic role for death receptor family members in obstructive cholestasis.3

PARAGRAPH

Caspase 8 (CASP8), a cystein-aspartate protease, is the apical initiator caspase in death receptor-mediated apoptosis and constitutively expressed as a premature zymogen.

After death receptor activation by its cognate ligand, the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex consisting of a death receptor, the adaptor protein Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), and pro-CASP8 is induced leading to activation of CASP8 by an autocatalytic process.4

CASP8 can, in turn, activate downstream effector caspases such as caspase 3 (CASP3) or – as in hepatocytes – activate intrinsic pro-apoptotic pathways.5

Alternatively, necroptosis is a caspase-independent form of cell death triggered by activating receptor interacting kinase 3 (RIPK3) which requires the pseudokinase MLKL.6

PARAGRAPH

Hence, in the present study we tested our hypothesis that CASP8 might be a potential pharmacologic target for cholestatic liver disease.

We show that targeting CASP8 in liver parenchymal cells (LPCs), but not general CASP8 inhibition, is an interesting treatment option for obstructive cholestasis.

Material and methods

SECTION

Human patients

PARAGRAPH

Data was obtained from a cohort of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PBC from a tertiary care center in Mexico City (Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición “Salvador Zubirán”).

Plasma and serum samples were collected from each patient in the morning after a 6 h fasting period; for this, written informed consent was obtained from each patient.

The study was approved by the local ethics committee (Approval No.: GAS-460-11/12-1) and was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki.

Serum was used to determine routine biochemical data and plasma aliquots were processed and stored at −80 °C until cytokine determination was performed.

IL-6 and TNF-α (Bio legend, Inc.

San Diego CA) were all measured by means of ELISA, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

All tests were run in duplicate.

The clinical and biochemical data from these 28 patients is shown (Table 1).

Liver biopsies were obtained from patients with confirmed diagnosis of PBC from the Department of Internal Medicine III of the University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Germany.

SECTION

Animal experimentation

PARAGRAPH

To study the role of CASP8 in obstructive cholestasis, we generated hepatocyte-specific Casp8 knockout mice (Casp8Δhepa).

For this purpose, mice carrying loxP‐site‐flanked (floxed) alleles of the Casp8 gene28 were crossed to either Alfp‐cre or Alb-cre transgenic mice, as previously described.4,16

In all experiments, littermates carrying the respective loxP-flanked alleles but lacking expression of Cre recombinase were used as wild-type controls.

Mice were bred on a C57BL/6 genetic background.

Ripk3+/+ and Ripk3−/− knockout mice bred in the same background were also included (described in29).

Mice were housed in 12 h light/dark cycles, with free access to food and water and were treated in accordance with the criteria of the Spanish and German administrative panels on laboratory animal care and approved by the local Animal Care Committees (#AZ84-02.04.2013.

A184 and PROEX 195/16, respectively).

SECTION

Bile duct ligation and treatments

PARAGRAPH

Male 8–10-week-old mice were anaesthetised with i.p. injection of narcotisation-solution (0.01% xylazin hydrochloride/1% ketamine hydrochloride mixture, diluted in 0.9% NaCl) in a concentration of 100 μl/10 g body weight and subjected to BDL.

After midline laparotomy, the common bile duct was exposed and twice ligated with 6–0 silk suture.

A small incision was used between both ligatures to ensure blocking of the bile duct.

Sham operation was performed by gently touching the bile duct.

The abdominal musculature and skin were closed with an absorbable suture by a continuous fissure.

Subsequently, mice received 0.1 mg/kg Buprenorphine® i.m. to avoid pain-induced stress.

PARAGRAPH

Pan-caspase inhibition was administered on a daily basis by oral gavage in a dose of 3 mg/kg IDN-7314 (Conatus Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA, USA), dissolved in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC).

IDN-7314 has been tested to inhibit the activity of caspase 1 (CASP1) (IC50 = 0.222 nM), CASP3 (IC50 = 5.38 nM), CASP8 (IC50 = 0.138 nM) and caspase 9 (CASP9) (IC50 = 2.08 nM).

Control mice were subjected to BDL and administered the solvent (CMC).

Nec-1 (0.6 mg/20 g body weight; Sigma–Aldrich, Taufkichen, Germany) was administered i.p. on a daily basis.

Control mice were given an injection of 35% polyethylene glycol-400 (PEG-400).

Upon sacrifice, blood, liver and spleens were harvested.

Results

SECTION

Advanced PBC in patients is associated with activation of CASP8

PARAGRAPH

PBC is the most common liver disease associated with chronic cholestasis in adults.

A total of 28 patients with PBC, 6 males (21.4%) and 22 females (78.6%) were included in this analysis.

Patients with PBC suffered from typical symptoms i.e. fatigue and pruritus.

Biochemical markers showed signs of cholestasis as evidenced by high levels of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase, but also increased serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and cholesterol (Table 1).

PBC progresses from inflammation to cirrhosis characterized by considerable cell death of hepatocytes.

Indeed, patients with PBC elicited increased TNFα and IL-6 protein levels compared to healthy patients (Table 1).

Thus, we investigated markers of apoptosis and necroptosis and compared liver biopsies from advanced PBC (stage IV) with those of healthy patients.

Interestingly, cleaved CASP3 and CASP8, as well as RIPK3 were highly expressed in the livers of patients with PBC (Fig. 1), indicating that the death receptor (DR)-signaling pathway is involved in cholestatic liver disease.

SECTION

Loss of CASP8 in LPCs in the BDL model of acute and chronic cholestasis

PARAGRAPH

Since CASP8 expression is increased in the liver of patients with PBC, we investigated if CASP8 inactivation in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes could have an effect on the outcome of experimental cholestasis.

We used two different types of Casp8 knockout animals with either an Alfp-cre (Casp8Δhepa) or Alb-cre (Casp8Δhep) excision of the loxP-flanked Casp8 sequence as described in the Methods section.4

Undeleted floxed Casp8loxP/loxP (Casp8fl/fl) were used as controls.

Since no differences were observed in 28 day-BDL Casp8Δhep mice compared with controls (Casp8fl/fl) (Fig. S1A-D), for the rest of the study we used mice with deletion of Casp8 in LPCs (Casp8Δhepa).

PARAGRAPH

Casp8fl/fl and Casp8Δhepa mice were either sham-operated or subjected to BDL from 2 to 28 days.

Mice were sacrificed and livers removed.

Our first results indicated that CASP8 did not play a predominant role in early stages of cholestatic liver disease, hence we next focused on chronic time points (Fig. S2A-D).

At 28 days the surface visible macroscopic necrotic foci of Casp8Δhepa compared with Casp8fl/fl livers were significantly reduced 28 days after BDL (Fig. 2A).

Concomitantly, Casp8fl/fl livers showed severe cholestatic hepatitis with widespread bile infarcts along with bile ductular proliferation and hepatocellular damage by histological examination (H&E staining).

In contrast, liver damage in Casp8Δhepa mice was significantly improved (Fig. 2B).

Moreover, 28 days after BDL, biliary infarcts and necrotic areas were significantly reduced in Casp8Δhepa compared to Casp8fl/fl livers (Fig. 2C-D).

PARAGRAPH

Since BDL induces – in a time-dependent fashion – progression of chronic liver disease, we next studied biochemical markers of liver injury.

AST and ALT levels were approximately 10-fold increased in Casp8fl/fl mice and we found only a 6-fold increase in Casp8Δhepa animals compared to untreated animals (Fig. 2E-F).

There were no differences in alkaline phosphatase (AP), total bilirubin (TB) or direct bilirubin levels (Fig. S3A-C).

Altogether, these data indicate that the Casp8Δhepa approach protects LPCs from chronic cholestatic liver injury.

SECTION

LPCs – CASP8 deficiency prevents BDL-induced liver fibrogenesis

PARAGRAPH

BDL resembles chronic cholestatic liver disease in humans, characterized by initiating a ductular reaction accompanied by fibroblast activation leading to portal–portal bridging fibrosis.

Thus, we next evaluated whether Casp8 deletion in LPCs has an impact on cholestasis-induced liver fibrosis after BDL.

BDL induced significantly less collagen fibre formation and deposition in Casp8Δhepa compared to Casp8fl/fl livers as indicated by Sirius red and collagen 1A1 staining.

Protein analysis and computer-guided morphometric validation confirmed these results (Fig. 3A-C, Fig. S4A-B).

PARAGRAPH

Moreover, hepatic stellate cells (HSC) activation – the main extracellular matrix (ECM)-producing liver cells – was markedly attenuated in BDL-operated Casp8Δhepa mice as evidenced by alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA [ACTA2]) expression in conjunction with classical markers of matrix deposition such as Mmp2 and Timp1 (Fig. 3D-E).

SECTION

Ablation of caspase 8 in LPCs decreases the liver influx of immune cells

PARAGRAPH

Liver injury is associated with an inflammatory response, required for tissue regeneration and HSC activation.

We performed immunohistochemistry and FACS analysis for CD45+ (data not shown) cells – a protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor specifically expressed in all differentiated hematopoietic cells except erythrocytes and plasma cells.

CD45+ leukocytes were significantly decreased in the hepatic parenchyma and specifically in the periductular areas of Casp8Δhepa compared to Casp8fl/fl livers, 28 days after BDL (Fig. S5A+D).

PARAGRAPH

Quantification by FACS analysis revealed that the predominant leukocytes were CD11b+F4/80+ inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages, which were strongly diminished in Casp8Δhepa compared to Casp8fl/fl livers, 28 days after BDL, respectively (Fig. S5B-C).

We next thought that CD11b+ F4/80+ might be responsible for the strong activation of HSCs observed after BDL.

Indeed, expression levels of chemoattractant chemokine, MCP-1, that cooperate with profibrotic cytokines (IL-1β, TGFβ) were significantly downregulated in Casp8Δhepa livers (Fig. S5E-F, S6A).

Moreover, we found decreased mRNA transcripts of Tnf, Il6 and Pdgfa in livers of Casp8Δhepa compared to Casp8fl/fl livers, 28 days after BDL (Fig. S6B-D).

SECTION

Reduced cell death and compensatory proliferation in Casp8Δhepa livers after BDL

PARAGRAPH

BDL activates different pathways important in causing hepatocellular injury.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) and Fas ligand (FasL) are involved and both lead to CASP8 activation.3

Interestingly, Casp8Δhepa livers showed significantly less TUNEL- and cleaved CASP3-positive cells, as well as reduced CASP3 activity compared to Casp8fl/fl, 28 days after BDL (Fig. 4A-C, Fig. S7A-B).

Reduced cleaved CASP3 and cytochrome C protein expression in Casp8Δhepa compared to Casp8fl/fl livers confirmed these results (Fig. 4C).

PARAGRAPH

Since cell proliferation, especially of cholangiocytes, acts as a repair mechanism in response to cell death after BDL, we investigated proliferation markers in Casp8Δhepa mice.

PCNA expression was strongly reduced in Casp8Δhepa compared to Casp8fl/fl livers, 28 days after BDL (Fig. S8A).

Specifically, Ki-67 immunostaining indicated reduced overall and hepatocyte-specific compensatory proliferation in Casp8Δhepa livers (Fig. S8B-D).

Concomitantly, CK19 protein transcript levels were downregulated in Casp8Δhepa compared to Casp8fl/fl livers, indicating decreased ductular reaction and cholangiocyte proliferation in LPC-specific Casp8 deleted animals 28 days after BDL (Fig. S9A-B).

SECTION

Caspase 8 in LPCs promotes pJNK, RIPK3 and RIPK1 expression during cholestatic liver injury

PARAGRAPH

CASP8 induction requires c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) activation7 and JNK has an essential role in BDL-induced peribiliary fibrosis.

Hence, we found JNK activation (pJNK) by western blot analysis in Casp8fl/fl livers, 28 days after BDL (Fig. 4D).

In contrast, Casp8Δhepa mice showed dramatically decreased JNK activation (pJNK), suggesting that the crosstalk between CASP8 cleavage and JNK activation plays a crucial role in cholestatic liver injury.

PARAGRAPH

Interaction of receptor protein kinases 1 and 3 (RIPK1 and RIPK3) in the absence of activated CASP8 may induce necrotic cell death.8

Thus, we next studied RIPK3 and RIPK1 protein expression in liver extracts from Casp8fl/fl and Casp8Δhepa livers, 28 days after BDL (Fig. 4E).

Interestingly, both RIPK1 and, to a lesser extent, RIPK3 protein expression was increased in Casp8fl/fl but decreased in mice with Casp8 deletion in LPCs (Fig. 4E).

Altogether, our results demonstrate that Casp8Δhepa livers show decreased JNK, RIPK1 and RIPK3 expression during cholestatic liver injury.

PARAGRAPH

In order to investigate the molecular pathways governed by CASP8 in LPC, we isolated primary hepatocytes from 8-week-old Casp8fl/fl and Casp8Δhepa mice and subjected them to acute liver injury using lithocholic acid (LCA) [10 μmol/l] alone or in combination with TNF [10 ng/ml] (Fig. 4F).

Basal expression of RIPK1, RIPK3 and phosphorylated MLKL (pMLKL) did not differ between Casp8fl/fl and Casp8Δhepa hepatocytes (data not shown).

Addition of LCA or LCA/TNF induced RIPK1/3 and pMLKL expression in wild-type hepatocytes.

However, decreased RIPK1/3 levels and MLKL activity were prominent in hepatocytes lacking Casp8, indicating that absence of CASP8 is associated with reduced RIPK1/3 and MLKL levels in response to the increasing concentration of bile acids during cholestasis.

SECTION

Deletion of RIPK3 improves cholestatic liver injury

PARAGRAPH

Since inhibition of RIPK1 and RIPK3 using necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) had no effect on cholestatic liver injury in wild-type or Casp8Δhepa animals (Fig. S10A-E), we sought to genetically delete RIPK3-dependent cell death by using Ripk3−/− mice.

Ripk3 deletion has been shown to be protective in acute and chronic models of liver injury.9–11

Thus, we tested the impact of Ripk3 deletion on BDL-induced liver injury.

PARAGRAPH

BDLs were performed in Ripk3−/− and Ripk3+/+ mice for 28 days.

Serum AST levels were improved in Ripk3−/− livers, 28 days after BDL compared to Ripk3+/+ and sham-operated mice (Fig. 5A, Fig. S11).

Concomitantly, a clear tendency towards reduced number of bile infarcts associated with significantly decreased cleaved CASP3 protein expression and enzyme activity, TUNEL positive cells and proliferation, and collagen deposition were found in Ripk3−/− compared to Ripk3+/+ livers, 28 days after BDL (Fig. 5B-D, Fig. S12).

SECTION

Pan-caspase inhibition does not protect from cholestatic liver injury after bile duct ligation

PARAGRAPH

Since our results suggested that activation of caspases was a feature of human PBC, we next tested if pan-caspase inhibition using IDN-7314 (Table 2) (Conatus Phamaceuticals, San Diego, CA) might be a therapeutic option.

IDN-7314 is a potent, novel and irreversible pan-caspase inhibitor preventing activated caspases, including CASP1, CASP3, CASP8 and CASP9.

As controls, we included mice treated with the vehicle, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) or with IDN-7314, which showed no observable pathology (not shown).

PARAGRAPH

No significant differences in markers of liver injury such as plasma AST, ALT, AP or direct bilirubin were found in wild-type (Casp8fl/fl) or Casp8Δhepa mice subjected to BDL and treated with IDN-7314, compared with vehicle (CMC)-injected animals.

However, cholestatic Casp8fl/fl and Casp8Δhepa mice treated with IDN-7314 displayed higher total bilirubin (TB) levels and suffered from deterioration of their health status resulting in dramatic weight loss compared to sham-operated mice (Fig. 6A-B).

Hence, we sacrificed these mice 14 days after BDL, when survival was 100%.

PARAGRAPH

Interestingly, IDN-7314 treatment successfully decreased not only the protein levels of total and activated CASP8 but restored RIPK1/3 and pMLKL protein expression to a greater extent in Casp8fl/fl mice (Fig. 6C).

However, IDN-7314 failed to prevent BDL-induced cholestatic liver injury in both Casp8fl/fl and Casp8Δhepa mice.

PARAGRAPH

Microscopic examination revealed exacerbated areas of necrosis after pan-caspase inhibition in both Casp8fl/fl and Casp8Δhepa mice (Fig. 6D).

Using immunohistochemistry, no CASP8 activity was detected, indicating efficient IDN-7314 treatment.

Interestingly, we found that RIPK1/3 expression was localized in immune cells and in the necrotic foci of Casp8fl/fl but not detectable in Casp8Δhepa mice challenged to BDL or BDL + IDN-7314.

In turn, MKLK activation was predominantly found in ductular cells, but also in hepatocytes, of both mouse strains subjected to surgery and/or the inhibitor (Fig. 6D, Fig. S13).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Different modes of cell death trigger liver damage and contribute to progression of acute and chronic liver injury.12

Besides apoptosis, alternative mechanisms of programed cell death have been characterized on a molecular level referred to as necrosis, apoptosis, necroptosis or pyroptosis.13

Therefore, a thorough understanding of the underlying hepatic cell death mechanisms in each individual disease setting is required before defining suitable therapeutic targets.

PARAGRAPH

Experimental models of cholestasis such as BDL mimic clinical obstructive cholangiopathies, including PBC.1

Earlier results demonstrated that apoptosis contributes to BDL-induced hepatobiliary injury.

More specifically elevated concentrations of toxic bile acid trigger Fas receptor-dependent and independent caspase activation which consequently triggers apoptosis during cholestatic liver injury.14,15

PARAGRAPH

Both PBC and BDL cause hepatic apoptosis and dysfunction.

Noticeably, we found that patients with PBC and advanced cholestatic injury exhibited upregulation of inflammatory cytokines such as mitogenic IL-6 and pro-apoptotic TNF, the latter stimulating a pathway potentially leading to caspase activation.

Caspases are a family of important signaling proteases with various functions depending on the subtype and organ involved.

Studies performed in our lab and by others clearly demonstrated that hepatic CASP8 is involved in the pathogenesis of several acute and chronic liver diseases.

For instance, loss of CASP8 in hepatocytes was protective against Fas-induced acute liver failure but triggered necrotic cell death in the concanavalin A (ConA) model, during non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and in NEMO-deficient mice.4,9,16,17

PARAGRAPH

In the present study, we examined whether deletion of CASP8 in hepatocytes may have an impact on the progression of experimental cholestatic liver injury.

We performed BDL in mice with LPC specific Casp8 knockout and investigated the effect on liver injury and disease progression.

We were interested in these experiments as we found elevated protein levels of total CASP8, cleaved CASP8, and activation of the downstream effector CASP3 in livers of patients with advanced PBC.

These results suggested that CASP8 might be involved in the development of liver injury in patients with PBC.

PARAGRAPH

We used two different promoters to achieve hepatocyte Casp8 deletion by expressing Cre recombinase in this study: Alb-cre, which efficiently inactivates Casp8 in hepatocytes and Alfp-cre, which deletes Casp8 in both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes.

These results indicate that cholangiocytes might be responsible for the differential phenotype observed between both types of conditional Casp8 knockout mice

PARAGRAPH

CASP8 deletion in LPCs significantly improved parameters related to chronic cholestatic liver injury such as bile infarcts, necrotic foci and serum aminotransferases.

Deletion of CASP8 in LPCs further prevented the activation of downstream targets such as CASP3 and release of mitochondrial cytochrome c. Ablation of CASP8 in LPCs protected against liver apoptosis in experimental cholestasis.

These results were similar to previous experiments in our lab involving the application of 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine diet, a xenobiotic model of primary sclerosing cholangitis to Casp8Δhepa mice.

In contrast, ubiquitous inhibition of CASP8 in the liver was harmful in this experimental setting.18

PARAGRAPH

The course of both experimental and clinical liver disease, characterized by hepatocyte apoptosis, is accompanied by compensatory proliferation – of both biliary epithelial cells and hepatocytes – and the infiltration of inflammatory cells.

All these parameters might just be associated with reduced liver injury rather than an effect of Casp8 depletion in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes.

Interestingly, we found a decreased number of leukocytes in these livers, and, specifically, reduced CD11bhiF4/80hi monocytes.

This is a finding consistent with the fact that hepatic apoptosis can stimulate profibrotic resident macrophages (e.g. Kupffer cells) that amplify the proinflammatory cascade and initiate the fibrogenic response.19

PARAGRAPH

Deposition of ECM proteins such as collagen 1A1 and periductural fibrosis are features of chronic experimental cholestasis.

Loss of CASP8 in LPCs greatly ameliorated ECM deposition, markers of hepatic stellate cell activation (αSMA) and soluble mediators of parenchymal fibrosis such as TGFβ.

These results are in line with previous conclusions from the work of Hatting et al., 16 indicating that hepatocyte-deficient CASP8 mice fed with a methionine-choline deficient diet are protected against chronic inflammation and liver fibrogenesis

PARAGRAPH

JNK contributes to αSMA expression during liver fibrogenesis.20,21

Interestingly, CASP8-deficient livers displayed decreased activation of JNK after chronic BDL.

Moreover, while CASP8 triggers apoptosis, RIPK3 has emerged as a critical regulator of programmed necrosis/necroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death.22

Importantly, deletion of Casp8 and, as a result, inhibition of apoptosis during BDL in vivo, did not exacerbate other types of cell death such as necrosis or pyroptosis.

Indeed, to deepen our understanding, we challenged Casp8Δhepa-primary isolated hepatocytes with TNF and bile acids (LCA).

TNF and LCA-induced toxicity was prevented in Casp8Δhepa hepatocytes.

In particular, Casp8 inactivation in hepatocytes was associated with decreased expression and activity of RIPK1/3 and MLKL.

Altogether, these data suggested that loss of CASP8 in hepatocytes might be associated with necroptosome formation during acute and chronic experimental cholestasis.

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocyte apoptosis is the predominant mechanism of cell death after BDL.14

Thus the protection observed in Casp8Δhepa mice might be due to the prevention of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis.

Interestingly, CASP8 deficiency in LPCs triggered only a mild activation of RIPK1/RIPK3 expression.

Moreover, we challenged Casp8fl/fl and Casp8Δhepa to BDL for 48 h and used Nec-1, a compound that blocks necrotic cell death.

These results indicate that necrosis might be of minor relevance after acute BDL.

However, more studies assessing activation of the necroptosome need to be performed in order to clarify the role of the RIPK1/3/MLKL complex in cholestasis.

PARAGRAPH

Indeed, RIPK3 inhibition is protective in different models of liver injury.6,9–11

In Ripk3−/− animals, which underwent chronic BDL, markers of liver damage were improved including fibrogenesis and cell death.

Since apoptosis was prevented in Ripk3−/− mice after BDL, this strongly suggests a non-necroptotic role for RIPK3.

These results are in accordance to a recent publication23; however, we did not observe improvement during acute cholestasis (not shown).

Altogether, these results are interesting since they unveil that in the absence of CASP8 or RIPK3, other pathways such as phosphorylation of MLKL-TLR-induced NLRP3 activation, in other words, inflammasome activation24 or the induction of RIPK3-independent apoptosis might occur.25

PARAGRAPH

On the one hand, genetic deletion of Casp8 specifically in LPCs prevented experimental obstructive cholestasis.

In addition, broad spectrum caspase inhibitors are capable of reducing hepatocyte apoptosis in animal models of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis26 such as IDN-6556, that potently blocks Fas-mediated cell death and is efficient in preventing hepatic injury and fibrosis after BDL.17

In the present study, we thus asked whether inhibition of CASP8 in cells other than LPCs could further improve cholestatic liver injury.

We thus used a novel and potent irreversible pan-caspase inhibitor, IDN-7314, that inhibits mainly CASP8 and CASP1.

Inhibition of CASP3 and CASP9 is less efficient.

IDN-7314 showed first promising results in experimental colon tumorigenesis.27

IDN-7314 inhibited CASP8 effectively in vivo but exacerbated RIPK1/3 and MLKL expression.

However, the compound exacerbated BDL-induced liver damage in terms of necrotic foci and ductular proliferation leading to severe hyperbilirubinemia and earlier death of the animals.

In Casp8Δhepa mice, IDN-7314 not only inhibited CASP8 activity, but also RIPK1/3 protein expression and, to a lesser extent, MLKL activity.

Nevertheless, IDN-7314 was neither efficient in preventing cholestasis in Casp8Δhepa, excluding the on-target effect of Casp8 in LPCs in the outcome of drug administration.

These results suggest that LPC specific deletion of CASP8 – in contrast to general CASP8 deletion – is beneficial in the BDL model.

Since IDN-7314 also inhibits other caspases to a lesser extent, a side effect cannot be excluded.

PARAGRAPH

In summary, our data show that loss of CASP8 in LPCs is protective in BDL-induced experimental cholestasis, an effect most likely mediated by CASP8 in cholangiocytes.

Thus, CASP8 and RIPK3 might be required for BDL-induced cell death and injury, a phenomenon also observed in patients with PBC.

In contrast, combined and unspecific inhibition of death pathways might have severe side effects.

Therefore, the understanding of tissue-specific signaling pathways of cell death during acute and chronic liver disease will help to define molecular targets for future therapies.
