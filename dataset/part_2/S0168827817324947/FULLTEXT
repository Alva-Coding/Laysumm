TITLE

Gasdermin D plays a key role as a pyroptosis executor of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in humans and mice

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a multi-step biological disorder in the liver, increasing the risk of cirrhosis and tumorigenesis.1,2

The key aspects of steatohepatitis have been precisely mimicked by extensive basic and translation research.

This has enabled the reductionist assessment of genes and dietary factors involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.3,4

Toxic lipid accumulation in the liver acts as the primary insult which initiates and propagates damage, leading to hepatocyte injury and resultant inflammation.5,6

It is important to note that inflammation in the liver is believed to be the compelling feature that transforms simple steatosis to steatohepatitis, perpetuating hepatocellular injury and subsequent cell death, and promoting liver fibrosis.7–9

However, the molecular basis behind the inflammatory response leading to steatohepatitis is still largely unknown.

PARAGRAPH

Inflammatory caspases, including caspase-1, murine caspase-11, and human caspase-4/5, play important roles as mediators of inflammation.10–12

Accumulating evidence has suggested that excessive activation of inflammatory caspases is implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatitis C viral infection, alcoholic liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).13

Pyroptosis is the dominant response following the activation of inflammatory caspases, leading to pore formation in the plasma membrane, cell swelling, and massive release of the pro-inflammatory cellular contents.12,14,15

Gasdermin D (GSDMD), a generic substrate for inflammatory caspases, has been shown to play a specific role in inflammatory caspase-mediated pyroptosis and also acts as a downstream effector of multiple inflammasomes.16,17

GSDMD exerts its pyroptosis executor function by releasing the cleaved gasdermin-N domain (GSDMD-N) that bears intrinsic pyroptosis-inducing activity and controls interleukin (IL)-1β release.11,18

As demonstrated by the crucial role of pyroptosis in immunity and disease, excessive uncontrolled pyroptosis may be detrimental to the host.11,12

Yet, despite these important functions, the potential effects of GSDMD and the mechanism of its action in steatohepatitis are still unknown.

Moreover, no evidence is currently available on whether GSDMD-driven pyroptosis may represent a new avenue of therapeutic intervention for steatohepatitis.

In this study, we investigated the significance of GSDMD in human and experimentally-induced NAFLD, particularly in steatohepatitis, and elucidated the pivotal role of GSDMD in steatohepatitis pathogenesis, by mediating lipogenesis and the amplification cascade of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ĸB) signaling pathway.

More importantly, we explored the clinical impact of GSDMD-N in patients with NASH, and demonstrated that GSDMD-N is positively correlated with the NAFLD activity score (NAS) and fibrosis, providing new insight into the potential treatment of NASH in humans.

SECTION

Human samples

PARAGRAPH

Human liver tissue samples of NAFLD/NASH were selected from bariatric surgery patients with no history of liver disease of other etiology from the Xijing Hospital, the Fourth Military Medical University.

Histological assessments were determined by two pathologists in a double-blind manner.19,20

Samples from control individuals with normal liver histology were collected under percutaneous liver biopsy, from patients with no evidence of diabetes or hypertension.

Patients with NAFLD were classified into two histological groups according to the NAS.

Patients with NAS of 0 to 2 were considered as not having a diagnosis of NASH (NAFLD group), while patients with scores of ≥5 were diagnosed with NASH (NASH group).

Fibrosis was staged using a four-point scale.21

All individuals had given written informed consent and all the procedures were performed according to the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Fourth Military Medical University, which meets the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.

SECTION

Mice models

PARAGRAPH

All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Fourth Military Medical University, which are in accordance with NIH guidelines.

Mice were housed in a pathogen-free animal facility at 22 ± 2 °C under controlled 12-h light/dark cycles.

Mice were given regular chow or special custom diets when indicated, and had access to autoclaved water ad libitum.

PARAGRAPH

The Gsdmd−/− mouse was a generous gift from Professor Feng Shao (National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing, China).

Eight- to ten-week-old male Gsdmd−/− mice (C57BL/6 strain) and male wild-type (WT) littermate controls were fed randomly either with methionine-choline deficient (MCD) or control diet (Medicine Biomedical, China) for four weeks to trigger steatohepatitis, or for eight weeks to establish fibrosing steatohepatitis.22,23

Age matched obese db/db mice (C57BL/6 strain) were fed with MCD or control diets for 10 days to induce steatohepatitis.22

PARAGRAPH

In a separate set of experiments, Gsdmd−/− mice and WT controls were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) or control diet (Research diets, USA) for four or 11 weeks, to induce steatosis.24,25

Long-term (36 weeks) HFD feeding was also used in WT mice to induce steatohepatitis.25

The HFD provides 60% kcal from fat, 20% kcal from proteins, and 20% kcal from carbohydrates.

PARAGRAPH

In addition, eight-week-old male Alb-Cre mice (C57BL/6 strain) were administered an adeno-associated virus (AAV9)-FLEX-GSDMD-N vector (containing 1–279 residues of the N-terminal cleavage fragments with an N-terminal Flag tag) or AAV9-FLEX-control (containing a Flag tag) through the tail vein at a dose of 1012 vg per 200 μl per mouse, respectively.26

The mice were subjected to MCD or control diets for 10 days to induce steatohepatitis.

PARAGRAPH

For the adoptive transfer study, macrophages were obtained from the peritoneal cavities of MCD-fed WT mice four days after intraperitoneal injection of 3% Brewer thioglycollate medium (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).

Briefly, the mouse peritoneal cavity was lavaged with 1 ml PBS.

The peritoneal fluid was dispensed and cultured with DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS.

After two hours of incubation, non-adherent cells were removed by gentle washing with warm PBS.

MCD-fed Gsdmd−/− mice were intraperitoneally injected with purified macrophages (4.5 × 106 cell/mouse) 48 h before harvest.27

SECTION

Cell culture and treatments

PARAGRAPH

The immortalized mouse hepatocyte cell line AML-12 was purchased from ATCC (CRL 2254), and no evidence of mycoplasma contamination was detected by PCR-based assay test.

AML-12 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium and transfected with a GV362 vector carrying a GSDMD-N expression cassette or control vector.

Experiments were performed on cells rendered quiescent by 24 h of incubation in serum-free medium.

Then the cells were cultured in MCD medium or control medium with or without anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (1:100, Abcam) or with anti-Il-1β (1:100, Abcam) neutralizing antibodies.

Results

SECTION

Characteristics of the patient population

PARAGRAPH

The main clinicopathological parameters of the patients evaluated in this study are described (Table S1).

The histological characteristics of the patients are shown (Table S2).

There were no statistically differences in age or gender between the three histological groups.

Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels did not differ statistically among the groups; whereas, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total cholesterol (CHO), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were higher in the NASH group.

SECTION

GSDMD and its pyroptosis-inducing fragment GSDMD-N are upregulated in liver tissues of NASH patients

PARAGRAPH

To investigate the involvement of GSDMD in NAFLD/NASH, we first evaluated the protein expression of full-length GSDMD (GSDMD-FL) and its pyroptosis-inducing fragment GSDMD-N in liver biopsies from 14 patients with NASH, 15 patients with NAFLD, and 16 control individuals.

Both hepatic GSDMD-FL and GSDMD-N protein levels were upregulated in patients with NAFLD/NASH compared to normal controls, determined by western blotting (Fig. 1A, B and Fig. S1A).

In particular, GSDMD-N protein levels were higher in patients with NASH than those with NAFLD (median [interquartile range (IQR)]; 1.99 [1.27–2.90] vs. 1.11 [0.83–1.23]; p <0.05) (Fig. 1B), suggesting that hepatic GSDMD-N production is prominent in patients with NASH.

SECTION

GSDMD-N is associated with lobular inflammation and represents a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of NASH

PARAGRAPH

We then evaluated the clinical impact of GSDMD-FL and GSDMD-N expression.

GSDMD-N was positively correlated with lobular inflammation (rho: 0.554; p <0.01) and ballooning (rho: 0.390; p <0.05), which are two major histological characteristics of NASH (Table 1).

In addition, GSDMD-N was also correlated with NAS (rho: 0.532; p <0.01) and fibrosis (rho: 0.477; p <0.01) (Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

To further evaluate the potential utility of GSDMD as a biomarker for the diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was calculated.

Both GSDMD-FL and GSDMD-N exhibited high potential cut-off values to distinguish patients with NAFLD or NASH from control individuals (Fig. 1C, D).

In particular, GSDMD-N showed a high overall accuracy for discriminating between patients with NASH and NAFLD (AUROC 0.83; IQR 0.67–0.98; p <0.01) (Fig. 1D).

Taken together, GSDMD-N could act as a biomarker for the diagnosis of NASH in humans.

SECTION

GSDMD increased the severity of MCD-induced steatohepatitis

PARAGRAPH

To address the involvement of GSDMD in the murine model of steatohepatitis, we first evaluated GSDMD-N expression in MCD-fed db/db mice (C57BL/6 strain).

Similar to human liver tissues, GSDMD-N protein expression was elevated in steatohepatitis induced by MCD (Fig. S1B).

To demonstrate the role of GSDMD in the development of steatohepatitis, Gsdmd−/− and WT mice were fed with a control diet or a MCD diet for four weeks to trigger steatohepatitis.

In contrast to the WT mice, the knockout of Gsdmd expression mitigated the serum levels of ALT (p <0.05) and hepatic lipid accumulation (p <0.05) (Fig. 2A).

Consistently, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and Oil-red O staining showed a significant reduction of hepatic steatosis and necroinflammation in Gsdmd−/− mice compared with WT controls (Fig. 2B).

Moreover, the histopathological analysis also revealed reduced lipid accumulation (1.67 ± 0.52 vs. 2.67 ± 0.52; p <0.01) and inflammatory cell infiltration (0.83 ± 0.75 vs. 1.67 ± 0.52; p <0.05) compared with the MCD-fed WT mice (Table S3), suggesting that GSDMD promotes the development of steatohepatitis.

SECTION

GSDMD is required for hepatic nutritional fibrosis

PARAGRAPH

It is well documented that fibrosis is a salient feature of steatohepatitis.28,29

To investigate whether GSDMD is involved in hepatic fibrosis, Gsdmd−/− and WT mice were fed with a control diet or MCD diets for eight weeks to induce nutritional fibrosis.6,22

Hepatic transforming growth factor-beta1 (Tgf-β1) and α-smooth muscle actin (α-Sma) mRNA levels were significantly higher in WT mice, determined by real-time PCR (p <0.05) (Fig. 2C and D).

Consistently, hepatic hydroxyproline content was decreased in Gsdmd−/− mice (p <0.05) (Fig. 2E).

The development of severe intraparenchymal pericellular fibrosis was enhanced in WT mice, compared to Gsdmd−/− mice, as indicated by Sirius Red staining (Fig. 2F).

Immunohistochemistry staining also revealed improved α-Sma expression in MCD-fed Gsdmd−/− mice (Fig. 2F), suggesting that GSDMD is required for the development of hepatic nutritional fibrosis in MCD-induced steatohepatitis.

SECTION

GSDMD-promoted hepatic cytokine secretion, macrophage infiltration, and persistent activation of the Nf-ĸB signaling pathway

PARAGRAPH

Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the development of NASH.

Specifically, GSDMD is involved in inflammatory caspase-mediated innate immune defenses and also controls mature Il-1β release without affecting its maturation.11

To investigate whether the less severe inflammation observed in the steatohepatitis of Gsdmd−/− mice could be a result of changes in cytokine expression known to be modulated by GSDMD, hepatic levels of specific cytokines were evaluated.

Consistent with the improved liver histology, knockout of Gsdmd significantly reduced hepatic production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1 [CCL2]), and IL-1β, compared to WT controls (Fig. 3A).

PARAGRAPH

As the NF-ĸB signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis, and the cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and MCP-1 are associated with the activation of NF-ĸB in steatohepatitis,30–32 the effects of GSDMD on NF-ĸB activation were investigated.

An NF-ĸB p65 nuclear DNA-binding activity assay showed markedly enhanced activity in WT mice compared to Gsdmd−/− mice fed with MCD diet (Fig. 3B).

Consistently, p65 was extensively activated in WT mice compared to Gsdmd−/− mice, as shown by the increased phosphorylation of p65 by western blotting (Fig. 3C).

PARAGRAPH

It is known that IL-1β and MCP-1 are mainly produced by activated macrophages.11,22

We investigated whether GSDMD could regulate macrophage infiltration in steatohepatitis.

Hepatic mRNA levels of the macrophage-specific antigen F4/80 were significantly decreased in Gsdmd−/− mice fed with MCD diet compared with WT controls (Fig. 3D).

In keeping with these results, a large number of macrophages can be observed in MCD-fed WT mice compared with Gsdmd−/− mice, demonstrated by F4/80 immunohistochemistry staining (Fig. 3E).

We also analyzed CD4+T cell and CD8+T cell infiltration, and found that there were no significant differences in CD4+T and CD8+T cell infiltration in WT and Gsdmd−/− mice (Fig. S2).

These data suggested that GSDMD is involved in hepatic inflammatory recruitment in MCD-induced steatohepatitis, mainly by regulating the infiltration of macrophages.

PARAGRAPH

To further address whether NF-ĸB activation was associated with GSDMD-regulated macrophage infiltration, adoptive transfer of macrophages was performed using a murine model.

Adoptive transfer of WT macrophages into Gsdmd−/− mice led to a significant exacerbation of p65 phosphorylation, determined by western blotting (Fig. 3F), suggesting that the effect of GSDMD on the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis is at least partly dependent on hepatic macrophage infiltration.

SECTION

GSDMD-induced steatohepatitis by mediating the expression of lipogenic and lipolytic genes

PARAGRAPH

To seek an explanation for the reduced steatosis that developed in Gsdmd−/− mice, we assessed the expression of genes known to be involved in hepatic fatty acid regulation.

Compared with MCD-fed WT mice, Gsdmd−/− mice fed an MCD diet showed increased mRNA expression of key lipolytic genes, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (Pparα) and its downstream target molecules acyl-CoA oxidase (Aco [Klk15]), long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Lcad [Acadl]), and the cytochrome P450 (Cyp) family of enzymes Cyp4a10 and Cyp4a14.

In addition, MCD-fed Gsdmd−/− mice also showed lower mRNA expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein isoform 1c (Srebp1c [Srebf1]).

However, other lipogenic genes, such as fatty acid synthase (Fas [Fasn]), stearoyl-CoA desaturase isoform-1 (Scd1), liver X-activated receptor α (Lxrα [Nr1h3]), and liver X-activated receptor β (Lxrβ [Nr1h2]) were not significantly different between the MCD-fed WT and Gsdmd−/− mice (Table 2).

These findings indicated that GSDMD influences hepatic lipogenesis mainly by directly or indirectly (e.g. via IL-1β or MCP-1) regulating the expression of lipolytic genes.

SECTION

Pyroptosis-inducing activity of GSDMD-N domain caused extensive steatohepatitis in cultured hepatocytes

PARAGRAPH

GSDMD exerts its pyroptotic function through the GSDMD-N domain.

To further address the functional significance of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in steatohepatitis, we overexpressed the GSDMD-N domain in AML-12 hepatocytes cultured in control or MCD medium (Fig. 4A).

There was an increase in the medium levels of ALT, hepatic TG content, and hepatic lipid peroxide activity as measured by the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assay, after MCD treatment (Fig. 4B–D).

In addition, NF-ĸB activation was intensified in AML-12 hepatocytes overexpressing GSDMD-N and cultured with MCD medium (Fig. 4E).

Importantly, we found a mild increase in medium levels of ALT, hepatic lipid peroxide, and NF-ĸB activation under normal culture conditions after GSDMD-N transfection, suggesting that GSDMD-N is responsible for the hepatocyte injury observed in steatohepatitis.

PARAGRAPH

To further address whether the activation of NF-ĸB was dependent on GSDMD-N-induced cytokine cascades, AML-12 hepatocytes cultured in MCD medium (transfected with GSDMD-N or control vector) were exposed to anti-IL-1β Ab and/or anti-TNF-α blocking Ab (Fig. S3).

There was a significantly decreased expression of phosphorylated p65 in AML-12 cells after the blockade of IL-1β, especially in hepatocytes overexpressing GSDMD-N.

Moreover, reduced phosphorylation of p65 was also observed after anti-TNF-α Ab treatment (Fig. 4F), suggesting that the activation of NF-ĸB by GSDMD was at least partially dependent on GSDMD-N induced cytokine cascades.

SECTION

GSDMD-N-driven pyroptosis increased the severity of MCD-induced steatohepatitis in mice

PARAGRAPH

To further confirm the effects of GSDMD-N in steatohepatitis, an additional MCD-induced steatohepatitis model was used.

Alb-Cre mice were administered vector AAV9-FLEX-GSDMD-N or the control vector AAV9-FLEX-control (Fig. 5A).

H&E staining showed significantly increased hepatic steatosis and necroinflammation in MCD-fed mice administered AAV9-FLEX-GSDMD-N (Fig. 5B).

Furthermore, histological analysis showed significantly increased levels of liver steatosis and inflammation in MCD-fed mice administered AAV9-FLEX-GSDMD-N (Fig. 5C).

Consistently, MCD-fed mice administered AAV9-FLEX-GSDMD-N showed aggravated liver injury, demonstrated by increased serum levels of ALT and hepatic TG content, accompanied with intensified nuclear DNA-binding activity of NF-ĸB p65 and SREBP-1c (Fig. 5D and E).

Importantly, mice administered AAV9- FLEX-GSDMD-N showed mild liver injury, nuclear DNA-binding activity of NF-ĸB p65 and SREBP-1c, and IL-1β production even fed with control diet.

To investigate whether GSDMD-N-driven pyroptosis could amplify other cytokine or chemokine production in NASH, hepatic levels of cytokines and chemokines were evaluated by a cytokine profiling assay (Table S4).

Upregulation of GSDMD-N promoted pro-inflammatory chemokine and cytokine production, including MCP-1, CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10 and TNF.

These data suggested that GSDMD-N-driven pyroptosis is a key regulator of inflammation in steatohepatitis.

SECTION

GSDMD is implicated in the pathogenesis of HFD-induced NAFLD

PARAGRAPH

Since the MCD diet is used as an in vivo model of steatohepatitis, to more precisely evaluate the role of GSDMD in NAFLD, the HFD-induced model was used.

There were no significant differences in liver TG content between Gsdmd−/− mice and WT mice fed with HFD for four weeks, while Gsdmd−/− mice exhibited less hepatic TG content compared to WT controls fed with a HFD for 11 weeks (Fig. 6A and B).

H&E staining revealed that GSDMD−/− mice developed less steatosis when fed with an HFD for 11 weeks (Fig. 6C).

Given the significant role of GSDMD-N in inflammation, we further evaluated GSDMD-N expression after long-term (36 weeks) HFD feeding in WT mice that developed steatohepatitis.

In this additional model, GSDMD-N protein expression was significantly elevated (Fig. S1C).

Taken together, these data suggested that GSDMD was involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD/NASH.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The most important finding from this study is that GSDMD-induced pyroptosis was involved in human and murine steatohepatitis.

Gsdmd−/− mice fed an MCD diet showed significantly reduced steatohepatitis compared with WT control mice fed with the same diet.

Consistently, a noticeable improvement in liver inflammation, as well as a reduction in serum ALT levels and hepatic TG content, was observed in MCD-fed Gsdmd−/− mice.

In addition, liver fibrosis was strongly attenuated in Gsdmd−/− mice after eight weeks of MCD induction.

These data suggest that GSDMD plays an important role in the process of steatohepatitis.

PARAGRAPH

The molecular mechanisms by which GSDMD exerts its broad range of functions in steatohepatitis were subsequently investigated.

Inflammation is a remarkable feature in steatohepatitis.

GSDMD has been reported to execute programmed necrosis in inflammation and to control pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β release.11

IL-1β has long been proven to be an important pro-inflammatory cytokine that drives the pathogenesis of liver inflammation, steatosis, injury, and fibrosis, and often amplifies the effects of other cytokines.8,33–35

Evidence from previous studies has indicated that IL-1β sensitizes primary mouse hepatocytes to TNF-α-induced cytotoxicity and could induce significant production of TNF-α and MCP-1, suggesting that these cytokines are functionally related.36,37

Therefore, we evaluated the effect of GSDMD on the secretion of these cytokines in steatohepatitis and found that Gsdmd−/− mice showed a significant reduction in the hepatic production of IL-1β, TNF-α, and MCP-1 (Fig. 3A).

TNF-α is a key pro-inflammatory factor involved in human NASH and diet-induced murine steatohepatitis, as it activates inflammatory cells and induces insulin resistance.38,39

MCP-1 is a crucial pro-inflammatory factor in steatohepatitis because it induces inflammation and stimulates lipogenesis.7,22

NF-ĸB has been reported to be a critical signaling pathway involved in inflammatory recruitment and liver injury in steatohepatitis.

In addition, NF-ĸB acts as a key upstream regulator of IL-1β, TNF-α, and MCP-1 expression, which in turn can activate NF-ĸB.

Thus, the effect of GSDMD on NF-ĸB signaling was investigated.

We demonstrated that the phosphorylation of p65 was significantly lower in MCD-fed Gsdmd−/− mice as shown by decreased Nf-ĸB p65 nuclear DNA-binding activity and weakened phosphorylation of p65 by western blotting (Fig. 3C).

These data suggested that GSDMD-promoted steatohepatitis is at least in part related to the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and NF-ĸB signaling pathway activation.

PARAGRAPH

It is well recognized that MCP-1 stimulates macrophage recruitment.40

Macrophages are the most important innate immune cells involved in pyroptosis and are crucial to the damage process implicated in steatohepatitis.11,41

Our study revealed that GSDMD deficiency reduced hepatic macrophage infiltration (Fig. 3D, E).

Moreover, the phosphorylation of p65 was partially enhanced by transferring WT macrophages to MCD-fed Gsdmd−/− mice.

Overall, these results indicated that macrophages are an important cell population responsible for the pathogenic effects of GSDMD in steatohepatitis.

PARAGRAPH

The underlying mechanism leading to excessive liver TG accumulation in steatohepatitis can be attributed to an enhanced uptake and synthesis of fatty acids and inhibition of fatty acid oxidation.

Our data showed that knockout of Gsdmd expression significantly reduced hepatic TG content and steatosis (Fig. 2A).

This reduction was associated with reduced activity of the lipogenic gene Srebp1c and upregulated expression of lipolytic genes, including Pparα and its downstream target molecules Aco, Lcad, and the Cyp family of enzymes Cyp4a10 and Cyp4a14 (Table 2).

SREBP-1c is a critical transcription factor for the regulation of target genes involved in lipid synthesis and storage of TGs.42,43

The reduced steatosis observed in Gsdmd−/− mice fed with a MCD diet may be a result of SREBP-1c downregulation, and thus a decrease in TG content.

Moreover, the impairment of fatty acid oxidation systems represents another important mechanism in the accumulation of liver TGs.

ACO and LCAD, which are regulated by PPARα, are the key enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation systems in the liver.44

We found that PPARα, and its downstream targets ACO, LCAD, Cyp4a10, and Cyp4a14 were significantly upregulated in Gsdmd−/− mice fed with an MCD diet compared with WT mice, suggesting that GSDMD could influence hepatic lipogenesis by regulating the expression of lipolytic genes.

PARAGRAPH

The induction of GSDMD in human NASH and in murine steatohepatitis, and the mitigated lipid accumulation and Il-1β secretion of dietary steatohepatitis in Gsdmd−/− mice led us to hypothesize that GSDMD-driven pyroptosis, rather than cytokine secretion itself, is probably the key determinant of dietary steatohepatitis.

Thus, we further addressed the functional significance of pyroptosis in hepatocytes by overexpressing GSDMD-N, which is the functional fragment responsible for pyroptosis.11

AML-12 hepatocytes transfected with GSDMD-N vector in MCD cultured medium showed greater liver injury, demonstrated by elevated medium ALT and hepatic lipoperoxide levels, accompanied by increased NF-ĸB activation, and steatosis (Fig. 4B–E).

The severe steatohepatitis was also observed in MCD-fed Alb-Cre mice administered with AAV9-FLEX-GSDMD-N, indicating that the aggravated steatohepatitis was mainly caused by GSDMD-N-driven pyroptosis (Fig. 5B–E).

More importantly, we identified that overexpression of the GSDMD-N domain could spontaneously induce mild liver injury, even without MCD treatment, indicating that GSDMD-N-dominant pyroptosis is an indispensable mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis.

It is well known that lipopolysaccharide or inflammatory caspases (caspase-1, murine caspase-11, and human caspase-4/5) are required for the cleavage of the GSDMD-N domain.

As elevated levels of lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory caspases are often observed in patients with NASH and in murine steatohepatitis, this provides a prerequisite for the cleavage of the GSDMD-N domain and subsequent pyroptosis.25

In the present study, we also confirmed that the expression of these inflammatory caspases is elevated in human NASH samples (caspase-1/4/5) and in murine steatohepatitis models (caspase-1) (Fig. S1D–F).

Taken together, our data demonstrate that GSDMD-driven pyroptosis plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis (Fig. 6E).

These findings provide new insights for the treatment of steatohepatitis in humans.
