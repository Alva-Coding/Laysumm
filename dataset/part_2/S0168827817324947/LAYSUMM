TITLE

Gasdermin D plays a key role as a pyroptosis executor of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in humans and mice

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has become one of the most feared chronic liver diseases, because it is the most rapidly growing indication for adult liver transplantation and a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma.

However, the mechanisms involved in the transformation of simple steatosis to steatohepatitis remain unclear.

Herein, we show that gasdermin D driven pyroptosis is prominent in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and gasdermin-N domain remains a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of NASH.

Gasdermin D plays a key role in the pathogenesis of NASH by regulating lipogenesis, the inflammatory response, and the NF-Ä¸B signaling pathway, revealing potential treatment targets for NASH in humans.
