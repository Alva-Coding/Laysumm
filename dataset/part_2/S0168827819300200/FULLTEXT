TITLE

Control of replication of hepatitis B and C virus improves patient and graft survival in kidney transplantation

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Kidney transplantation is the best treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) because of a significant survival benefit conferred compared to patients who remain on haemodialysis.1

Although the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients with ESRD has significantly declined over time, it remains at least 4-times higher than in the general population.2,3

Chronic HCV or HBV infection can result in chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma4–6 and increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD).7–10

Before the use of antiviral therapy, HBV and HCV infection were associated with a poor outcome in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs).11–14

This poorer outcome has been reported in untreated patients.11–14

With the development of new treatments against viral hepatitis, an update of data in large cohorts of KTRs with long-term follow-up is warranted.

PARAGRAPH

HBV treatment has improved in the last 2 decades.15–17

The probability of undetectability HBV DNA upon therapy has increased from the use of first generation (lamivudine or adefovir)18–20 treatment to the second generation analogues (tenofovir or entecavir).21,22

Most KTRs infected with HBV have received this safe long-term treatment with analogues before and continue long after kidney transplant.

However, the impact of viral replication on kidney transplant outcomes remains somewhat controversial.23

Additional studies in HBV-infected KTRs are needed with longer follow-up, larger sample populations, and prospective designs to provide accurate evaluation.

PARAGRAPH

During the same period, interferon-based regimens were contraindicated in KTRs with HCV due to the high risk of transplant rejection.

KDIGO recommendations were to treat patients on haemodialysis,24 but interferon-based regimens were associated with a low efficacy25 and poor tolerance in patients with ESRD.25–28

Since 2017, the updated KDIGO and international guidelines recommend extensive use of the new direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) because of their good efficacy and safety.29,30

PARAGRAPH

The aims of the present study were to assess the influence of HBV and HCV on patient and graft survival and to determine the prognostic influence of viral replication in a large prospective French database of KTRs.

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Study conduct

PARAGRAPH

Both scientific Committees from the ANRS (in charge of the research on viral hepatitis) and the ABM (Agence de Biomédecine in charge of graft allocation), 2 French governmental agencies, approved the study.

The CNIL (Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés), the French government agency in charge of the authorisation for the use of database, allowed the CRHU of Lille to analyse these data on December, 28th 2012 (authorization number: 912384).

SECTION

Data collection and variables

PARAGRAPH

Data from January 1993 to December 2010 were extracted from CRISTAL, a national database begun in 1993 and administered by the ABM that prospectively collects data on all organ transplant recipients in France along with their outcomes and donor characteristics.

Recipient and donor data are entered into the CRISTAL registry by transplant and procurement centres, respectively.

Recipient deaths are reported prospectively.

The study was performed in accordance with the French law indicating that research studies based on the national registry CRISTAL are part of transplant assessment activity and do not require institutional review board approval.

Data are entered into the register by each centre.

Data collection is mandatory.

Variables potentially associated with outcomes were analysed.

Demographic and clinical data were collected at the time of transplantation and annually thereafter.

The following variables were analysed: gender of donors and recipients, age of recipients and donor, duration of dialysis, duration of cold ischaemia, underlying nephropathy, year of transplantation, screening of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), and anti-HCV antibodies.

Only adult KTRs (i.e age ≥18 years) were included.

SECTION

Random checking of viral replication in infected HBV and HCV recipients

PARAGRAPH

We randomly selected 191 KTRs with HBV and 511 KTRs with HCV to assess the control of viral replication among the centres with high yearly transplant activities from the CRISTAL database.

These numbers were calculated on the basis of the following assumptions: a) for HBV cases, we expected viral replication to be controlled in 70% of patients, a relative precision of 20% in the estimation of this rate (corresponding to a width of 95% CI) and 25% with unavailable virological data.

b) for HCV cases, we expected viral replication to be controlled in 20% of patients, a relative precision of 40% in the estimation of this rate and 25% with unavailable virological data.

Between 2014 and 2015, research assistants visited the centres of selected recipients to analyse recipients’ medical records and recorded the following information in case report forms: results of quantification of HBV DNA viral and/or HCV RNA, antiviral therapy (“yes” or “no”), the type of regimen in treated patients, data for diagnosis of cirrhosis such as histological data and/or results of Fibrotest® and Fibroscan®.

HBV replication was considered to be controlled if HBV DNA <20,000 units during follow-up, based on the definition proposed by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) Clinical Practice Guidelines published in 2012 to consider antiviral therapy or classify patients as inactive carriers.15

RNA was classified as undetectable in patients with HCV in 2 cases: a) spontaneous HCV clearance defined as anti-HCV antibodies and negative HCV RNA; b) sustained virological response defined as undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after the end of antiviral therapy in treated patients.

SECTION

Case-control study of HCV recipients with available HCV RNA data

PARAGRAPH

For each KTR with HCV and detectable or undetectable HCV RNA (cases), we randomly selected 1 to 4 matched controls from the 29,797 non-infected KTRs, with the following matching criteria: gender, age of recipients ± 5 years, duration of dialysis in quartiles calculated for the overall population (<40, 41 to 82, 83 to 206, ≥207 months), quartiles of duration of cold ischaemia (<15.8, 15.8 to 20.4, 20.5 to 28.4, ≥28.5 hours) and year of transplantation ± 5 years.

The control groups were randomly matched to case groups using the global optimal matching algorithm.

SECTION

Endpoints

PARAGRAPH

The primary endpoint was 10-year overall survival and the secondary endpoint was 10-year graft survival.

Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of kidney transplant to the date of death from any cause.

Patients with repeat renal transplants were also treated as censored cases at the time of the second renal transplant.

Graft survival was defined as the time from the date of kidney transplant to the date of graft loss or death from any cause.

Graft loss was defined as the need for permanent dialysis or repeat transplantation.

PARAGRAPH

For both overall and graft survival, patients with no information at 10 years were treated as censored cases at the date of the last follow-up and events that occurred after the 10-year follow-up period were not included in analysis.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Quantitative variables were expressed as means (standard deviations) or medians (interquartile range) and categorical variables were expressed in numbers and percentages.

10-year overall and graft survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

PARAGRAPH

Main baseline characteristics were compared in the overall cohort (n = 31,433 adult KTRs) according to viral status (non-infected, HBsAg positive or anti-HCV positive) using the Chi-square test, 1-way analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate.

Comparisons in overall and graft survivals were obtained in relation to viral status using the log-rank test.

To identify independent predictors of 10-year overall and graft survivals, we performed univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models by including viral status and other main baseline characteristics (gender, age of recipients and donors, duration of dialysis, duration of cold ischaemia, and year of transplantation).

For each candidate predictor, the proportional hazards assumption was assessed by examining Schoenfeld residuals plots.

The log-linearity assumption for continuous predictors was assessed by examining Martingale residual plots.

Since the log-linearity assumption for the age of recipients and donors was satisfied after including both linear and quadratic terms, the effect of both ages was modelled using a polynomial function.

All candidate predictors associated with survival at a level of significance of p <0.10 were included in the multivariate Cox regression models.

We derived hazard ratios (HRs) from Cox regression models as effect size measures with the 95% CIs.

PARAGRAPH

The percentage of patients treated by antiviral therapy and the percentage of responders to antiviral therapy were compared from random samples of available viral data from KTRs with HBV and HCV, between patients with HBV and viral replication and patients with HCV and detectable RNA using the Chi-square test.

PARAGRAPH

Finally, comparisons of overall and graft survival between KTRs with HCV and their matched non-infected controls were performed separately based on detectable HCV RNA using Cox regression models with the robust sandwich variable estimate to take into account the matched sets.

PARAGRAPH

Statistical testing was performed at the 2-tailed α-level of 0.05.

Data were analysed using SAS software (version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

Between January 1993 and December 2010, 32,249 KTRs were entered into the CRISTAL database, and 816 who were <18 years old were excluded from the study (Fig. 1).

A total of 31,433 adult KTRs (19,580 men and 11,853 women) were included with a median age, duration of dialysis, and cold ischaemia of 49.4 years, 28.1 months, and 18.8 hours, respectively.

Patients were grouped according to virological status (Table 1): 575 KTRs with HBV (HBsAg positive) (1.83%), 1,060 KTRs with HCV (anti-HCV positive) (3.37%), and 29,798 non-infected patients (without anti-HCV antibodies or HBsAg) (94.8%).

The 3 groups differed significantly for sex ratio, age, duration of dialysis and cold ischaemia, year of transplantation, and causes of underlying nephropathy (Table 1).

The prevalence of HBV decreased after 2003 (the median year of transplantation) from 2.26% to 1.4% (p <0.0001), while the prevalence of HCV remained stable (3.38% vs. 3.36%).

SECTION

Ten-year patient survival (primary outcome)

PARAGRAPH

Ten-year patient survival in KTRs with HCV (71.3%; 95% CI 67.5–75.2%) was significantly lower than in the KTRs with HBV (81.2%; 95% CI 77.1–85.2%, p = 0.0004) and non-infected KTRs (82.7%; 95% CI 82.1–83.2%; p <0.0001) (Fig. 2A).

There was no difference in 10-year survival between the HBV and non-infected groups (p = 0.6).

In multivariate analysis, male sex, age of KTR, duration of dialysis, anti-HCV antibodies, age of donor, duration of cold ischaemia, and year of transplantation were independently associated with mortality at 10 years (Table 2).

The proportion of liver-related deaths were significantly higher in HBV (6.85%; p = 0.01) and HCV (7.29%; p <0.0001) KTRs than in non-infected KTRs (2.33%).

SECTION

Ten-year graft survival (secondary outcome)

PARAGRAPH

Ten-year graft survival in KTRs with HCV (50.6%; 95% CI 46.8–54.4%) was significantly lower than in those with HBV (62.3%; 95% CI 57.6–67%; p <0.0001) or in non-infected KTRs (64.7%, 95% CI 64.0–65.4%, p <0.0001) (Fig. 2B).

There was no difference in 10-year survival between HBV and non-infected groups (p = 0.7).

In multivariate analysis, male sex, age of recipient, duration of dialysis, anti-HCV antibodies, age of donor, duration of cold ischaemia, and the year of transplantation were independently associated with graft loss at 10 years (Table 3).

SECTION

Random checking of viral replication in infected HBV and HCV recipients

PARAGRAPH

Virological data were available in 167 out of 191 medical records from KTRs with HBV (87.4%).

Viral replication was controlled in 157 out of 167 KTRs with HBV (94%), including 21 inactive carriers and 136 treated with nucleos(t)ides analogues (NAs).

In the 10 KTRs with active HBV viral replication, 3 were not treated and 7 were insufficiently controlled by antiviral therapy.

PARAGRAPH

Virological data were available in 441 out of 511 medical records from KTRs with HCV (86.3%) (Fig. 1).

HCV RNA was undetectable in 155 out of 441 KTRs with HCV (35%), including 75 with spontaneous HCV clearance and 80 with a sustained virological response after antiviral therapy.

HCV RNA was detectable in 286 out of 441 KTRs with HCV (64.9%), including 140 untreated patients and 146 non-responders to antiviral therapy.

In patients with viral hepatitis who were candidates for antiviral therapy (i.e with viral replication before initiation of antiviral therapy), KTRs with HBV were more frequently treated than KTRs with HCV (85.6% (143/167) vs. 61.7% (226/366); p <0.0001) with greater success (95.8% (137/143) vs. 35.4% (80/226); p <0.0001).

Using the cut-off of 2,000 IU/ml, the percentage of patients with control of viral replication was lower but not so different to the percentage of patients with control of viral replication using the cut-off of 20,000 IU: 83% vs. 94%.

The proportion of liver-related deaths among all deaths was 0% in KTRs with HCV and undetectable RNA and 8.93% in KTRs with HCV and detectable RNA.

A sensitivity analysis was performed in patients with fibrosis assessment.

Assessment of fibrosis was available in 374 out of 702 (53.2%) medical records of infected patients: 93 out of 191 (48.7%) of KTRs with HBV and 281 out of 511 (55%) KTRs with HCV.

Assessment of liver fibrosis was performed in 293 (78.3%) cases with histological analysis, in 12 (3.2%) with Fibrotest and in 69 (18.4%) with liver stiffness.

Diagnosis of cirrhosis was based on histological analysis or according to cut-offs of non-invasive methods indicating the diagnosis of cirrhosis (0.74 for Fibrotest and 14.6 KPa for Fibroscan).

There were no significant differences between patients with fibrosis assessment and those without fibrosis assessment in terms of: male sex (67% vs. 62.6%), virological status (21.5% HBV and 78.5% HCV vs. 24.7% HBV and 75.3% HCV), duration of dialysis (76.8 vs. 87.9 months), duration of cold ischaemia (20 vs. 20.8 hours) age of donors (44 vs. 45.1 years), patient survival (78.9% vs. 73.8%) and graft survival (57.1% vs. 52%).

Infected patients with fibrosis assessment were younger than those without fibrosis assessment (46.9 vs. 49.1 years; p = 0.01).

In infected KTRs with fibrosis evaluation, 29 (7.8%) were classified as cirrhotic and 345 (92.2%) as non-cirrhotic.

Ten-year patient survival in cirrhotic patients (16.4%; 95% CI 0–36.2%) was significantly lower than in non-cirrhotic patients (84.7%; 95% CI 79.6–89.9%; p <0.0001) with an HR of 7.30 (95% CI 2.3–23.3).

Ten-year graft survival in cirrhotic patients (12%; 95% CI 0–27%) was also lower than in non-cirrhotic patients (61%; 95% CI 54.5–67.6%; p <0.0001) with an HR of 3.24 (95% CI 1.5–6.9).

The proportion of liver-related deaths was higher in infected KTRs with cirrhosis than in infected KTRs without cirrhosis (64.7% vs. 1.8%; p <0.0001).

In non-cirrhotic infected patients, 10-year patient survival in KTRs with viral replication (79.9%; 95% CI 72.1–87.6%) was lower than in those without viral replication (89.4%; 95% CI 81.8–96.9%; p = 0.02) with an HR of 2.5 (95% CI 1.3–4.9).

Ten-year graft survival in KTRs with viral replication (54.1%; 95% CI 45.1–63.1%) was also lower than in in those without viral replication (70.4%; 95% CI 60.5–80.2%; p = 0.02) with an HR of 1.69 (95% CI 1.1–2.6).

SECTION

Case-control study

PARAGRAPH

Use of the global optimal algorithm resulted in the random selection of 935 matched non-infected controls for 263 KTRs with HCV and detectable RNA and 482 matched non-infected controls for 137 KTRs with HCV and undetectable RNA.

The global optimal algorithm could not identify matched controls for 23 KTRs with HCV and detectable RNA and 18 KTRs with HCV and undetectable RNA.

The baseline characteristics of the 2 cases-control studies of KTRs with HCV (detectable and undetectable RNA) are provided (Tables S1 and S2).

Ten-year patient survival in KTRs with HCV and detectable RNA (66.1%; 95% CI 61.1–77.1%) was significantly lower than in their matching non-infected controls (81.5%; 95% CI 78.1–84.9%; p = 0.003) with an HR of 1.61 (95% CI 1.18–2.21) (Fig. 3A).

Ten-year graft survival in KTRs with HCV and detectable RNA (45.7%; 95% CI 38.2–53.2%) was significantly lower than in their matching non-infected controls (59.

2%; 95% CI 55.3–63.1%; p = 0.01) with an HR of 1.31 (95% CI 1.06–1.61) (Fig. 3B).

Ten-year patient survival in KTRs with HCV and undetectable RNA (86.5%; 95% CI 77.8–95.3%) was significantly higher than in their matching non-infected controls (77.9%; 95% CI 72.5–83.4%; p = 0.04) with an HR of 0.50 (95% CI 0.25–0.98) (Fig. 4A).

Ten-year graft survival in KTRs with HCV and undetectable RNA (63.8%; 95% CI 52.8–74%) was not significantly different than in their matching non-infected controls (61.5%; 95% CI 55.7–67.3%; p = 0.3) with an HR of 0.84 (95% CI 0.57–1.22) (Fig. 4B).

In KTRs with HCV, we conducted a post hoc secondary analysis adjusted for diabetes as the primary cause of ESRD (Table 1) and for smoking (31.5% of former or current smokers) showing that the deleterious effect of HCV replication remained significant on 10-year patient survival (HR 2.3; 95% CI 1.11–4.8; p = 0.03) and graft survival (HR 1.63; 95% CI 1.04–2.54; p = 0.03).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

This study demonstrates that chronic HBV infection, which had previously a negative impact on patient and grant survival in kidney transplantation, no longer influences 10-year patient or graft survival because of the control of viral replication in 90% of cases, related to the extensive use of NAs.16,17

By contrast, chronic HCV infection still negatively impacts 10-year patient and graft survival, while this negative influence of HCV is removed by sustained viral suppression, as it is no longer observed in KTRs with undetectable HCV RNA.

The present results suggest, in line with the international and KDIGO guidelines, that antiviral therapy should be systematically proposed to HBV- and/or HCV-infected KTRs or kidney transplant candidates to prevent the deleterious hepatic and extrahepatic impact of chronic viral replication.29,30

PARAGRAPH

In this study of 31,433 French patients who received kidney transplants between 1993 and 2010, the prevalence of HBV and HCV chronic infection was 1.8% and 3.37%, respectively.

HBV prevalence decreases from 2.26% before 2003 to 1.4% thereafter; the HCV prevalence remains stable at approximately 3.4%.

The prevalences of HCV and HBV are significantly lower than the 30% and 15% reported in our 2 studies from cohorts transplanted before 1990.12,13

This decrease is related to universal hygienic precautions in haemodialysis units and systematic anti-HBV vaccination in patients with ESRD.

However, the current prevalence of both infection in patients with CKD, including KTRs, is still higher compared to the general population.

PARAGRAPH

In the sensitivity analysis restricted to infected patients with available assessment of fibrosis, infected patients with cirrhosis had the worst outcomes and the value of controlling viral replication was confirmed even in patients with less severe liver injury.

However, the results of this sensitivity analysis should be treated with caution because of the limited sample size of the cohort of patients with available evaluation of fibrosis, the nature of a posteriori analysis, the important variability in the delay to perform the assessment of fibrosis according to the date of transplantation and the risk of inflated false positive (Type I) errors because of multiplicity of comparison.

We did not adjust for multiple comparison given the exploratory nature of this sensitivity analysis restricted to patients with fibrosis assessment.

Therefore, we could not exclude false positive findings.

PARAGRAPH

Before the era of NAs, 10-year patient survival and graft survival were worst in KTRs with HBV.13

In the present study, there was no significant difference in patient and graft survival between HBV and non-infected KTRs, thanks to the extensive use of NAs,18–21 as shown by the random checking of recipient’s medical records.

Thus, these data support the benefit of NAs in KTRs with HBV.

PARAGRAPH

In contrast to HBV, HCV continues to negatively influence KTRs.

These results are similar to those observed more than 20 years ago.12,13

However, to further clarify this observation, we checked many patient files to classify KTRs according to viral replication.

KTRs with undetectable RNA had higher 10-year patient survival and similar 10-year graft survival as non-infected patients.

Conversely, the case-control study clearly shows that KTRs with detectable RNA have lower 10-year patient survival and graft survival than non-infected recipients.

These data strongly support the control of viral replication in KTRs with HCV as the best approach to improve patient and graft survival.

It should be emphasised that the applicability of antiviral treatment was limited during the era of interferon-based regimens.

The use of several DAA regimens in patients with CKD, including KTRs with renal impairment, represents major progress that will allow extensive use of antiviral therapy in kidney transplant candidates and KTRs with HCV.14

HCV therapies with DAAs are being constantly improved.

Three DAA combinations have been approved for dialyzed patients or in patients with ESRD.31–34

Only the new combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir has shown pan-genotypic HCV activity, with a sustained virological response rate of more than 95%34 and negligible renal excretion.

Other DAA regimens may be used in KTRs when the glomerular filtration rate is >30 ml/mn.35,36

DAA treatment should be systematically proposed before and after kidney transplant in KTRs with HCV replication.

PARAGRAPH

Future studies are needed to confirm what has been previously reported in high-risk population for HCV (intravenous drugs user and men who have sex with men), namely whether systematic antiviral treatment can decrease or even eliminate the incidence of viral hepatitis in dialysis patients and KTRs.

A European initiative for HCV elimination (European Hepatology –EASL - and Nephrology association - ERA/EDTA) proposed a programme for “micro-elimination” of HCV in patients with CKD.

PARAGRAPH

The limit of this study was the absence of data concerning the antiviral treatment and its efficacy on the viral replication in all patients collected in the CRISTAL database.

We tried to overcome this limitation by performing a case-control study in which virological data and data on antiviral therapies were collected by research assistants who analyse recipients’ medical records.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, KTRs with HBV and HCV in whom viral replication is controlled have similar patient and graft survival as non-infected patients.

Recent access to DAA regimens in patients with HCV and renal dysfunction provides exciting new opportunities.
