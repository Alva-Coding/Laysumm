ABSTRACT

TITLE

Control of replication of hepatitis B and C virus improves patient and graft survival in kidney transplantation

PARAGRAPH

Before antiviral therapy, kidney transplant recipients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) had poor outcomes.

Since the 90s, nucleos(t)ide analogues have been widely used in HBV-infected patients, while interferon-based therapy was rarely used in HCV-infected patients.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of HBV and HCV on patient and graft survival, according to viral replication status.

PARAGRAPH

Data from January 1993 to December 2010 were extracted from the French national database CRISTAL.

A total of 31,433 kidney transplant recipients were included, of whom 575, 1,060 and 29,798 had chronic hepatitis B, C, or were not infected, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

Ten-year survival was lower in HCV-infected (71.3%) than in HBV-infected (81.2%, p = 0.0004) or non-infected kidney transplant recipients (82.7%, p <0.0001).

Ten-year kidney graft survival was lower in HCV-infected (50.6%) than in HBV-infected (62.3%, p <0.0001) or non-infected kidney transplant recipients (64.7%, p <0.0001).

A random analysis of the medical records of 184 patients with HBV and 504 patients with HCV showed a control of viral replication in 94% and 35% of cases, respectively.

Ten-year patient and graft survival in patients with detectable HCV RNA was lower than in their matching controls.

Conversely, patients with HCV and undetectable HCV RNA had higher 10-year survival than their matched controls without significant differences in graft survival.

PARAGRAPH

Chronic HBV infection does not impact 10-year patient and kidney graft survival thanks to control of viral replication with nucleos(t)ide analogues.

In kidney transplant recipients infected with HCV, patients with detectable RNA had worse outcomes, whereas the outcomes of those with undetectable RNA were at least as good as non-infected patients.

Thus, direct-acting antivirals should be systematically offered to HCV-infected patients.
