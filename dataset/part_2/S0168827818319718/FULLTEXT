TITLE

Long noncoding RNA lncHand2 promotes liver repopulation via c-Met signaling

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

The liver is a central organ for homeostasis with considerable regenerative capacity.1–3

Liver transplantation is the only effective therapy for advanced liver disease.

However, a shortage of donor organs is a real problem across the world.

Hepatocyte cell therapy is thus an attractive alternative to liver transplantation.

Mature hepatocytes harbor a remarkable capacity to proliferate upon liver injury.4

Liver regeneration occurs after the loss of hepatic tissue as a fundamental parameter.

However, the molecular regulatory mechanisms of liver regeneration are still elusive.

PARAGRAPH

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a less well classified group of RNA transcripts with no apparent protein-coding potential.5

Actually, lncRNAs are more tissue- or cell type-specific than protein-coding genes, suggesting they have distinct biological functions in physiological and pathological settings.6

Specific expression patterns of lncRNAs coordinate cell state, development, differentiation, and disease.7

LncRNAs play important roles in various biological processes and regulate gene expression by diverse mechanisms.5,8

It has been reported that lncRNAs are implicated in oncogenesis and metastasis.9

We recently defined several lncRNAs, including lncTCF7, lnc-β-Catm and lncBRM, that are involved in the self-renewal maintenance of liver cancer stem cells.10,11

However, how lncRNAs regulate liver regeneration remains unclear.

PARAGRAPH

Homeobox genes play critical roles in diverse developmental processes such as pattern formation, organogenesis, and the determination of cell fate in different organisms.12

These homeobox genes encode sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that function as both transcriptional activators and repressors, which modulate the expression of target genes in a temporally and spatially regulated manner.

Homeodomain transcription factors can interact with cofactors that help to direct different homeoproteins to their target genes.13

Nkx1-2 (also known as Sax1), a homeodomain-containing transcription factor of the NK-1 class of homeobox genes, was originally shown to be involved in the development of the central nervous system (CNS).14

In the mouse embryo, Nkx1-2 is expressed in the primitive streak, in which the nascent mesendoderm emerges.

Nkx1-2 acts as a transcriptional repressor to induce the action of Wnt/β-catenin signaling to initiate Brachyury expression, regulating the formation of mesendoderm.15

Here we defined a divergent lncRNA termed lncHand2, which promotes liver regeneration through Nkx1-2-induced c-Met (Met) expression.

Results

SECTION

LncHand2 is highly expressed in the pericentral hepatocytes of mouse and human livers

PARAGRAPH

Partial hepatectomy, surgical removal of two-thirds of the mouse liver, is regarded as the paradigm for experimental analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying liver regeneration.2,20

The liver mass lost after 70% PHx can be restored in the remaining liver lobes within a few days.3

In order to identify lncRNAs involved in liver regeneration, we performed PHx and conducted transcriptome analyses of livers from WT vs. day 1.5 post PHx mice (Fig. 1A).

A total of 232 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in the liver of PHx compared to WT liver.

Among the top ten robustly upregulated lncRNAs (Fig. S1A), we focused on an uncharacterized lncRNA, named lncHand2 (gene symbol NR_110474.1), that was a divergent lncRNA against its nearby coding gene Hand2.

In addition, lncHand2 was a conserved transcript in various species (Fig. S1B).

The criteria for selection of lncHand2 in this study were based on i) higher expression during liver regeneration; ii) a conserved transcript in various species; iii) constitutively expressed in the mouse liver.

PARAGRAPH

LncHand2 was located on mouse chromosome 8, as a divergent lncRNA that was transcribed in the opposite direction to its nearby protein-coding gene Hand2 (Fig. S1B).

LncHand2 was constitutively expressed in mouse livers through quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and northern blot analyses (Fig. 1B, S1C and Table S1).

Only one transcript of the lncHand2 gene was transcribed in the mouse liver by analysis with rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends (Fig. S1D).

The liver lncHand2 transcript was 654 nucleotides (nt) long with six exons (Fig. S1E), spanning 16 kilobases (kb), which was different from the existing transcript in the Refseq database.

The mouse liver lncHand2 sequence shared ∼55% homology with human respective noncoding transcript lncHAND2.21

Notably, lncHand2 had no protein-coding potential using PhyloCSF and in vitro translation assays22 (Fig. S1F, G).

In addition, lncHand2 was mainly distributed in the nucleus of hepatocytes (Fig. S1H).

PARAGRAPH

LncHand2 was upregulated after PHx, reaching a peak level at day 1.5 (Fig. 1C).

Additionally, lncHand2 was mainly localized in the nuclei of hepatocytes adjacent to the central vein of liver lobules by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA FISH), followed by immunofluorescence staining of pericentral hepatocyte marker GS and the mature hepatocyte marker Hnf4α23 (Fig. 1D).

PARAGRAPH

We then generated lncHand2 reporter mice by inserting the IRES-RFP sequence into the end of lncHand2 locus (Fig. 1E).

We found that lncHand2-RFP was mainly expressed in the pericentral hepatocytes in WT livers (Fig. 1E).

Consistently, lncHand2-RFP positive cells were spreading from the central vein towards the portal vein post PHx (Fig. 1E), indicating that lncHand2 is involved in the liver regeneration.

Intriguingly, lncHAND2 was also shown to be highly expressed in human livers by northern blot (Fig. S1I).

In parallel, lncHAND2 also resided in the nuclei of pericentral hepatocytes in human livers (Fig. 1F), suggesting that the human ortholog lncHAND2 may play a similar role in liver regeneration as in mice.

Collectively, lncHand2 is mainly localized in the nucleus of pericentral hepatocytes in both mouse and human livers.

SECTION

LncHand2 knockout causes liver damage and impairs liver regeneration

PARAGRAPH

To determine the physiological function of lncHand2 in vivo, we generated lncHand2 knockout (KO) mice via deletion of exon 2 by a CRISPR/Cas9 approach18 (Fig. S2A).

LncHand2 was completely deleted in mouse livers (Fig. S2B-D).

LncHand2−/− pups were born at expected Mendelian ratios (Fig. S2E), and lncHand2−/− embryos developed normally with normal mature hepatocytes and proper bile ducts (Fig. S2I-K).

However, lncHand2−/− mice displayed significant weight loss 40 days after birth (Fig. S2F).

LncHand2 deficiency caused dynamic liver damage through histological staining and serological tests (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2G).

Of note, lncHand2−/− livers exhibited substantial cell death at three months of age (Fig. 2B).

Consistently, the gene expression for both hepatocytes and biliary duct cells was dramatically reduced in lncHand2−/− livers (Fig. 2C and Fig. S2H, I).

Furthermore, liver sections demonstrated dramatic reduction of hepatocytes in the livers of lncHand2−/− mice at four months of age (Fig. S2J), suggesting that lncHand2 KO mice reduce both hepatocyte and biliary cells.

We observed that lncHand2−/− embryos developed normally with normal mature hepatocytes and proper bile ducts via fetal liver staining (Fig. S2K-M), suggesting lncHand2 is not involved in the development of hepatocytes and bile ducts.

Consistently, lncHand2 KO hepatocytes displayed considerably elevated active caspase 3 (Fig. 2D), further indicating increased apoptosis of hepatocytes in lncHand2 KO livers.

In addition, lncHand2 KO hepatocytes also showed suppressed proliferation (Fig. 2E), suggesting inhibitory proliferation of hepatocytes in lncHand2 KO livers.

A genome wide gene expression analysis showed that lncHand2−/− livers increased proapoptotic proteins, but no change of anti-apoptotic proteins (Fig. S2N, O).

Consistently, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (so called Smac) and Bcl2 modifying factor (Bmf) were increased in lncHand2−/− livers, whereas Bcl2 and Bcl-W were comparable to WT livers (Fig. 2F).

PARAGRAPH

To further determine the role of lncHand2 in liver regeneration, we performed 70% PHx in WT and lncHand2−/− mice.

LncHand2−/− mice displayed much poorer liver regeneration capacity (Fig. 2G, H) and smaller liver mass compared with their WT counterparts (Fig. 2J).

We also deleted the exon 1 and exon 2 of lncHand2 gene by CRISPR/Cas9 approach.

Deletion of the exon 1 and exon 2 entirely abrogated lncHand2 expression as knockout of the exon 1 (Fig. S3A-C).

As expected, alternative deletion of the exon 1 and exon 2 led to similar observations to those of exon 1 knockout (Fig. S3D-I).

We next generated lncHand2flox/flox mice through insertion of loxP sequences flanking at the exon 2 of lncHand2 gene (Fig. S4A, B).

We conditionally deleted lncHand2 in hepatocytes of lncHand2flox/flox mice with AAV-Cre vector (Fig. S4C).

We observed that lncHand2-deficient mice showed severe liver injury (Fig. S4D).

In addition, lncHand2−/− mice (lncHand2flox/flox; AAV-Cre) displayed much poorer liver regeneration capacity (Fig. S4E, F) and smaller liver mass compared with their WT counterparts (Fig. S4G).

Altogether, these results indicate that lncHand2 is involved in the regulation of liver regeneration.

SECTION

LncHand2 depletion impairs liver repopulation

PARAGRAPH

Fah−/− mice are defective in tyrosine metabolism causing liver failure and death rapidly, unless the mice are administered the drug NTBC.24

Fah−/− livers can be selectively repopulated by FAH-expressing hepatocytes.25

To explore roles of lncHand2 in liver repopulation of Fah−/− livers, we generated Fah−/− mice using CRISPR/Cas9 technology in C57BL/6 background (Fig. S4H, I).

With intrasplenical seeding of WT or lncHand2−/− hepatocytes into Fah−/− recipient mice (Fig. 3A), we analyzed liver engraftment by FAH staining after two months post-transplantation.

We also rescued lncHand2 expression in lncHand2−/− mice (oelncHand2) via adenoviral vectors.

We noticed that lncHand2 was successfully restored in lncHand2−/− mice (Fig. 3B).

After transplantation, FAH positive (FAH+) nodules occupied between 5% to 80% of the liver parenchyma in nine out of ten mice transplanted with WT hepatocytes (Fig. 3C).

By contrast, FAH+ nodules by transplantation of lncHand2−/− hepatocytes were detectable in four out of ten mice analyzed, occupying 4% to 20% of the liver area (Fig. 3C).

Notably, oelncHand2 hepatocytes could restore formation of FAH+ nodules in Fah−/− recipients as did WT liver cells (Fig. 3C).

Histological analysis showed that the engrafted FAH+ nodules were hepatocytes (Hnf4α positive).

Through engraftment of female livers into male mice, no fusion of transplanted cells with host recipient hepatocytes was detected (Fig. S4J).

Eight Fah−/− mice without hepatocyte transplantation were all dead within two months post NTBC withdrawal (Fig. 3D).

Furthermore, engraftment with WT hepatocytes could replenish Fah−/− livers after NTBC withdrawal and lived almost normally as WT mice (Fig. 3D).

By contrast, engraftment with lncHand2−/− hepatocytes could not effectively repopulate recipient Fah−/− livers and six out of ten Fah−/− mice transplanted with lncHand2−/− primary hepatocytes were dead within 50 days post NTBC withdrawal (Fig. 3D).

However, engraftment with oelncHand2 hepatocytes was able to repopulate recipient Fah−/− livers and eight out of ten Fah−/− mice transplanted with oelncHand2 hepatocytes were alive post NTBC withdrawal, and lived as long as mice transplanted with WT hepatocytes (Fig. 3D).

In addition, we transplanted lncHand2-RFP+ cells from lncHand2-RFP reporter mice to Fah−/− mice, and we observed that FAH+ cells were surely positive with RFP and Hnf4α staining (Fig. S4K).

In addition, we isolated primary mouse hepatocytes and delivered antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against lncHand2 and scramble control into these cells for 24 h.

We observed that lncHand2 ASOs could suppress hepatocyte survival (Fig. S4L, M).

To further validate the function of lncHand2 in vivo, we transduced mice with adenoviral vectors encoding green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) control or Ad-lncHand2 (Fig. S5A).

We observed that lncHand2 overexpression promoted liver regeneration (Fig. S5B-D).

After transplantation with lncHand2 overexpressing hepatocytes, FAH positive (FAH+) nodules occupied 12% to 85% of the liver parenchyma in eight Fah−/− mice (Fig. S5E).

Moreover, the Fah−/− mice engrafted with Ad-lncHand2 hepatocytes were all alive post NTBC withdrawal (Fig. S5F).

Collectively, we conclude that lncHand2 is implicated in the regulation of liver regeneration and repopulation.

SECTION

LncHand2 associates with the Ino80 remodeling complex

PARAGRAPH

LncRNAs function in a wide range of biological processes and regulate gene expression in cis or in trans via various mechanisms.26,27

A recent study reported that divergent lncRNA Evx1as controls the transcription of its nearby gene in cis.28

We noticed that lncHand2 deletion did not affect the expression of its nearby gene Hand2 and other neighboring genes in mouse livers (Fig. S6A-C), indicating that lncHand2 does not function in cis to regulate its neighboring genes.

We then performed RNA pulldown assays with biotin-labeled lncHand2 to identify potential lncHand2 associated proteins.

Ino80 and Ruvbl1, two core subunits of the Ino80 remodeling complex,29 were identified to bind lncHand2 in mouse liver nuclear lysates (Fig. 4A, B and Fig. S6D, E).

The interactions of lncHand2 with Ino80 and Ruvbl1 were confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation in mouse liver lysates (Fig. 4C).

Their interactions were further validated in primary hepatocytes by comprehensive identification of RNA binding proteins by mass spectrometry30 (Fig. 4D).

By contrast, two other highly expressed nuclear RNAs NEAT1 and PVT1 did not bind Ino80 and Ruvbl1 as negative controls (Fig. 4A, B, D).

Moreover, lncHand2 was co-localized with Ino80 in the nuclei of pericentral hepatocytes of mouse and human livers (Fig. 4E and Fig. S6F).

Through domain mapping, we identified the exon 2 of lncHand2 (nt 172–271) was necessary and sufficient to bind Ino80 and Ruvbl1 (Fig. 4F).

Additionally, the exon 2 possessed stable stem-loop structure via RNA folding analysis (Fig. S6G).

Finally, the direct interaction of the exon 2 of lncHand2 with Ino80 was further verified by an RNA electrical mobility shift assay (EMSA) (Fig. 4G).

Taken together, these data indicate that lncHand2 associates with the Ino80 complex.

SECTION

LncHand2 initiates Nkx1-2 expression through recruitment of the Ino80 complex

PARAGRAPH

To pinpoint target genes of lncHand2 in liver regeneration, we conducted transcriptome analysis of WT and lncHand2−/− liver cells after PHx.

Given that lncHand2 specifically associates with Ino80 complex, the major role of remodeling complexes is in the modulation of gene expression.

Of note, transcription factors were downregulated in lncHand2−/− liver cells (Fig. S2M).

We thus focused on the major transcription factors regulated by lncHand2 in the modulation of liver regeneration.

The top ten downregulated transcription factors in lncHand2−/− liver cells were listed (Fig. 5A).

We then generated gene (including Hnf6 [Onecut1], Pax2, Atf5, Nkx1-2, Cbfb, Hoxb6, Peg3, Hoxd12, Hes7, and Scand1) KO mice by using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in vivo18 (Fig. S7A, B), followed by 70% PHx in respective KO mice.

We found that Nkx1-2 knockout most significantly reduced hepatocyte proliferation (Fig. 5B).

Nkx family members are involved in development31 and oncogenesis.32

However, it is unclear whether Nkx members participate in the regulation of liver regeneration.

We next mapped the fragment (nt −2300∼−2100) of Nkx1-2 promoter was occupied by lncHand2 through chromatin isolation by RNA purification assay (Fig. 5C).

Intriguingly, this segment of Nkx1-2 promoter was also associated with Ino80 and Ruvbl1 (Fig. S7C).

In addition, lncHand2 deletion almost abrogated the interaction between the Ino80 complex with Nkx1-2 promoter and inactivated its transcription (Fig. 5D, E).

As expected, lncHand2 overexpression in lncHand2−/− (oelncHand2) liver cells could restore the binding of the Ino80 complex with Nkx1-2 promoter and activated Nkx1-2 expression (Fig. 5D, E).

Consequently, lncHand2 deficiency abolished transcription activation hallmarks H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3K27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) on the Nkx1-2 locus (Fig. S6D), while lncHand2 overexpression was able to rescue the activation state.

Ino80 could form a complex with Nkx1-2 promoter verified by EMSA (Fig. 5F).

PARAGRAPH

In addition, Ino80 and lncHand2 overexpression did not enhance Nkx1-2 expression in Nkx1-2 promoter binding region-deleted liver cells (Fig. 5G and Fig. S7E).

Of note, the exon 15 of Ino80 gene virtually bound to the exon 2 of lncHand2 through domain mapping (Fig. S7F, G).

Finally, lncHand2 deletion abrogated Nkx1-2 expression, while overexpression of lncHand2 in lncHand2−/− liver cells could rescue Nkx1-2 expression (Fig. 5H).

Collectively, lncHand2 initiates Nkx1-2 expression via recruitment of the Ino80 complex onto its promoter.

SECTION

Nkx1-2 initiates c-Met expression

PARAGRAPH

Signals mediated by growth factors and cytokines are critically involved in the initiation of liver regeneration.33

We thus checked expression levels of signal receptors 1.5 days after PHx between WT vs. Nkx1-2−/− hepatocytes.

We observed that c-Met expression was remarkably decreased in Nkx1-2−/−hepatocytes after PHx (Fig. 6A).

Whereas other receptors in Nkx1-2−/− hepatocytes we tested had no significant changes compared with WT hepatocytes (Fig. 6A).

Nkx1-2 restoration in Nkx1-2−/− mice could rescue c-Met expression (Fig. 6B).

Additionally, Nkx1-2 deficiency suppressed c-Met-mediated signaling after PHx, while Nkx1-2 restoration in Nkx1-2−/− mice was able to rescue the activity of c-Met-mediated signaling (Fig. 6C).

To further test Nkx1-2-induced c-Met signaling in hepatocyte regeneration, we incubated freshly isolated primary hepatocytes from WT, Nkx1-2−/− and rescued Nkx1-2 (oeNkx1-2) mice with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulation, followed by 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine incorporation assay.

We found that Nkx1-2 deficiency dramatically inhibited HGF-induced hepatocyte proliferation (Fig. 6D).

However, Nkx1-2 rescue (oeNkx1-2) could restore HGF-induced hepatocyte proliferation (Fig. 6D).

These data suggest that Nkx1-2 directly initiates c-Met expression as an upstream transcription factor.

PARAGRAPH

Through a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we mapped that Nkx1-2 bound to the fragment (nt −1005∼−901) of the Met promoter (Fig. 6E).

Nkx1-2 deletion abrogated the binding of Nkx1-2 to the Met promoter (Fig. 6E).

These observations were further validated by luciferase assay (Fig. 6F).

As expected, Nkx1-2 overexpression in Nkx1-2−/− hepatocytes could activate c-Met expression (Fig. 6F).

Finally, overexpression of Nkx1-2 and lncHand2 in Met promoter binding region-deleted liver cells (Met-p-KO) failed to activate c-Met expression (Fig. 6G and Fig. S7H).

Whereas overexpression of Nkx1-2 and lncHand2 in WT hepatocytes could activate c-Met expression (Fig. 6G).

Taken together, Nkx1-2 promotes c-Met expression to initiate c-Met signaling and consequently hepatocyte proliferation.

SECTION

Nkx1-2 potentiates liver regeneration via c-Met-mediated signaling

PARAGRAPH

To determine the physiological role of Nkx1-2 in the liver regeneration, we generated Nkx1-2−/− mice through CRISPR/Cas9 technology (Fig. S8A, B).

Of note, Nkx1-2-null mice showed body weight loss after birth, reminiscent of lncHand2−/− mice.

Consistently, Nkx1-2 deficient mice displayed severe liver injury through histology staining (Fig. 7A), and serological tests (Fig. S8C), and decreased expression levels of albumin and CK19 (Fig. 7B).

Moreover, Nkx1-2 deficiency dramatically suppressed proliferation of liver cells (Fig. 7C).

In addition, Nkx1-2 deficiency markedly abrogated their repopulation capacity after transplantation into Fah−/− recipients (Fig. 7D, E).

By contrast, Nkx1-2 overexpression in Nkx1-2−/− liver cells could rescue their repopulation ability (Fig. 7D, E).

To further verify the function of Nkx1-2, we transduced Fah−/− mice with adenoviral vectors encoding Nkx1-2.

We found that Nkx1-2 overexpression promoted survival rates of Fah−/− mice (Fig. 7E).

PARAGRAPH

We next sought to verify whether c-Met signaling was involved in Nkx1-2-mediated liver regeneration in vivo.

We then deleted Met in Nkx1-2−/− mice by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in vivo18 (Fig. S8D).

We noticed that Nkx1-2−/−Met−/− mice showed more severe liver injury (Fig. 7F), more reduced expression levels of albumin and CK19 in hepatic tissues (Fig. 7G), as well as much poorer repopulation ability compared to those of Nkx1-2−/− mice (Fig. 7H).

Finally, overexpression of c-Met in lncHand2−/− mice could rescue the lncHand2 KO phenotype (Fig. 7I-K).

Taken together, we conclude that Nkx1-2 promotes liver regeneration via c-Met signaling.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Divergent lncRNAs represent a major lncRNA biotype in mouse and human genomes.

Some divergent lncRNAs exert their functions through regulation of their neighboring protein-coding genes.28

However, many of the other divergent lncRNAs are still uncharacterized.

Here we identify a divergent lncRNA termed lncHand2 that is highly expressed in hepatocytes during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy.

LncHand2 is constitutively expressed in the nuclei of pericentral hepatocytes in mouse and human livers.

LncHand2 knockout impairs generation of both hepatocytes and biliary duct cells, leading to liver injury.

Moreover, lncHand2 deletion drastically impairs repopulation capacity.

Mechanistically, lncHand2 recruits the Ino80 remodeling complex to initiate expression of Nkx1-2 in trans, leading to c-Met expression in hepatocytes.

Finally, Nkx1-2 deficiency impairs liver regeneration and repopulation capacity, reminiscent of the phenotype of lncHand2−/− mice.

Knockout of both Nkx1-2 and c-Met much more severely abrogates liver regeneration and repopulation ability.

Therefore, lncHand2 promotes liver repopulation via initiating Nkx1-2-induced c-Met signaling.

PARAGRAPH

Several studies showed that new hepatocytes are derived from replication of preexisting hepatocytes,34 suggesting that hepatocyte homeostasis is achieved by proliferation of mature hepatocytes.

Pericentral cells of the liver can self-renew over a long term and differentiate into other hepatocytes, which fit the functional definition of a stem cell.35

In this study, we showed that lncHand2+ hepatocytes mainly reside in the pericentral vein of liver lobule that can give rise to both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes.

After PHx, some non-parenchymal cells also express lncHand2.

LncHand2 knockout abolishes the generation of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, leading to liver injury and impairment of repopulation capacity.

Therefore, we postulate that lncHand2 positive cells in the pericentral hepatocytes may harbor the potential of liver stem cells, which drive the regeneration of entire liver.

PARAGRAPH

ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes exert important functions in the regulation of gene expression.36

All these remodeling complexes contain an ATPase domain, a member of the superfamily 2 of translocases, within their core subunits.

These complexes also have domains located in cis to the ATPase that can modulate its ATPase activity and bind accessory subunits and/or histone modifications.37

Based on these auxiliary domains, the chromatin remodeling complexes are classified into four subfamilies: SWI/SNF, ISWI, CHD, and INO80.38

A recent study showed that the Ino80 complex is required for the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells, cell reprogramming and embryonic development.39

However, how the Ino80 complex regulates liver regeneration remains largely unknown.

Here we show that lncHand2 recruits the Ino80 complex onto the Nkx1-2 promoter to initiate its transcription, which induces c-Met expression to trigger c-Met signaling for liver regeneration.

Nkx1-2 deficiency indeed remarkably suppresses c-Met signaling and impairs liver regeneration.

Notably, lncHand2 knockout really inhibits c-Met expression as does Nkx1-2 deficiency.

Our results indicate that lncHand2 promotes liver regeneration via initiating Nkx1-2-induced HGF/c-Met signaling.

Loss-of-function approaches, such as siRNA or ASOs, are commonly used to study the function of lncRNAs.

However, these approaches are limited by potential off-target effects and the inherent incompleteness of knockdown.40

These defects may result in technical variation across experiments.

In addition, lncRNAs have complicated variability in expression patterns and conservation between humans and mice.

It could be crucial to identify highly conserved lncRNAs as potential targets to illustrate their physiological roles in different species by efficient targeted deletion as the gold standard for defining gene functions.

Recently, CRISPR/Cas9 systems began to be used for lncRNA deletion at an embryonic stem cell level.40

Homologous recombination was also used to generate lncRNA knockout mice for assessing in vivo physiological roles of lncRNAs.7

Here we selected lncHand2 that is relatively conserved in different species.

We established lncHand2 knockout mice by utilizing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing.

We also generated lncHand2 reporter mice by knock-in of the IRES-RFP cassette into the end of lncHand2 locus by the same CRISPR/Cas9 approach.

Our results reveal that the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing is a powerful tool for lncRNA studies.

A recent report showed that the mouse lncHand2 homolog upperhand (Uph), 770 nt long, is highly expressed in the mouse heart.40

They showed that Uph is localized in the cytoplasm and controls the expression of its nearby gene Hand2.

We found that lncHand2 is constitutively expressed in mouse and human livers and mainly localized in the nuclei of pericentral hepatocytes.

Deletion of lncHand2 by CRISPR/Cas9 technology causes liver injury and loss of body weight, but no apparent heart abnormality.

Importantly, lncHand2 does not affect expression of Hand2 and other neighboring genes.

By contrast, lncHand2 recruits the Ino80 complex to initiate expression of Nkx1-2 in trans, which induces c-Met expression to induce HGF/c-Met signaling for liver regeneration.

In sum, our findings reveal a novel role of lncHand2 in the repopulation of the liver, which may serve as the basis for the development of liver regenerative strategies via manipulation of lncRNAs.
