TITLE

Patient-reported symptoms during and after direct-acting antiviral therapies for chronic hepatitis C: The PROP UP study

PARAGRAPH

A comprehensive analysis of changes in symptoms and functioning during and after direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has not been conducted for patients treated in real-world clinical settings.

Therefore, we evaluated patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in a diverse cohort of patients with HCV treated with commonly prescribed DAAs.

PARAGRAPH

PROP UP is a US multicenter observational study of 1,601 patients with HCV treated with DAAs in 2016-2017.

PRO data were collected at baseline (T1), early on-treatment (T2), late on-treatment (T3) and 3-months post-treatment (T4).

PRO mean change scores were calculated from baseline and a minimally important change (MIC) threshold was set at 5%.

Regression analyses investigated patient and treatment characteristics independently associated with PRO changes on-treatment and post-treatment.

PARAGRAPH

Of 1,564 patients, 55% were male, 39% non-white, 47% had cirrhosis.

Sofosbuvir/ledipasvir was prescribed to 63%, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir to 21%, grazoprevir/elbasvir to 11%, and paritaprevir/ombitasvir/ritonavir + dasabuvir to 5%.

During DAA therapy, mean PRO scores improved slightly in the overall cohort, but did not reach the 5% MIC threshold.

Between 21–53% of patients experienced >5% improved PROs while 23–36% experienced >5% worse symptoms.

Of 1,410 patients with evaluable sustained virologic response (SVR) data, 95% achieved SVR.

Among those with SVR, all mean PRO scores improved, with the 5% MIC threshold met for fatigue, sleep disturbance, and functioning well-being.

Regression analyses identified subgroups, defined by age 35–55, baseline mental health issues and a higher number of health comorbidities as predictors of PRO improvements.

PARAGRAPH

In real-world clinical practices, we observed heterogeneous patient experiences during and after DAA treatment.

Symptom improvements were more pronounced in younger patients, those with baseline mental health issues and multiple comorbidities.
