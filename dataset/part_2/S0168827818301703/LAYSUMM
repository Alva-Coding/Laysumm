TITLE

Development of a scoring system to predict hepatocellular carcinoma in Asians on antivirals for chronic hepatitis B

PARAGRAPH

This study analyses population-wide data from the healthcare systems in Taiwan and Hong Kong to develop and validate a risk score that predicts hepatocellular carcinoma during oral antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B.

The easily calculable CAMD score requires only simple information (i.e. cirrhosis, age, male sex, and diabetes mellitus) at the baseline of treatment initiation.

With a scoring range from 0 to 19 points, the CAMD score discriminates the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma with a concordance rate of around 75ï¿½80% during the first three years on therapy.

The risk prediction can be extrapolated to five years on treatment with similar accuracy.

Patients with a score <8 and >13_points were exposed to distinctly lower and higher risks, respectively.
