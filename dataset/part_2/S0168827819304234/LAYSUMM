TITLE

Genomic sequencing identifies WNK2 as a driver in hepatocellular carcinoma and a risk factor for early recurrence

PARAGRAPH

We applied next-generation sequencing and conducted an in-depth genomic analysis of hepatocellular carcinomas from a Chinese patient cohort.

The results delineate the genomic events that characterize hepatocellular carcinomas in Chinese patients and identify WNK2 as a driver associated with early tumor recurrence after curative resection.
