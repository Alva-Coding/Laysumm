TITLE

Development of pre and post-operative models to predict early recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after surgical resection

PARAGRAPH

The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is surgical removal of the tumour but there is often recurrence.

In this large international study, we develop a statistical method that allows clinicians to estimate the risk of recurrence in an individual patient.

This facility enhances communication with the patient about the likely success of the treatment and will help in designing clinical trials that aim to find drugs that decrease the risk of recurrence.
