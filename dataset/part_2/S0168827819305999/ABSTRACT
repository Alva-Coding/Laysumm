ABSTRACT

TITLE

The Candida albicans exotoxin candidalysin promotes alcohol-associated liver disease

PARAGRAPH

Alcohol-associated liver disease is a leading indication for liver transplantation and a leading cause of mortality.

Alterations to the gut microbiota contribute to the pathogenesis of alcohol-associated liver disease.

Patients with alcohol-associated liver disease have increased proportions of Candida spp. in the fecal mycobiome, yet little is known about the effect of intestinal Candida on the disease.

Herein, we evaluated the contributions of Candida albicans and its exotoxin candidalysin in alcohol-associated liver disease.

PARAGRAPH

C. albicans and the extent of cell elongation 1 (ECE1) were analyzed in fecal samples from controls, patients with alcohol use disorder and those with alcoholic hepatitis.

Mice colonized with different and genetically manipulated C. albicans strains were subjected to the chronic-plus-binge ethanol diet model.

Primary hepatocytes were isolated and incubated with candidalysin.

PARAGRAPH

The percentages of individuals carrying ECE1 were 0%, 4.76% and 30.77% in non-alcoholic controls, patients with alcohol use disorder and patients with alcoholic hepatitis, respectively.

Candidalysin exacerbates ethanol-induced liver disease and is associated with increased mortality in mice.

Candidalysin enhances ethanol-induced liver disease independently of the Î²-glucan receptor C-type lectin domain family 7 member A (CLEC7A) on bone marrow-derived cells, and candidalysin does not alter gut barrier function.

Candidalysin can damage primary hepatocytes in a dose-dependent manner in vitro and is associated with liver disease severity and mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

PARAGRAPH

Candidalysin is associated with the progression of ethanol-induced liver disease in preclinical models and worse clinical outcomes in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.
