TITLE

Prevalence and short-term mortality of acute-on-chronic liver failure: A national cohort study from the USA

PARAGRAPH

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a condition marked by multiple organ failures in patients with cirrhosis and associated with a high risk of death.

In this study of US patients hospitalised with cirrhosis, 1 in 4 patients developed ACLF.

In total, 25% of patients with ACLF died within 1 month and 40% died within 3 months.

Thus, early recognition of ACLF is important for the initiation of aggressive management, which is required to save these patients’ lives.
