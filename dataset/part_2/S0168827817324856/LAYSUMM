TITLE

Higher risk of renal disease in chronic hepatitis C patients: Antiviral therapy survival benefit in patients on hemodialysis

PARAGRAPH

Hepatitis C is an infectious disease that mainly infects the liver, but has also been shown to have negative effects on other organs.

This nationwide study demonstrates an increased risk of hepatitis C patients developing reduced kidney function and the need for dialysis.

The study also showed improved survival in dialysis patients who received antiviral treatment.
