TITLE

PSMP/MSMP promotes hepatic fibrosis through CCR2 and represents a novel therapeutic target

PARAGRAPH

Our present study identifies the essential role of the protein PSMP for the development and progression of liver fibrosis in humans and mice.

PSMP promotes liver fibrosis through inflammatory macrophage infiltration, polarization and production of proinflammatory cytokines, as well as direct activation of hepatic stellate cells via its receptor CCR2.

A PSMP antibody can significantly reduce liver fibrosis development in vivo.

These findings indicate that PSMP is a potential therapeutic target and its antibody is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of liver fibrosis.
