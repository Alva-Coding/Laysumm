TITLE

Spatial and temporal clonal evolution of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma

PARAGRAPH

We applied multiregional whole-exome sequencing to investigate the evolution of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).

The results revealed that many factors, such as parallel evolution and chromosome instability, may participate and promote the branch diversity of ICC.

Interestingly, in one patient with primary and recurrent metastatic tumors, we found evidence of polyclonal metastatic seeding, indicating that symbiotic communities of multiple clones existed and were maintained during metastasis.

More realistically, some truncal alterations, such as IDH1, JAK1, and KRAS mutations and EGFR amplification, could be promising treatment targets in patients with ICC.
