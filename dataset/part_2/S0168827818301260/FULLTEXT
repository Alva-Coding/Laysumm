TITLE

Inhibition of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 facilitates liver repair after hepatic injury in mice

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatic ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury is a major complication of severe hypotension followed by fluid resuscitation, liver resection, and liver transplantation.1

Hepatic I/R injury followed by hepatic tissue repair significantly affects post-operative liver function and survival, since insufficient liver restoration is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.2,3

Thus, the balance between hepatocyte death and subsequent liver repair and regeneration determines the prognosis of patients with hepatic I/R injury.

Nonetheless, therapeutic options for the prevention of hepatic I/R injury and that stimulate liver repair are limited.

PARAGRAPH

Endogenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a metabolite of arachidonic acid produced via cyclooxygenase (COX), is an important mediator of pain and inflammation.4

The final step of PGE2 generation is catalyzed by specific PGE synthases (PGESs),5 of which there are at least three isoforms: cytosolic PGES (cPGES), and two types of microsomal PGES, mPGES-1 and mPGES-2.

mPGES-1 is the dominant source of PGE2 biosynthesis under basal conditions or during inflammatory states.6

The inducible mPGES-1 contributes to the exacerbation of stroke injury through PGE2 production following brain ischemia.7

PARAGRAPH

In hepatic I/R injury, inhibition of COX-2, an inducible isoform of COX, minimizes the injury.8

By contrast, PGE2 has been implicated in the prevention of hepatic I/R injury.9

The administration of an agonist for EP4, one of the PGE receptor subtypes, is found to confer protection against ischemic injury in the liver.10

To date, the implication of PGE2 in hepatic I/R injury remains controversial.

PARAGRAPH

PGE2 is also known to play an important role in tissue regeneration.11,12

PGE2 promotes growth in hepatocytes.13

An inhibitor of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, a PG-degrading enzyme, stimulates liver regeneration by increasing levels of PGE2.14

However, it remains to be elucidated whether endogenous PGE2 produced by mPGES-1 is responsible for liver repair during hepatic I/R injury.

Therefore, we investigated the roles of endogenous PGE2 in liver injury and subsequent liver repair after hepatic I/R using mPGES-1 deficient (Ptges−/−) mice.15

Materials and methods

SECTION

Animals

PARAGRAPH

Male C57Bl/6 WT mice (eight weeks old) were obtained from Clea Japan (Tokyo, Japan).

Male Ptges−/− mice (eight weeks old) with a C57BL/6 hybrid background were developed previously.15

However, EP4 deficient (Ptger4−/−) mice in the C57BL/6 background do not survive gestation.16

Therefore, the F2 progenies of surviving Ptger4−/− mice and their WT littermates were maintained independently in the mixed genetic background of 129/Ola and C57BL/6.

For the experiments using Ptger4−/− mice, F2-WT mice having this genetic background were used as a control.

All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Experimentation and Ethics Committee of the Kitasato University School of Medicine.

SECTION

Model of hepatic I/R injury and pharmacological inhibitors

PARAGRAPH

Hepatic I/R was induced as described previously.17

Briefly, the blood supply to the median and left hepatic lobes was occluded for 45 min using an atraumatic vascular clamp, and reperfusion was initiated by removing the clamp.

The mPGES-1 inhibitor Compound III or vehicle was intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered.

Compound III (NovaSAID AB, Stockholm, Sweden) was a generous gift from the laboratory of Per-Johan Jakobsson.18

In another experiment, mice were treated with EP1-4 receptor antagonists.

The EP1, EP3, and EP4 antagonists were kindly donated by ONO Pharmaceutical (Osaka, Japan).

The EP2 antagonist was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA).

Results

SECTION

Hepatic mPGES-1 expression is induced during hepatic I/R

PARAGRAPH

Hepatic I/R induced mPGES-1 expression in WT livers from 6 h up to 96 h post-reperfusion (Fig. 1A).

The levels of the two other isoforms mPGES-2 and cPGES did not change significantly in both genotypes (Fig. S1A).

Regarding the up-stream enzyme of PGES, COX-2, but not COX-1 was enhanced, peaking at 6 h and declining thereafter, and there were no differences between the genotypes (Fig. S1A).

Immunofluorescence demonstrated that hepatic I/R caused enhancement of mPGES-1 expression in non-parenchymal cells of WT livers (Fig. S1B).

Dual immunofluorescence revealed that mPGES-1 was expressed largely in CD68-positive cells and partly in Gr-1-positive cells (Fig. S1C).

PCR analysis of hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, neutrophils, hepatic stellate cells, and Kupffer cells (KCs) from WT livers at 24 h post-reperfusion revealed that mPGES-1 mRNA levels were enhanced in fractions of KCs and neutrophils, compared to sham-controls (Fig. S1D).

PGE2 levels in WT livers were significantly elevated at 6, 24, and 48 h post-reperfusion.

PGE2 levels in Ptges−/− livers from 6 to 48 h post-reperfusion were lower than those in WT livers (Fig. 1A).

SECTION

Ptges−/− mice show attenuation of hepatic I/R injury

PARAGRAPH

To investigate the functional role of mPGES-1 in hepatic I/R injury, we compared liver injury in WT and Ptges−/− mice.

Both WT and Ptges−/− mice experienced maximal injury at 6 h post-reperfusion.

Compared with Ptges−/− mice, WT mice showed enhancement of hepatic I/R injury based on ALT levels and necrotic area (Fig. 1B).

mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf), interleukin-1β (Il1b), Il6, and inducible nitric oxidase synthase (iNOS [Nos2]) in Ptges−/− mice was lower than that in WT mice (Fig. 1C).

Dual immunofluorescence indicated that iNOS was expressed in CD68-positive cells (Fig. S2A).

The number of CD68-positive cells expressing iNOS in mPGES-1-deficient livers was reduced compared with WT livers.

PARAGRAPH

Immunofluorescence staining revealed that Gr-1-positive cells were substantially accumulated in WT livers compared with Ptges−/− livers (Fig. S2B).

Quantitative analysis revealed that hepatic neutrophils in WT mice were increased relative to Ptges−/− mice (Fig. S2C).

Flow cytometry analysis revealed that hepatic neutrophils (Ly6Ghigh/CD11bhigh-cells) in WT livers were elevated when compared with those in Ptges−/− livers (Fig. 1D).

Because neutrophils can cause cell damage through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS),19 we determined the ROS levels in isolated neutrophils from the livers 24 h post-reperfusion.

ROS levels in Ptges−/− mice were lower than WT mice (Fig. 1D).

The hepatic levels of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand-1 (Cxcl1) and Cxcl2 in WT mice were greater than those in Ptges−/− mice (Fig. 1E).

Additionally, the expression of CXC receptor 1 (Cxcr1) and Cxcr2 was upregulated in WT livers in comparison with Ptges−/− livers (Fig. 1E).

SECTION

Pharmacological inhibition of mPGES-1 reduces hepatic I/R injury

PARAGRAPH

We tested whether pharmacological inhibition of mPGES-1 exerts similar effects to genetic disruption of mPGES-1.

Pre-treatment of WT mice with an mPGES-1 inhibitor, Compound III, reduced ALT activity (Fig. S3A) and necrotic area (Fig. S3B) relative to vehicle.

Compound III decreased levels of Tnf, Il1b, Il6, and Nos2 (Fig. S3C), hepatic Gr-1-positive cells (Fig. S3D), which was associated with downregulated levels of Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcr1 and Cxcr2 (Fig. S3E).

These findings indicated that pharmacological inhibition of mPGES-1 has the potential to suppress hepatic I/R injury.

SECTION

PGE2-EP4 signaling is critical for hepatic I/R injury

PARAGRAPH

PGE2 acts on target cells through PGE receptor subtypes identified as EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4.20

To identify the EPs responsible for hepatic I/R injury, we determined the hepatic gene expression levels of each EP (Ptger) (Fig. 2A).

mRNA levels of Ptger2 and Ptger4 were upregulated at 6, 24, and 48 h post-reperfusion in WT mice.

Compared with WT mice, Ptges−/− mice exhibited a reduction in Ptger2 at 6 h post-reperfusion, and in Ptger4 from 6 h through 48 h post-reperfusion.

To clarify which EP mediates reperfusion injury, WT mice were treated with specific antagonists for the respective EPs.

ALT levels in mice treated with the antagonists for EP1 (ONO-8713) and EP3 (ONO-AE5-599) were comparable with vehicle (Fig. 2B).

The EP2 antagonist (PF04418948) tended to lower ALT levels, whereas the EP4 antagonist (ONO-AE3-208) significantly decreased ALT levels.

Double immunofluorescence analysis showed that EP4 was mainly co-localized with Gr-1 at 24 h post-reperfusion (Fig. S4A).

PCR analysis revealed that expression of Ptger4 was upregulated in neutrophils and KCs (Fig. S4B).

Ptger4−/− mice displayed similar results to mice treated with EP4 antagonist, as indicated by reduced ALT, necrotic area (Fig. 2C), proinflammatory cytokines, hepatic neutrophil accumulation and chemokines (Fig. S5A–C).

These results suggested that PGE2 produced by mPGES-1 acts on EP4 in neutrophils and KCs to enhance hepatic I/R injury.

SECTION

Liver repair following hepatic I/R

PARAGRAPH

Because the liver repair and regeneration affect the results of hepatic I/R injury, we next studied the role of mPGES-1 in liver repair.

ALT levels and necrotic area in Ptges−/− mice at 48 h and 96 h post-reperfusion were lower than WT mice (Fig. 1B).

To characterize the regenerative response, liver sections were stained for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA).

PCNA expression in WT livers increased from 24 h to 96 h post-reperfusion, and the PCNA index in Ptges−/− livers was increased until 96 h (Fig. 3A).

PARAGRAPH

We determined whether mPGES-1 deficiency increased the expression of hepatotrophic growth factors, including hepatocyte growth factor (Hgf), epidermal growth factor (Egf), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa)/VEGF receptor 1 (Vegfr1 [Flt1]).21,22

The mRNA levels of Hgf, Egf, Vegfa, and Flt1 in Ptges−/− livers were higher than those in WT livers (Fig. 3B).

SECTION

Recruitment of macrophages to repair damaged tissues

PARAGRAPH

Recruitment of hepatic macrophages is essential for liver repair after hepatic I/R.22,23

Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that CD68-positive cells in non-injured regions from both WT and Ptges−/− mice were transiently reduced, but those in Ptges−/− mice at 48 h and 96 h post-reperfusion were restored to approximately basal levels, with greater numbers than in WT mice (Fig. 3C).

By contrast, CD68-positive cells in the injured regions were accumulated in both genotypes, and those in Ptges−/− mice were extensively recruited compared with WT mice at 48 h and 96 h post-reperfusion (Fig. 3C, Fig. S6A).

In injured regions of WT mice, CD68-positive-cells expressed mPGES-1 (Fig. S6B).

SECTION

Profile of recruited macrophages during the repair phase of hepatic I/R

PARAGRAPH

To identify the phenotype of macrophage subsets, we quantified the expression of pro-inflammation-related genes including Tnf, Il1b, Il6, and Nos2 (Fig. 1C) and of anti-inflammation-related genes including mannose receptor C-type 1 (Mrc1), Fizz1 (Retnla), and Il10 (Fig. 3D).

Expression of Tnf, Il1b, Il6, and Nos2 in WT livers was enhanced when compared with mPGES-1-deficient livers.

Expression of mRNA encoding Mrc1, Retnla, and Il10 in mPGES-1-deficient livers was upregulated.

PARAGRAPH

We next determined the subpopulations of liver macrophages isolated from both genotypes (Fig. 4A).

Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the percentage of Ly6Chigh macrophages (Ly6Chigh/CD11bhigh/F4/80low-cells) in WT livers was larger than that in mPGES-1-deficient livers.

By contrast, the percentage of Ly6Clow macrophages (Ly6Clow/CD11bhigh/F4/80high-cells) in WT livers was smaller than that in mPGES-1-deficient livers.

PARAGRAPH

To characterize the subsets of macrophages, we assessed the gene expression in Ly6Chigh macrophages and Ly6Clow macrophages sorted from WT and mPGES-1-deficient livers at 48 h post-reperfusion (Fig. 4B).

Ly6Chigh macrophages sorted from WT livers exhibited increased expression of genes related to pro-inflammation, while Ly6Clow macrophages sorted from Ptges−/− livers displayed increases in genes related to repair-promotion.

PARAGRAPH

To further understand the macrophage profiles, we performed microarray analysis of macrophages at 48 h post-reperfusion (Fig. SS7).

Ly6Chigh macrophages sorted from WT livers highly expressed the genes related to cytokines and chemokines, and macrophage polarization markers, including S100a8 and Trem1.

By contrast, Ly6Clow macrophages sorted from Ptges−/− livers increased the expression of genes related to angiogenesis including Stab2 and Tek, and to cell growth including Ltbp4 and Bmp2.

SECTION

Effect of mPGES-1 on polarization of macrophages

PARAGRAPH

We further explored the importance of mPGES-1 activation for macrophage polarization in vitro.

BM macrophages (BMMs) were stimulated with interferon (IFN)-γ/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to differentiate into a proinflammatory phenotype or IL-4 into a restorative phenotype (Fig. 4C).

Both macrophages from WT mice enhanced genes related to pro-inflammation or restoration (except for Il10), respectively.

On the other hand, macrophages treated with IFN-γ/LPS from Ptges−/− mice exhibited reductions in Il1b and Il6, but not in Tnf and Nos2, and macrophages treated with IL-4 from Ptges−/− mice exhibited increases in Mrc1 and Retnla, though the levels did not differ between the phenotypes.

Of interest, macrophages with IFN-γ/LPS, but not IL-4 from WT mice enhanced mPGES-1.

These results suggest that mPGES-1 is critical for the polarization of macrophages toward the proinflammatory macrophage phenotype.

PARAGRAPH

To investigate whether PGE2 exhibits the capacity to polarize macrophages, we cultured BMMs from mice, followed by incubation with PGE2.

PGE2 resulted in enhancement of genes including Il1b, Il6, and Nos2, but not Tnf in both genotypes, and PGE2 did not change Mrc1, Retnla, or Il10 in both genotypes (Fig. 4D).

These results suggest that PGE2 may induce the polarization of macrophages toward the proinflammatory phenotype.

PARAGRAPH

We also determined the mRNA expression of chemokines and their receptors that affect recruitment of infiltrating macrophages23 (Fig. S8A).

The levels of mRNAs encoding C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (Ccl2) and C-C chemokine receptor 2 (Ccr2) in WT livers were enhanced compared to mPGES-1-deficient livers.

By contrast, the mRNA levels of C-X3-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (Cx3cl1) and CX3C chemokine receptor 1(Cx3cr1) in WT livers were reduced.

mRNA levels of Ccr2 in Ly6Chigh-WT macrophages were higher than those in Ly6Chigh-Ptges−/− macrophages (Fig. S8B).

By contrast, Cx3cr1 expression in Ly6Clow-Ptges−/− macrophages was enhanced compared with that in Ly6Clow-WT macrophages.

CCR2 inhibitor (RS 102895) increased ALT and necrotic area and decreased PCNA compared to vehicle (Fig. S8C).

PARAGRAPH

To explore the contribution of KCs to liver repair, we determined the kinetics of KCs during hepatic I/R.

KCs (Ly6Clow/CD11blow/F4/80high-cells) were markedly decreased and reached at a nadir at 48 h, and increased at 96 h in both genotypes (Fig. S9A).

There were no differences in gene expression in sorted KCs at 48 h post-reperfusion between WT and Ptges−/− mice (Fig. S9B).

Isolated KCs treated with IFN-γ/LPS or IL-4 exhibited no significant differences in genes expression between the two genotypes.

The expression of mPGES-1 in response to IFN-γ/LPS was enhanced in isolated KCs from WT mice (Fig. S9C).

PGE2 did not change the expression of genes related to pro-, and anti-inflammation in isolated KCs (Fig. S9D).

SECTION

BM-derived cells expressing mPGES-1 delay liver repair following hepatic I/R

PARAGRAPH

BM-derived macrophages contribute to liver repair following hepatic I/R injury.22

Transplantation of Ptges−/− BM cells to WT mice reduced ALT and necrotic area, and increased PCNA index at 48 h post-reperfusion, compared with WT recipients with WT BM cells (Fig. 5A).

The percentage of Ly6Chigh macrophages in WT-BM chimeric mice was higher than that in Ptges−/−-BM chimeric mice, while Ly6Clow macrophages in WT-BM chimeric mice were lower than Ptges−/−-BM chimeric mice (Fig. 5B).

Additionally, we clarified the role of mPGES-1 on BM-derived cells for the progression of I/R injury.

ALT and necrotic area at 6 h post-reperfusion in Ptges−/−-BM chimeric mice were comparable with those in WT-BM chimeric mice (Fig. 5C).

To further clarify the involvement of macrophages in liver repair, BMMs from WT and Ptges−/− mice were adoptively transferred into WT mice.

Adoptive transfer of Ptges−/−-BMMs attenuated liver injury and increased PCNA index at 48 h post-reperfusion (Fig. 5D).

PARAGRAPH

To assess the extent to which KCs were replaced by BM transplantation, we transplanted green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing BM cells to irradiated-WT mice.

Flow cytometry analysis revealed that approximately 40% of cells were KCs in the recipient mice, and 15% of KCs were positive for GFP, indicating that 15% of KCs were replaced with donor-derived cells (Fig. S10A,B).

At 48 h post-reperfusion, KCs were reduced by 80%, but the extent of BM-derived KCs was relatively similar to that at 0 h.

At 96 h post-reperfusion, KCs remained low (60% decrease), however, half of these KCs originated from BM.

SECTION

Pharmacological inhibition of mPGES-1 accelerates liver repair

PARAGRAPH

Pre-treatment with Compound III facilitated liver repair, as evidenced by the reduction of ALT, necrotic area (Fig. S3A,B), and higher expression of PCNA (Fig. S11A) at 48 h post-reperfusion in comparison with vehicle treatment.

Compound III increased the number of CD68-positive cells (Fig. S11B), which was associated with attenuated mRNA levels of Tnf, Il1b, Il6, and Nos2 and enhanced levels of Mrc1 and Il10 (Fig. S11C).

Mice pre-treated with Compound III displayed downregulation of Ccl2/Ccr2 and upregulation of Cx3cl1/Cx3cr1 (Fig. S11D).

To further validate the role of mPGES-1 in liver repair, WT mice were treated with Compound III at 6 h or 24 h post-reperfusion, when ALT reached maximal levels.

Post-treatment with Compound III also promoted liver repair (Fig. 6A, Fig. S12A), which was associated with decreased levels of genes related to a proinflammatory macrophage phenotype and increased levels of genes related to a restorative macrophage phenotype (Fig. S12B).

SECTION

Inactivation of PGE2/EP4 signaling stimulates liver repair

PARAGRAPH

In order to determine whether the PGE2/EP4 signaling pathway exerts its action on liver repair, we evaluated the effect of pre-treatment of each EP antagonist on liver repair.

The antagonists for EP1, EP2, and EP3 had minimal effects, while the EP4 antagonist accelerated liver repair (Figs. 2B, 6B).

We further confirmed the role of EP4 in facilitating liver repair using mice lacking EP4.

At 48 h post-reperfusion, Ptger4−/− mice exhibited promotion of liver repair (Figs. 2C, 6C).

The mRNA levels including Tnf, Il1b, Il6, and Nos2 in Ptger4−/− mice were significantly lower than in WT mice (Fig. S5A).

The mRNA levels including Mrc1, Retnla, and Il10 from Ptger4−/− mice were increased (Fig. 6D).

SECTION

EP4 signaling regulates the polarization of macrophages

PARAGRAPH

We investigated whether PGE2/EP4 signaling acts as a driver for macrophage polarization.

Treatment of PGE2 enhanced expression of mRNA encoding Il1b, Il6, and Nos2 in BMMs from WT mice, but not from Ptger4−/− mice (Fig. 7A).

By contrast, PGE2 did not affect the levels of Mrc1, Retnla, and Il10 in both genotypes.

This was confirmed by the results from the administration of EP4 agonist (ONO-AE1-329) (Fig. 7B).

Either macrophage treated with IFN-γ/LPS or IL-4 from WT mice exhibited upregulated expression of genes related to proinflammatory or restorative macrophage phenotype, respectively (Fig. 7C).

By contrast, macrophages treated with IFN-γ/LPS from Ptger4−/− mice downregulated Il1b and Il6, but not Tnf and Nos2.

Macrophages treated with IL-4 from Ptger4−/− mice exhibited increases in Mrc1 and Retnla, though the levels did not differ between the phenotypes.

These results suggest that EP4 signaling regulates the polarization of proinflammatory macrophages.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Hepatic I/R injury and impaired liver repair restrict the success of liver surgery.

For resolution of inflammation and repair after hepatic I/R, hepatic macrophages are key players.22–24

Macrophages are functionally diverse, and the polarization of hepatic macrophages is a crucial determinant for the progression and resolution of liver disease.23,24

In sterile inflammation in the liver, Ly6Chigh monocytes are recruited in a CCR2-mediated manner to become the predominant Ly6Chigh monocyte-derived macrophages and subsequently change their phenotype towards repair-promoting Ly6Clow monocyte-derived macrophages directly around necrotic areas in the liver.25–27

PARAGRAPH

The critical issue is that mPGES-1 could have an influence on liver repair and regeneration after hepatic I/R.

Here, we show that inhibition of mPGES-1 stimulated the process of liver repair and regeneration.

During the repair phase, the impact of mPGES-1 is reflected in the increased proportion of Ly6Chigh macrophages (Ly6Chigh/CD11bhigh/F4/80low-cells), while inactivation of mPGES-1 increased Ly6Clow macrophages (Ly6Clow/CD11bhigh/F4/80high-cells).

The expression of genes including inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was upregulated in Ly6Chigh macrophages from WT mice, whereas Ly6Clow macrophages from Ptges−/− mice enhanced the expression of growth factors equipping them to facilitate hepatocyte proliferation and angiogenesis.

The phenotypic conversion of Ly6Chigh macrophages into Ly6Clow macrophages was associated with alteration of the transcriptional profiles, which is consistent with results by others.25,28

The view of in situ phenotypic switch of macrophages is indicated by our adoptive transfer model.

Adoptive transfer of pre-polarized BMMs from Ptges−/− mice into WT mice facilitates liver repair, suggesting that Ly6Clow macrophages are not recruited, but develop as a more differentiated type from Ly6Chigh monocyte-derived macrophages in situ.

We previously reported that BM-derived macrophages play a critical role in liver resolution and repair after hepatic I/R.22

Consistent with this, our present data revealed that mPGES-1 deficiency in BM-derived macrophages contributes to liver repair associated with recruitment of Ly6Chigh macrophages.

In vitro studies support the importance of mPGES-1 for the polarization of macrophages.

mPGES-1 expression was upregulated by proinflammatory macrophages.

In agreement with this observation, Ly6Chigh monocytes recruited into the livers treated with acetaminophen enhance the gene expression of Ptges.25

Ptges−/− mice also exhibited faster injury resolution and facilitated liver repair, likely attributed to enhanced expression of regenerative markers, such as HGF, EGF, and VEGF-A/VEGFR1, which contribute to liver repair.21,22

Taken together, regulation of macrophage polarization by mPGES-1 would promote liver repair from hepatic I/R injury.

PARAGRAPH

PGE2 acts on target cells through EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4.20

We identified the PGE2/EP4 signaling pathway exerts its action on liver repair and the differentiation of proinflammatory macrophages to restorative macrophages phenotype.

Because our studies suggest that Ly6Chigh monocyte-derived macrophages are both the source and target of PGE2, PGE2 stimulates macrophages in an autocrine manner and polarizes the macrophages toward the proinflammatory phenotype in the inflamed liver.

The present study also demonstrated that PGE2 upregulates the expression of IL-1β, but not TNFα in macrophages, which is consistent with the recent results.29

The different effect of PGE2 on expression of inflammatory cytokines in BM-derived macrophages suggests phenotypes of macrophages are complex.

Although inactivation of mPGES-1/PGE2/EP4 pathway in the hepatic microenvironment would shift the balance from proinflammatory to restorative macrophages, further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms of switch in macrophage polarization.

PARAGRAPH

As a consequence of liver tissue injury, secreted CCL2 from activated KCs recruit Ly6Chigh monocytes expressing CCR2+ toward the hepatic necrotic area.23,26,28

Infiltrated CCR2+Ly6Chigh monocytes develop into Ly6Chigh monocyte-derived macrophages in the injured regions.24

Our data demonstrated that mPGES-1 was involved in accumulation of Ly6Chigh macrophages expressing CCR2 into the liver.

The infiltration of Ly6Chigh monocytes promoted by CCR2 contributes to the aggravation of hepatic inflammation.28

CCR2 inactivation attenuates acetaminophen hepatotoxicity without affecting repair processes,28 while others reported that CCR2 inhibition decreases reparative macrophages with delay in repair,25 which is in agreement with our results.

Further studies will be needed to clarify the functional role of CCR2 in Ly6Chigh monocyte-derived macrophages in the repair following hepatic I/R.

PARAGRAPH

KCs are crucial for the maintenance of liver integrity and its restoration after injury.

At an early phase of hepatic I/R, KCs are activated to produce proinflammatory mediators; however, KCs were reduced at 48 h post-reperfusion and the phenotypes of KCs did not differ between the genotypes.

mPGES-1 and PGE2 failed to affect polarization of KCs.

This suggested that mPGES-1 in KCs did not play a major role in liver repair; although we cannot exclude the possibility that KCs are important effectors of resolution/tissue-repair processes following acute liver injury.

Despite reduced liver injury in Ptges−/− mice, massive expansion of CD68-positive macrophages into the livers was required to repair the damaged tissues.

The raised CD68-positive macrophages in Ptges−/− mice could be composed of heterogeneous populations of macrophages including recruitment of monocyte-derived cells, or enhanced survival or increased proliferation of KCs.

Therefore, KCs, which are restored in the late repair phase24,25 would participate in liver repair.

PARAGRAPH

Mice pre-treated with the mPGES1 inhibitor Compound III showed promotion of liver repair as observed in Ptges−/− mice.

However, because the liver injury was reduced in Ptges−/− mice, it is possible that activation of the liver regeneration process in the Compound III-pre-treated mice is a consequence of the reduced liver injury and does not reflect a direct effect of the intervention on the liver regeneration process.

To better support the argument that mPGES-1 inhibitors directly drive liver repair, an intervention that is still beneficial at or after the peak of the injury is needed.

Here, we demonstrated that the mPGES-1 inhibitor given as late as 6 h or 24 h post-reperfusion, at a time when hepatic I/R injury has peaked and cell injury is in development, was still able to reduce liver injury and increase the PCNA index at 48 h post-reperfusion.

These results support the potential effectiveness of Compound III for patients with hepatic I/R injury.

However, inhibition of mPGES-1 may be undesirable in the setting of cardiac remodeling after acute myocardial infarction.30

Therefore, the consequences of mPGES-1 blockade by global deletion of mPGES-1 or systemic drug administration might differ among cell types as well as activation of EPs in different tissues.

Although the present results indicate that mPGES-1 would be a target for liver injury and repair following hepatic I/R, further studies using knockout mice selectively lacking mPGES-1 in macrophages are required to clarify its role in hepatic I/R injury.

PARAGRAPH

The current study has several limitations.

Different degrees of initial injury between the two genotypes would alter the numbers and subsets of macrophages, which are involved in the process of liver repair.

Additionally, different genetic backgrounds of mice are used in the present study.

Therefore, the results should be carefully interpreted.

PARAGRAPH

The present study also demonstrated that Ptges−/− mice developed a diminished degree of hepatic I/R injury with reduced proinflammatory mediators and neutrophil-mediated cytotoxicity through inactivation of EP4 signaling.

During the early phase of hepatic I/R, mPGES-1 was upregulated in KCs and neutrophils, and KCs produce proinflammatory cytokines, which in turn activate hepatic neutrophils to amplify hepatocellular damage.19

Inhibition of mPGES-1 attenuates reperfusion injury through inactivation of KCs and neutrophils, indicating a crucial role of mPGES-1 in hepatic I/R injury, which is consistent with recent studies.31,32

The function of mPGES-1-derived PGE2 is mediated by four G protein-coupled PGE2 receptor subtypes, EP1-EP4.20

Out of the four EP receptors, hepatic I/R injury is dependent on EP4 signaling.

EP4-mediated proinflammatory responses also have been demonstrated in models of arthritis, encephalomyelitis, and contact hypersensitivity.33,34

By contrast, EP4 activation exerts an anti-inflammatory property in I/R injury in liver10 and heart35 as evidenced by inhibiting infiltration of innate immune cells and the release of proinflammatory cytokines.10,35

Therefore, it remains to be clarified why mPGES-1-derived PGE2 exerts proinflammatory effects through EP4 signaling in certain local microenvironments and anti-inflammatory actions in others.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, these findings suggest that PGE2 derived from inducible mPGES-1 exerts an endogenous, proinflammatory, and suppressive tissue-regenerative action in hepatic I/R injury through EP4 signaling.

Regulation of mPGES-1 would rescue hepatic I/R injury and stimulate the innate immunity to facilitate liver regeneration.

Inhibition of mPGES-1 provides potential for the resolution of inflammatory processes and the restoration of injured livers and may be a good target for the treatment of acute liver injury elicited by hepatic I/R.
