TITLE

Global trends in mortality from intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Cholangiocarcinoma is the second most common primary liver neoplasm after hepatocellular carcinoma.1,2

These neoplasms arise from the epithelial cells of the biliary tree, commonly classified as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) if they arise above the hilar junction of bile ducts or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) if they arise within or below the hilum.

PARAGRAPH

These 2 types of cancer have some recognized differences in risk factors and clinical presentation.3–6

However, ICC and ECC have rarely been studied comparatively, possibly due to difficulties in their diagnosis, registration and certification.7–9

However, the validity of death certification for these neoplasms has improved in recent years.8,9

PARAGRAPH

Still, mortality trends from ICC and ECC have been inconsistent over the last decades10–12.

Therefore, in this work, we aim to analyze recent mortality trends from ICC and ECC in countries with valid data.

SECTION

Materials and methods

PARAGRAPH

We extracted official death certification data for ICC and ECC from the World Health Organization (WHO) database, as available on electronic support,13 between 1995 and 2016, when the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) was used (ICD-10 code C22.1 for ICC, and C24.0 for ECC).14

Gallbladder cancer (ICD-10 code C23) was not included.

Histological codes were not available.

PARAGRAPH

We analyzed data for 18 European countries, 16 of which belonged to the European Union, 9 countries from the Americas, and 5 countries from Australasia.

We selected these countries because they reported consistent and valid data, according to the WHO guidelines,15,16 i.e. all countries considered had over 2 million inhabitants and death certification coverage was above 85%.

PARAGRAPH

We extracted estimates of the resident population, based on official censuses, from the same WHO database.13

For American countries, since data were unavailable in the WHO database for several years, we extracted the populations from the Pan American Health Organization database.17

PARAGRAPH

From the matrices of certified deaths and resident populations, we computed age-specific rates for each 5-year age group (from 0–4 to 85+ years, and from 0–4 to 80+ years for American countries), sex, and calendar year.

We then computed age-standardized mortality rates per 100,000 person-years at all ages and for those aged 45–64 years, using the direct method of standardization based on the 1960 world standard population.18

PARAGRAPH

For 24 countries with a population greater than 10 million or annual average number of deaths greater than 200 in the last quinquennium, we performed a joinpoint regression analysis for ICC mortality during the period (1995–2016).

We thus identified the years when a significant change in the linear slope of the temporal trend (on a log scale) occurred, by testing from 0 up to a maximum of 3 inflection points (called “joinpoints”).19,20

The estimated annual percentage change (APC) was then computed for each of the identified trends by fitting a regression line to the natural logarithm of the rates using calendar year as a regressor variable.

Results

PARAGRAPH

Table 1 shows age-standardized mortality rates from ICC and ECC per 100,000 person-years, at all ages, for 2002 (2000–2004), 2007 (2005–2009), and 2012 (2010–2014), according to sex and country.

In addition, Table 1 shows the annual average number of deaths of the more recent period, and the corresponding percentage change in rates between 2012 and 2002, according to sex and country.

PARAGRAPH

Mortality rates from ICC were consistently below 1/100,000 among men in the early 2000s in most countries.

Between 2002 and 2012, mortality increased in all countries except in Finland.

The highest incremental changes were observed in Norway, Croatia, Denmark, the UK, Germany, and Portugal among European countries, in Argentina, Chile, and Brazil among American countries, and in Australia.

As a result, in the 2010–2014 period, mortality rates from ICC in men were between 1–2/100,000 person-years in most countries (Fig. 1).

The highest mortality rates were in Hong Kong (2.5/100,000 in men), and in France, Austria, Spain, the UK, and Australia (between 1.5 and 1.8/100,000 in men).

The lowest rates (0.2 and 0.5/100,000) were registered in the Latin American countries considered.

ICC rates were 1.04/100,000 for men in the USA, and 1.1/100,000 in Japan.

The differences in rates across countries were highly significant.

PARAGRAPH

The mortality patterns were similar in women, although they had generally lower mortality rates than men.

Mortality rates from ICC increased in all countries, except in Finland (−15%) and Japan (−1.7%).

The highest percentage changes were observed in Croatia, Norway, Lithuania, Denmark, the UK, Argentina, and Chile.

The highest mortality rates over 1/100,000 women were registered in Hong Kong (1.7), the UK (1.5), Australia, Canada, and Austria (around 1.2), Belgium, France, Switzerland, and Norway (around 1).

The lowest rates (below 0.5/100,000 women) were observed in Argentina (0.2), Hungary (0.3), Brazil, Venezuela, and the Czech Republic (around 0.4), Chile and Puerto Rico (almost 0.5).

ICC rates in the USA were 0.8/100,000 women, and 0.6/100,000 in Japan (Fig. 1).

PARAGRAPH

With reference to ECC, rates of 0.5–0.9/100,000 in the early 2000s were observed in Lithuania (about 0.5/100,000 men), Croatia, Germany, Sweden (around 0.6), Austria and Hungary (almost 0.9).

Japan had a mortality rate of 3.2/100,000 men around 2002.

Over the last decade, ECC rates decreased in most countries.

In 2010–2014, mortality from ECC showed rates below 1/100,000 men in all countries, with the only exception being Japan (2.8/100,000 men, Fig. 2).

The lowest rates below 0.1/100,000 men were observed in some central and northern European countries, in Canada and most Latin American countries, Israel, and in Australia.

PARAGRAPH

Mortality rates from ECC decreased in women, too, in most countries.

The highest rates in 2010–2014 were registered in Japan (1.4/100,000), followed by Austria, Germany, and other central European countries (Fig. 2).

PARAGRAPH

Table 2 shows the age-standardized mortality rates at 45–64 years of age.

For ICC, male mortality rates showed substantial increases over the last decade with rates that varied between 2 and 3/100,000 men.

In 2010–2014, the highest mortality rates were observed in Hong Kong (3.7/100,000), and in Austria, France and Spain (around 3/100,000).

The lowest rates were registered in Latin American countries.

For ECC, mortality rates were below 1/100,000 in all countries, with the exception of Japan (3.1/100,000 men), Hungary (1.4) and Germany (1.0).

Also, in middle-aged women, upward trends were observed for ICC.

In 2010–2014, ICC rates varied around 1–2/100,000 person-years.

In contrast, mortality from ECC in women aged 45 to 64 years old declined in most countries, with rates below 0.4/100,000, and only a few countries showing rates between 0.5–1.0/100,000.

PARAGRAPH

Fig. 3 and Table 3 report the joinpoint regression analysis results on mortality trends from ICC.

Upward trends were observed in most countries.

The APC in Europe varied between 2% in the Czech Republic and 7.6% in Portugal for the whole period.

There were substantial early increases in Germany and Italy, followed by a levelling off thereafter.

In the Americas the highest increases were in Chile and Argentina.

Rising mortality trends until 2013 in the USA slowed down in recent years.

Hong Kong showed stable rates followed by a marked decrease in the most recent years, whereas in Japan they were upward until the early 2000s and stable thereafter.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

This work showed global increases in mortality from ICC, and declines from ECC for both sexes, in most countries providing acceptable data reliability.

It also shows substantial variations, with the highest rates in East Asia and northern and central Europe.

PARAGRAPH

The reliability and validity of death certification for correctly ascertaining ICC and ECC is possibly affected by diagnostic misclassification between hepatocellular cancers, other liver neoplasms, gallbladder cancers, and between ICC and ECC.8

Thus, in our analysis we selected countries with acceptably valid data, according to death certification coverage and population size.

Still, a misclassification between ICC and hepatocellular carcinoma is possible, particularly in cirrhotic patients in whom a biopsy was not performed.

While we recognize that using the more granular anatomic classification of intrahepatic, perihilar or distal may have additional clinical implications,21 we were limited to the classification system used by most countries.

PARAGRAPH

Mortality trends from ICC and ECC may have been influenced by changes in classification of these neoplasms.

Before the 2000s, cases of hilar cholangiocarcinoma, called “Klatskin” cancer, were often classified as ICC instead of ECC.

However, “Klatskin” tumours are relatively uncommon (e.g. 7% of cholangiocarcinoma in the US) and mortality from ICC progressively increased over recent calendar periods, even after correctly classifying hilar cholangiocarcinoma as ECC.8,9,22

PARAGRAPH

More generally, improvements in diagnostic techniques could partly explain the increases in ICC, i.e. better classification of different forms of intrahepatic neoplasms.9

With reference to incidence, an analysis of data from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, covering the period from 1999 to 2013, reported an increase in ICC across sexes and racial/ethnic groups, and a smaller increase in ECC.23

Despite recent advances in the surgical management of this neoplasm, the prognosis remains poor.3,24,25

PARAGRAPH

The divergent mortality trends observed for ICC and ECC suggest that they have at least partially different etiologies.23

Only a few studies have investigated the epidemiology of ICC and ECC separately.

Available data indicate that these neoplasms may share several risk factors, albeit with differences at least in quantitative terms.4–6

A US record-linkage study based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare dataset5 found a positive association with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) mostly for ICC.

An association between HCV infection and increased risk of ICC but not ECC was also reported in a large cohort study from the USA.26

Likewise, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) were more strongly associated with ICC, whereas most bile duct conditions tended to be more strongly related with ECC.4,5

PARAGRAPH

Knowledge of risk factors helps to explain ICC trends, which showed a levelling off over recent years in France and Italy, i.e. countries that experienced a decrease in alcohol-related chronic liver disease and cirrhosis in the recent past.

In contrast, ICC rates increased in other countries, including most European and American countries, which over recent calendar periods showed increases in the prevalence of HCV infection, heavy alcohol consumption, obesity, and NAFLD.27,28

Liver flukes (i.e., Opisthorchis viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis) are a known cause of ICC and ECC in South East Asia.29

They may have somewhat influenced rates in Hong Kong, but are unlikely to be important causes of these diseases in the other countries examined in this study.

PARAGRAPH

Cirrhosis is a strong determinant and pathogenic link to liver cancer.30

However, on the basis of death certification, no information was available on cirrhosis.

PARAGRAPH

A plausible explanation for the generalized decrease in ECC mortality is the increasing use of cholecystectomy, facilitated by laparoscopic techniques over the last decades,31 given the known strong association between gallstones and the risk of ECC including gallbladder cancer.

Given the low ECC rates, they may be more susceptible to misclassification of Klatskin and gallbladder tumours than ICC.

A previous study showed that in the US, after correcting for misclassification of Klatskin, the incidence of ECC may be stable or increasing slightly.8

The less strong association of ECC than ICC with major liver diseases and cancer risk factors, such as HBV and HCV infections, alcohol, and NAFLD is also compatible with more favourable incidence and mortality trends of ECC.

Still, primary sclerosing cholangitis is also a relevant risk factor, particularly for ECC in the USA and northern Europe.32

Thus, at least part of the fall in ECC mortality in those countries may reflect improved management of primary sclerosing cholangitis.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, our study provides strong confirmatory evidence on a global increase in mortality from ICC, whose causes need to be better understood by conducting targeted investigations.

Such studies should consider ICC separately from ECC.
