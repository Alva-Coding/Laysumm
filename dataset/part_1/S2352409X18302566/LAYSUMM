TITLE

The Corded Ware culture in the Eastern Baltic: New evidence on chronology, diet, beaker, bone and flint tool function

PARAGRAPH

We present new AMS radiocarbon measurements and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data obtained on human bone collagen, molecular and isotopic data obtained from ceramic beakers, and user-wear data of flint and bone tools from several CWC graves in Lithuania and Western Belarus.

The bone collagen stable isotope data demonstrate that the majority of consumed protein was derived from terrestrial resources.

Organic residue analysis of two CWC beakers yielded lipids consistent with ruminant carcass and dairy fats, whilst use-wear analyses indicates that bone pins, flint blades and axes were used as grinders, functional tools or had been carefully renewed before deposition respectively.
