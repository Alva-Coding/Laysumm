TITLE

Conjoint glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 and P/Q voltage gated calcium channel antibodies in autoimmune epilepsy: A case report

PARAGRAPH

Autoimmune epilepsy is a relatively rare type of epilepsy that was recently recognized by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE).

Usually, patients with this disorder present with behavioral changes, cognitive impairement, and drug resistant focal seizures.

Serum and cerebrospinal fluid levels of antineuronal antibodies is high in these patients.

Most effective treatment options include steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, plama exchange, in addition to immunosuppressants.

We describe a young adult with drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy who was found to have two antineuronal antibodies (glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 and P/Q voltage gated calcium channel antibodies).

This patient responded well to steroid therapy.
