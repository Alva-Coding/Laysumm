TITLE

LA-ICP-MS labels early medieval Tuscan finds from Siena and Donoratico as late natron glass

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

This study aims to increase the insight into the working processes and glassware trade in Italy during the transition time between the end of the Roman period and the beginning of the Middle Ages, including the type of materials used for glassmaking and for improving its quality.

Both Roman and medieval glass have been extensively studied in the past (see e.g. Janssens, 2013) and further studies have been dedicated to the exploration of the effective onset of the new processes leading to typical Medieval glass compositions„ i.e., based on vegetable ash as a flux in place of natural evaporites.

Recent studies on late Antique and early Medieval glass from Italy have revealed co-existence of several glass compositions from the 4-5th century onwards, almost all natron-based and mainly compatible with the previously identified HIMT, Strong HIMT, Levantine and Série 3.2 glass groups, next to earlier Roman blue-green glass (Gliozzo et al., 2015, 2016, 2017; Silvestri et al., 2017; Gallo et al., 2014; Maltoni et al., 2015, 2016; Silvestri and Marcante, 2011), while a few objects dated to the 6-7th century, and 6-11th, excavated in the Tuscan site of San Genesio already featured a vegetable ash glass composition (Cagno et al., 2012).

In order to expand our knowledge on this transition, in particular in the Tuscan area, we have selected glass samples that are precisely dated to the period from the 5th to 8th century and originate from the Santa Maria della Scala site in Siena, Italy, next to a small set of later, clearly early medieval glasses dated to the 10–11th century from the same site and to the 11-12th century from the village of Donoratico, in the same region.

SECTION

The historical sites of Santa Maria della Scala and Donoratico

PARAGRAPH

The hospital of Santa Maria della Scala is located in the center of Siena, Piazza Duomo, in front of the cathedral.

It was one of the oldest and largest hospitals in Europe and one of the first xenodochi (free hospice for pilgrims and strangers).

The hospital has maintained its activities until 1995, when the premises were given a new destination, namely that of a museum (Complesso Museale Santa Maria Della Scala).

Today, it is one of the leading museums and cultural centers in the city.

In this hospital, St. Catherine of Siena (14th century) and San Bernardino (15th century) provided their charitable activities.

PARAGRAPH

The archaeological excavation of Santa Maria della Scala started in July 1998 and ended in 2005; the excavations were headed by Dr. Riccardo Francovich and Dr. Daniele Manacorda whereas the glass findings were dealt with by Dr. Marja Mendera, all of the University of Siena.

The survey has allowed us to study consistent stratigraphic deposits dating from the 5th to the 11th century CE, which were discovered well below 15 hospital rooms, set on three levels, along the medieval inner road.

Numerous fragments of glassy materials were found but no signs of glass production were uncovered.

This excavation has been essential to gather more information about the history of Siena because written sources until the advent of the Middle Ages are non-existing (Cantini, 2005; Francovich, 2007).

PARAGRAPH

Donoratico is located in the town of Castagneto Carducci, in the province of Livorno (Tuscany).

The castle of Donoratico is placed on top of a large hilly plateau of almost a hectare, located at 129 m above sea level, at 3.75 km from the line of the Tyrrhenian coast and 2.5 km south of the center of Castagneto Carducci (Fig. 1).

This castle is famous for having hosted a figure such as Ugolino della Gherardesca, who was owner of the castle in the 13th century and was quoted by Dante Alighieri in his Divina Commedia.

As is the case in Siena, the historical and literary sources on Donoratico are fairly limited; the village is mentioned for the first time in 1161, when a document stipulates that the Della Gherardesca are recognized as the Domini of the area (Bianchi, 2004; Francovich and Bianchi, 2006).

PARAGRAPH

An archaeological research project started in Donoratico in 2000 and is still ongoing.

The results have yielded additional knowledge of the historical castle of the village, especially with regard to its premedieval period.

The excavations were headed by Dr. Riccardo Francovich and Dr.Giuliana Bianchi of the University of Siena.

SECTION

The analysed glass finds

PARAGRAPH

5 samples (11th–12th century) were selected from the Donoratico finds and 44 samples were selected from those excavated at Santa Maria della Scala (mainly 5–8th century, for more details please see Table A.4).

The majority of the glassware analysed, 33 samples, were green/light green in colour; the remaining are yellow, brown or colourless.

An overview of the main characteristics of the glass fragments can be found in the Appendix (Table A.4), but the main glass shapes found at both sites are represented in Table 1, and examples of the typical size and state of conservation of the samples are provided in Fig. 2.

While in the set of 5-8th century glass from Siena, several shapes are represented, the few examples of later glass have been selected for comparison purposes.

PARAGRAPH

From an observation of the Santa Maria della Scala samples in Siena, the use of glass artefacts in Siena between the end of the 5th and 8th century did not appear to differ from other Italian locations of the same period (Cantini, 2005).

Only a limited amount of shapes were observed, nor did they display any significant morphological changes throughout the early Middle Ages.

Among the analysed glass findings, there were 5 wine glass stems (four smooth and one twisted, all from Donoratico), 22 stem glasses, 8 bottles, 11 lamps, 1 drinking glass, 1 bowl and 1 unguentarium.

Of the 8 bottles examined, four displayed a stemless and slightly indented bottom, two display one side with a globular ring, one has an outward flaring border and one with a stemless bottom and the beginning of a globular ring along one of the sides.

Of the 11 lamps found in Santa Maria della Scala, 3 were conical with drop-shaped bottom, four were Isings 134 style glass (Isings, 1957), two have a band border, one has an Uboldi IV.2 and another has an Uboldi II.2 shape (Uboldi, 1995).

Some examples of the glass found on site are given in Fig. 2.

SECTION

Experimental

PARAGRAPH

All glass samples were analysed at the University of Antwerp, by means of a NWR193 excimer laser, combined with an Agilent 7700X ICP-MS system.

The experimental parameters can be found in Table 2.

PARAGRAPH

A pre-cleaning of the surface was performed with a wider laser-beam than that used for actual ablation (150 vs. 100 μm diameter).

A laser repetition rate of 10 Hz for pre-cleaning and 20 Hz for ablation along a 2 mm long line, with a translation speed of 0.07 mm/s for pre-cleaning and 0.02 mm/s for ablation were employed.

A laser output energy of 150 mJ, generating a fluence of 8 J cm−2 on the sample surface was used throughout all of the measurements.

PARAGRAPH

The most important ICP-MS instrument settings (carrier gas flow rate and RF power) were optimised, aiming at a maximum signal-to-noise ratio and low oxide ion and doubly charged ion formation, by employing the signal intensities obtained by ablating the glass reference material NIST SRM 610.

PARAGRAPH

Quantification was performed with a set of standards, consisting of Corning Museum of Glass (CMG) standards B and D as well a NIST SRM 610 and a NIST SRM 612 standard.

Due to the matrix dependency of laser ablation, different standards will produce different sensitivity factors.

Based on the quantification protocol of van Elteren et al. (2009), we used a linear combination of standards.

The algorithm is briefly discussed below, but the performance of the algorithm is discussed in detail in Cagno et al. (2016).

PARAGRAPH

For both samples and standards, the time-dependent background-corrected signal Ii is normalised for internal standard IS: Ii,norm=IiIIS×cISwhere IIS is the time-dependent signal of the internal standard and cIS its concentration.

When no supplementary technique is available for the determination of the concentration of the internal standard, a initial guess is used.

In this study, 44Ca was used as internal standard with an estimated concentration of 10 w%.

PARAGRAPH

For the standards, the sensitivity factor Si for an elemental oxide i is calculated by making use of the time-average of the normalised signal: Si=Ii,normstcist

PARAGRAPH

If the analysed glass fragments do not match any of the standards, we can use a different strategy, where we combine different standards based on the Euclidean distance between the sample x and all available standards (index j) to obtain an average sensitivity factor: Si,x=∑jkrx,j×Si,jrx,j=1∑ici,j−ci,x2×∑j=1k1∑ici,j−ci,x2−1where

Si,j: the sensitivity factors calculated from Eq. (2)

ci,x: initial guess of the concentration of oxide i, obtained from a quantification with all standards

ci,j: concentration of oxide i in standard j

PARAGRAPH

The concentration ci (%m/m) of elemental oxide i can be determined by means ofci=Ii,normSi=cistIi,normIi,normst

PARAGRAPH

In glass analysis, we can make an additional correction, since glass is made up almost entirely out of oxides.

Thus, if we convert all quantified elements to its most common oxides, and assume that we have quantified all present oxides, the accumulated concentration of all oxides ci should sum up to ct, wherect=∑inci=100%

PARAGRAPH

Based on the total oxide concentration ct, we can normalise all oxide concentrations: ci,norm=100%×cict

PARAGRAPH

All calculations performed for the quantification results presented in this articles were performed in Matlab (© MathWorks), as well as the principal component analysis presented in Section 3.1.

The principal component analysis was performed on all element concentration data and no normalisation or other data treatment was used to obtain the results presented in Fig. 3.

Results

SECTION

Glass types

PARAGRAPH

A principal component analysis allowed us to identify 4 separate groups.

These were the following: a large group, characterised by generally positive PC1 and PC2 scores, identified by blue stars in Fig. 3, a smaller group with negative PC2 scores identified by green triangles; four samples with highly negative PC1 scores identified by red squares, and three intermediate samples identified by purple diamonds (see Fig. 3).

All Donoratico glasses fall all into the same group together with a large part of Santa Maria della Scala glass.

The classification and the origin of the names used for the groups is discussed further in this section, after the discussion on the fluxing agent.

PARAGRAPH

In Fig. 4, the ternary plot is presented for the normalised concentration of Na2O, CaO and K2O + MgO.

This ternary plot allows to identify the alkali source used as a flux in the glass production.

Mineral silica-soda-lime glass, vegetable silica-soda-lime ash glass, mixed alkali glass and potash glass can be distinguished from one another (Gratuze, 2004).

All glass samples in this study can be classified as mineral silica soda-lime glass, regardless of their provenance.

PARAGRAPH

Mineral silica soda-lime glass is characterised by high NaO content and low concentrations of potash and magnesium.

This composition is typical of the Roman era, when mineral natron was used as a fluxing agent.

From Table A.4, we can also see elevated Cl levels (over 1%) for all samples, consistent with the presence of NaCl impurities in raw natron (Shortland, 2004).

PARAGRAPH

After the breakdown of the Western Roman empire, in Western Europe, glassmakers gradually switched to the use of vegetable ashes as fluxing agents, resulting in higher concentrations for K2O and MgO in the glass.

However, the switch to plant ash as a fluxing agent was a slow and gradual, supply-driven process (Shortland et al., 2006) and as it can be seen in Table A.4, all the glass part of this study has low K2O (<1%) and MgO (<2%)concentrations, which is consistent with natron-based Roman glass (see e.g. Sayre and Smith, 1961; Jackson, 2005; Silvestri et al., 2005, 2008; Jackson et al., 1991; Janssens, 2013).

It is remarkable that a few glass finds found at sites in the same region (San Genesio (Cagno et al., 2012)) and similar period already had a plant-ash composition.

PARAGRAPH

The four groups identified by the PCA were compared with published results of Late Antique Italian glass found from the 4-5th century, and they were named according to the similarities found with existing glass classes.

This revealed a distinction can be made: all accessory elements have negative loadings on PC1, while iron and iron ore related elements feature positive loadings aligned on PC2, opposed to negative loadings for lead and tin (see Fig. 3).

The groups were named as follows:

PARAGRAPH

This classification will be used throughout the article.

The Intermediate group, while shown in the figures and tables, contains too few samples (3) to be statistically relevant and will consequently not discussed in the text.

HIMT is a type of late Roman glass attributed to primary East Mediterranean production sites, likely in the Egyptian area (Freestone et al., 2002; Freestone and Gorin-Rosen, 2002; Freestone and Hughes, 2006).

In particular, a similarity can be found between the first of our groups and the HIMT2 subtype described by Foster and Jackson (2009), otherwise described as weak HIMT (Foster and Jackson, 2009; Rosenow and Rehren, 2014).

Levantine glass is a type of late Roman glass, originating from the Syro-Palestinian coast, which coexisted with HIMT glass, and which had a likely more costly production process, resulting in a different distribution in the West (Maltoni et al., 2016; Schibille et al., 2016; Phelps et al., 2016).

Strong HIMT (also identified as HIMT1) glass identified by Foster and Jackson (2009) and Group 1 by Foy et al. (2003), is a glass class characterised by particularly high levels of iron and associated elements.

The intermediate group is made of three samples, which have only some features of the abovementioned three groups, and might have resulted from glass recycling.

All the latest studies involving late Antique glass from the Italian peninsula found a co-existence of the said compositions, next to other minor ones, albeit with different relative abundances (Ceglia et al., 2017; Gliozzo et al., 2015, 2016, 2017; Silvestri et al., 2017; Gallo et al., 2014; Maltoni et al., 2015; Maltoni et al., 2016; Schibille et al., 2016; Silvestri and Marcante, 2011; Phelps et al., 2016).

PARAGRAPH

The concentrations of Fe2O3 and MnO for most of the samples in the HIMT and Levantine groups (see Fig. 5) are consistent with the natural amounts present in sand (Jackson, 2005).

A part of them, and all the Strong HIMT samples have a higher Mn concentration (>1% MnO): according to Jackson (2005) this indicates deliberate addition of a Mn compound by the glassmaker, while other sources (Brems and Degryse, 2013) estimate this threshold even lower, indicating manganese was added intentionally.

Since iron ions (Fe2+, Fe3+) colour the glass, iron can be added specifically to obtain a green or yellow tint.

However, since both the concentration of iron, as well as its oxidation state determine the colour of the glass (Ceglia et al., 2014), when a high iron content originates from impurities in the raw materials, manganese can be added to decolourise glass by influencing the redox equilibrium between Fe2+ and Fe3+, causing a shift from green to yellow hues (e.g. Green and Hart, 1987; Ceglia et al., 2013).

PARAGRAPH

For the groups studied here, the relation between their composition and colour is very clear.

All glass samples from the HIMT and Levantine groups are either colourless or lightly coloured, whereas the fragments from the Strong HIMT group, are either yellow or green.

PARAGRAPH

From Fig. 6 it is possible to gain a better understanding of the lime/feldspar content of the sand that was used during the glassmaking.

This biplot has been widely used to highlight the distinction between HIMT and Levantine glass types (Freestone et al., 2002; Gliozzo et al., 2016; Maltoni et al., 2015, 2016; Silvestri and Marcante, 2011), whose compositional boundaries are also reported for clarity.

Most samples fall around the same correlation line, and besides some samples falling slightly below, or in-between the respective boxes, which might be a result of recycling glasses with different compositions, the main exception is the Strong HIMT group, which appears to have a different Ca:Al correlation, possibly indicating a different geological origin of the silica source.

PARAGRAPH

For a clear comparison, an overview of the most important major and trace elements for relevant literature groups and the glasses analysed in this study can be found in Table 3.

SECTION

Colouring agents and evidence for recycling

PARAGRAPH

Evidence indicates that it was common practice in Roman times to introduce some flakes from bronze alloys in the fusing mix to create different colour shades thanks to the colouring property of the copper contained in the bronze (Brill, 1992, 1999; Sayre and Smith, 1961; Sayre, 1963); this has already been observed in glassware found in Pompeii (De Francesco et al., 2010) and was also hypothesized in blueish glass of the same age from San Genesio (Cagno et al., 2012).

However, as can be seen in Fig. 7, the Pb, Cu, and Sn concentrations are highly correlated.

At the end of the Late Antiquity recycling of glass became more frequent (Foster and Jackson, 2009), which may cause glass composition to be encountered that deviate from the classic groups shown in Fig. 4 and Table 3.

Possible indications for glass recycling have been proposed by Foy et al. (2003).

Foy had found copper, lead and antimony concentrations to be respectively ≤90 ppm, ≤200 ppm and ≤100 ppm in unrecycled glass.

From Fig. 7 it becomes evident that these values (indicated by dashed lines) have been exceeded for several samples, suggesting either intentional or incidental addition, through which the three elements entered the glass via an additional ingredient of the batch.

PARAGRAPH

Additionally, for many HIMT, some Levantine and all Intermediate samples, we see an increased antimony concentration (above ca. 1000 ppm), not consistent with the natural correlation.

This appears also be a sign of increased recycling of opaque glass chunks in the glass melt, as this can be related to the use of antimony as an opacifier in the form of calcium antimonate Ca2Sb2O7.

For example, opaque beads and mosaic tiles may have been added to the glass melt.

Therefore, re-use of left over pieces of coloured or opaque glasses appears the most likely explanation of the co-occurrence of these elements.

PARAGRAPH

Another possible indication of recycling is the presence of MnO amounts between 1 and 2% in glasses with relatively low Fe2O3 contents.

A plausible interpretation of these data is that, as the iron concentration in increasingly recycled glass gradually increased, the addition of Mn compounds to decolourize it became commonplace.

The Strong HIMT group contains far less ancillary colourants/opacifiers (besides Fe) in comparison to the two other groups, indicating that these glass samples were less affected by increased recycling in the Late Antique/early medieval age, perhaps because more intensely coloured glass chunks offered less possibilities for different colouration/decolouration to the artisans, and therefore they were simply recycled as green glass.

SECTION

Trace elements

PARAGRAPH

To gain a better insight into the dissimilarity of the source of the sand used in the production of the Santa Maria della Scala and Donoratico glass, the Ti, Zr and Hf trace level concentrations were considered (Fig. 8).

A given source of sand can be characterised by the minerals it contains such as zircon and ilmenite, which typically contain zirconium and titanium, respectively.

Hafnium on the other hand is an accessory element in the zircon mineral, therefore it usually shows a good correlation with Zr in glass.

A strong correlation between the Zr and Ti concentrations and the occurrence of similar concentration levels of these elements would indicate the use of sand from a similar geological origin.

From Fig. 8a we can see the same Ti to Zr ratio between different groups, suggesting that all glass samples were made with a silica source with similar features such as coastal sands, for instance (Aerts et al., 2003).

Additionally, from Fig. 8b, we can deduce additional information about the purity of the sand.

The lower levels of Hf and Zr (below 50 ppm) indicate the use of pure quartz sand or crushed quartz sand, whereas higher concentrations indicate more commonly encountered sand, such as a coastal one.

The trace element signatures of the three groups discussed here show a strong resemblance to the reference data sets from Table 3, as did the major elements, previously discussed in Section 3.1.

In the Strong HIMT group a very high Zr content can be observed (up to ≈400 ppm, see Table 3), similar to previous research (SG2b from Cagno et al. (2012) and Group 1 from Foy et al. (2003)), confirming that for production of coloured glass, the purity of the sand was not a critical parameter.

For the other groups, the Zr content is significantly lower (≤100 ppm, Table 3), confirming there is similarity with the SG1 group from San Genesio.

PARAGRAPH

While examining the continental crust-normalised REE concentrations (Fig. 9), in the HIMT and Levantine groups, we can see an enrichment of Sr and depletion of the other elements, consistent with the use of quartz-bearing sands, similar, when hypothesizing an Eastern Mediterranean origin, to sand sources from the Levantine coast (Freestone et al., 2000; Schibille et al., 2013; Arletti et al., 2010) and the trace element pattern of the Belus river sands (Brems and Degryse, 2013).

The Strong HIMT group is remarkably different from these, richer in all elements but Sr and Rb, showing another geological source of the sand used for glassmaking.

The higher Ba concentration in the Strong HIMT group can also be correlated to the addition of Mn compounds, as Ba is a typical impurity in Mn ores (Silvestri et al., 2008; Jackson, 2005; Paynter, 2006; Foster and Jackson, 2010).

SECTION

Conclusion

PARAGRAPH

This study improves our current knowledge on the complex panorama of glass consumption from the end of the Roman era onwards.

In the 5th to 8th century the glass consumed in Siena was made with natron as a fluxing agent as well as the later glass from the same site and from Donoratico, and the main glass group identified by this study is High Iron, Manganese and Titanium (HIMT) glass.

Next to it, and with a lower occurrency samples of Levantine composition are found, and some glasses with composition consistent with the Strong HIMT glass group.

PARAGRAPH

For a large group of the analysed glass, high concentration levels for trace elements such as Pb, Sn, Cu and Sb are found.

This may possibly indicate that opaque/coloured glass (known as external cullet) containing these elements was increasingly added to the batch.

PARAGRAPH

The compositions found and the (likely) recycling indicators found offer a similar picture as that of other late Antique sites excavated in the Italian peninsula.

PARAGRAPH

In all three groups the silica source was found to match a coastal sand signature, based mainly on the REE and Zr contents, although a clear distinction in sand purity was visible between the Strong HIMT group on the one hand and the others.

This may be correlated to the fact that all Strong HIMT samples were originally meant to be coloured and that consequently, sand purity (i.e. to make clear glass) was a less critical parameter for this specific glass type.

Besides, Strong HIMT glasses show no clear evidence for increased recycling or remelting.

PARAGRAPH

These results would suggest that the glass found at Donoratico and Siena likely originates from a glassworking site where, according to the Roman practice, raw glass from the Levant was remelted and shaped.

While natron glass was available into the 2nd millennium CE, the likely increased scarcity of raw natron glass supplied from the Levant gave rise to a more extensive recycling behaviour which is testified by selected minor elements described in this paper.
