TITLE

Exploring ecodynamics of coastal foragers using integrated faunal records from Čḯxwicən village (Strait of Juan de Fuca, Washington, U.S.A.)

PARAGRAPH

Analysis of over one million animal bones, teeth and shells from Čḯxwicən (pronounced ch-WHEET-son) village, coastal Washington State, shows that Indigenous people relied on over 100 species of shellfish, fish, birds, and mammals for over 2000 years.

Animals and in turn people, coped with large-magnitude earthquakes, and changes in climate and coastal habitat.

Tsunamis affected shellfish and fish more than mammals and birds.

People were resilient to such impacts: they returned, rebuilt, and adapted to changed environments.

Two households responded differently to one tsunami, which tells us that the impact of “disasters” on communities depends on social conditions.
