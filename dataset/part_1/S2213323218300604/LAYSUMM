TITLE

Epileptic spasms as the presenting seizure type in a patient with a new “O” of TORCH, congenital Zika virus infection

PARAGRAPH

The term Epileptic Spasms (ES) refers to a severe seizure disorder that often presents in infancy with a characteristic EEG pattern known as hypasarrythmia.

ES has many causes, many of which involve structural changes to the brain.

We describe an infant with in utero Zika virus infection, a virus known to disrupt fetal brain development, who develops ES.

We review changes to the infant’s brain structure and EEG patterns and discuss the response to treatment.

In addition to illustrating the links between brain structure and function, this case reaffirms the importance of monitoring infants with congenital infections for ES development.
