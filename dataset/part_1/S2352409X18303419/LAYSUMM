TITLE

Discovery of the Jomon era maize weevils in Hokkaido, Japan and its mean

PARAGRAPH

The Jomon vessels that have impressions of maize weevils dated between ca. 5000 and 4000 years BP have been discovered in southern Hokkaido, Japan.

One of them has more than 500 adult weevils that were mixed into clay.

The geographical and temporal distribution of these vessels suggests a possibility of the human-mediated diffusion of maize weevils and chestnut cultivation across oceanic barriers by the Jomon people lived in the northern Tohoku region, because chestnut tree had not been native to Hokkaido before that time originally.
