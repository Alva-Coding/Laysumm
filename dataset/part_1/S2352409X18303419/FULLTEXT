Origin and diffusion

PARAGRAPH

Maize weevils (Sitophilus zeamais), rice weevils (S. oryzae), and granary weevils (S. granarius) are common harmful pest insects that infest stored food products in the modern world.

Although all three species are cosmopolitan insects causing great damage to human products today, the former two are also characteristic to modern Japan (Harada, 1971).

These two species were previously cosmopolitan throughout the warmer parts of the world but granary weevils, a temperate species, have replaced rice and maize weevils in Europe and North America (Harada, 1971).

They are thought to be that insects that originated in the forest in the southern foothills of Himalayas, diverged from the same ancestor, and had spread across the old world along with the beginning of agriculture.

And it is suggested that granary weevils had spread by adjusting to barley and wheat cultivation in Western Asia and Europe, while maize weevils and rice weevils adjusted to rice cultivation in Eastern Asia (Plarre, 2010).

Although there is abundant archaeological record of the grain weevils in Europe and Southwestern Asia (Buckland, 1990; Panagiotakopulu and Buckland, 1991), we have the only example of rice weevils infesting barley in a grave from the Han Dynasty (2118 BP) in East Asia (Yasue, 1959; Yasue, 1976).

SECTION

Distribution and foods

PARAGRAPH

The global distribution of these insects occurred relatively recently, and they have continued to spread as a result of worldwide cereal trading during the 20th century.

The granary weevil is a flightless and fully synanthropic species, while rice and maize weevils can fly and are often observed in wheat and maize fields before harvest (Plarre, 2010).

The modern rice weevil in Japan is, however, also a flightless species (Yasutomi and Umeya, 2000).

It is commonly known that maize weevils feed on stored cereals, especially maize, rice, barley and wheat.

However, maize weevils also feed on fruits such as peaches or apples in North America, and they may inhabit forests and grasslands in addition to grain storage facilities (Harada, 1971).

They are also often discovered in the acorns with broken shells.

A feeding and breeding experiment showed that adult maize weevils feed on a wide range of food—37 families and 96 species of plants including the above cereals, while the larvae feed on a more limited variety comprising 11 families and 31 species of plants.

The plant seeds and fruits need to be of sufficient volume and nutritional quality (including adequate starch content) to support the development of larvae for at least one generation; such species include acorns and cereal grains (Harada, 1971).

PARAGRAPH

In winter, modern maize weevils stay under layers of leaf litter or in shallow earth in a dormant state.

After awakening in spring, they swarm to flowers to suck the nectar.

However, because they are poor fliers, their home range is restricted to <400 m from their habitat (e.g. human storage facilities).

This implies that a population in one village cannot mate with populations in neighbouring villages located just a few kilometres away (Yoshida et al., 1956).

Therefore, their propagation over distant territories likely requires the human-mediated transport of infested foods (Plarre, 2010; Corrêa et al., 2017).

Identification and discoveries of Jomon weevils

SECTION

Identification

PARAGRAPH

We previously published a study on weevil impressions on pottery from Jomon sites (Obata et al., 2011).

However, some doubt was expressed in the academic community regarding our identification of these weevils as maize weevils (Sitophilus zeamais) (Corrêa et al., 2017).

We did not show the detail diagnostic characteristics to identify these samples as maize weevils in the paper.

Therefore, we show them below.

PARAGRAPH

Adult rice weevils and adult maize weevils have round or irregularly shaped punctations on the thorax and other parts of the body, while adult granary weevils have elongated punctations.

The negative lines formed by them on the thorax are wider than the positive lines between the punctations.

These characteristics were observed on positive casts of weevil impressions from various Jomon sites as well as on fossils from the Sannai-Maruyama site (Fig. 1).

Generally, the maize weevil is approximately one-and-a-half times the length and three times the weight of the rice weevil, with a mean body length of approximately 4 mm (Harada, 1971).

Aside from body size, the morphological characteristics of maize weevils are almost identical to those of rice weevils; thus, the two species are morphologically almost indistinguishable (Corrêa et al., 2017).

However, there are a few classificatory criteria for differentiating between the two species—namely, the shapes of the scutellum and the third flagellum of the antennae (Yasutomi and Umeya, 2000; Yoshida et al., 2001).

However, these structures are very small and fragile, making it difficult to observe them on weevil fossils or on positive casts of weevil impressions.

Judging from four examples from the Sannai-Maruyama site, representing both fossils and impressions, the sample scutella clearly exhibited the morphological characteristics of maize weevils (Fig. 1 (a–d, g–h, k–l) (Obata, 2014a).

Two examples of positive casts from other Jomon sites showed the same characteristics (Fig. 1 (e–f, i–j, m–n).

PARAGRAPH

Furthermore, we observed that the Jomon weevils, represented mainly by pottery impressions from many sites and a small number of fossils, were larger than modern maize weevils (Obata et al., 2011) and other Ancient and Medieval Age maize weevils (Fig. 2).

The average length of both the elytra and thorax of the maize weevils from the Sannai-Maruyama site were significantly larger (p < 0.0001) than that of maize weevils from the Korokan and Kiyosu Castle sites.

There were no significant differences observed between the Korokan and Kiyosu Castle maize weevils (the Fujiwara-kyo site produced too few samples to be included in the statistical analyses).

Aside from the larger body size, all other characteristics suggested the species Sitophilus zeamais.

SECTION

History of discoveries and distribution of the prehistoric maize weevils

PARAGRAPH

Before maize weevil impressions were discovered in Jomon vessels, the oldest specimens known were fossils from the Ikegame site, dating to the Middle Yayoi period (ca. 2000 cal BP).

Fossils of maize weevils have also been reported for the Fujiwara Palace ruins and the Korokan ruins (one of the official guesthouses of ancient times), which both date to the eighth century AD, and for Kiyosu Castle Town from the Middle Ages, which dates to the sixteenth century AD (Obata, 2016a; Obata, 2016b).

PARAGRAPH

The oldest maize weevil impressions (ca. 10,000 cal BP) in Japan were discovered in 2010 on potsherds from the Sanbonmatsu archaeological site on Tanegashima Island (Obata et al., 2011), about 50 km south of the southern tip of Kyushu Island.

This discovery contradicts the hypothesis that the maize weevil came to Japan with rice from the Korean Peninsula in the beginning (ca. 4000 cal BP) (Yamazaki, 2005) or in the middle (ca. 3500 cal BP) (Obata, 2008) of the Late Jomon period, and it demonstrates that their earliest adaptation to a manmade environment occurred in the absence of any cultivated cereals.

In 2012, the northernmost examples of maize weevil impressions and fossils (dated between ca. 6000 and 5000 cal BP) were discovered at the Sannai-Maruyama site in Aomori Prefecture (Obata, 2014a; Obata and Manabe, 2014).

This suggests that prehistoric maize weevils had a broader habitat and a stronger link to human populations than previously suspected (Obata, 2016a).

Further discoveries of maize weevil impressions continue to this day, with an increasing number of potsherds becoming available for examination.

PARAGRAPH

The number of discoveries of maize weevil fossils is still small; however, this is changing rapidly with ever-increasing discoveries of weevil impressions, especially from the Jomon period.

Since our 2011 count (Obata et al., 2011), the number of sites containing specimens has increased by ~2.6-fold, while the number of impressions has increased by 18-fold.

PARAGRAPH

In the winter of 2013, we were finally able to discover the maize weevil impressions from a Jomon site in the southern part of Hokkaido (Obata, 2017).

Therefore we now have access to 439 weevil impressions from 55 sites in 60 phases (Fig. 3, Table 1).

The discovery at the Tatesaki site (the main focus of this article) has contributed the second most to increasing the number of specimens next to ones at the Motonobaru site over the past seven years.

If the Tatesaki specimens are excluded, the specimens from the Late Jomon site in Kyushu comprise the majority.

However, this does not necessarily accurately represent the original distribution in the Jomon period; rather, this is attributable to the many investigations performed at the archaeological sites in Kyushu.

The analysis of weevil impressions has only recently seen significant interest, and many regions and sites remain ‘untouched’ with regards to such specimens.

This study represents the first investigation of the Tatesaki site in Hokkaido, and the maize weevil impressions from this site are the earliest such remains in Hokkaido.

Their discovery also implies that maize weevils were distributed more widely in the Jomon period than previously thought.

PARAGRAPH

On the other hand, specimens of maize weevil impressions are relatively rare in pottery from the later Yayoi and Kofun periods.

One possible reason for the fewer specimens compared to the Jomon period is the smaller number of investigations performed to date at sites from these periods.

However, changes in pottery-making methods over time were most likely responsible for the reduced number of weevil impressions, as later potters tended to remove obstructive seeds or insects from the clay to produce vessels with fewer impurities.

SECTION

Ecology of maize weevils in the Jomon period

PARAGRAPH

Archaeological evidence strongly suggests that maize weevils were synanthropic species living in Jomon houses, based on the significant numbers and wide distribution of maize weevil impressions and fossil remains across Jomon sites.

The seed and fruit impressions observed on Jomon pottery are mainly of cultivated plants or plants useful to the Jomon people (Obata, 2014b), which suggest that these plants too were synanthropic species introduced into houses for processing, storing or cooking.

We know, of course, that rodents and birds can bring acorns with maize weevil eggs into the nests they build inside houses.

However, the substantial number of maize weevils uncovered at the Jomon sites indicates that they were pest insects thriving in these human habitats rather than wild invaders.

Investigations of Jomon-period pottery show a high density of adult maize weevil impressions, comprising ~90% of all insect impressions found at the Jomon sites (Obata, 2013), and this trend has been observed at Jomon sites across Japan.

Both the high density of household pest insects and cultivated plants in the impressions indirectly demonstrate indoor pottery making during this time.

PARAGRAPH

Like the Sannai-Maruyama site (where >120 maize weevil fossils and 19 impressions were discovered), maize weevil remains have been discovered at many other sites located in areas with cooler climates.

Although maize weevils tolerate cooler climates better than rice weevils, the most suitable temperature for their propagation is 28–29 °C and breeding is suppressed at temperatures below 15 °C (Harada, 1971).

Thus, the discovery of maize weevils in the cooler areas of Japan suggests that manmade environments—such as pit houses and storage facilities—offered suitably warm and humid conditions for diapause in winter and reproduction in summer.

Synanthropy would therefore have enabled their propagation and adaptation to climates that were otherwise inhospitable (Obata, 2016a; Obata, 2016b).

SECTION

Description of the Tatesaki site and maize weevil impressions

PARAGRAPH

The Tatesaki site is located on the southernmost tip of Hokkaido, approximately 6 km northeast of Cape Shirakami.

This site has been dated from the latter half of the Early Jomon period (ca. 5000 BP) to the early part of the Late Jomon period (ca. 4000 BP).

Excavations carried out between 2009 and 2011 revealed 51 pit houses, 119 pits, and one pottery midden, 1.5 m high.

Numerous artefacts were collected from this pottery midden, including 910,000 potsherds and 480,000 fragments of stone implements.

The majority of artefacts collected from this site—the largest base settlement in the area—have been dated to approximately the same time as the peak occupation of the Sannai-Maruyama site on the opposite shore (Fukui and Kageura, 2016).

PARAGRAPH

Between 2013 and 2016, we examined 1200 vessels from this site using microscopy (40× magnification).

Specimens containing seed, fruit or insect impressions were separated, and 197 positive cast models were made using silicone gum.

These impressions were then identified and photographed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM).

We discovered 96 impressions of maize weevils among 11 vessels belonging to the era between the latter half of the Early Jomon period and the early part of the Late Jomon period.

Of those impressions, 85 were from a single vessel (TSK 484) dating to the early part of the Late Jomon period (Fig. 4) (Obata, 2017).

SECTION

Materials and methods

PARAGRAPH

In this study, we analysed weevil remains in archaeological contexts in Hokkaido, which constitute the first discovery of the maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) in this region and estimated their main infested foodstuff and propagations system.

PARAGRAPH

At first, in order to know the accurate number transition of maize weevils over time at the Tatesaki site, we should search the true number of weevil impressions in and on the vessels from the Tatesaki site.

Actually, seed or insect impressions were not formed by pressing to the surface of the pottery after the pottery formation, but they were introduced into the pottery clay during pottery making.

Therefore, seeds and insects introduced into the pottery clay appeared as two types of impressions (cavities).

One is an exposed impression of the surface of pottery.

The other is an unexposed one which is not visible to the naked eye on or from the surface of pottery.

To solve the issue, we examine the true number of impressions of maize weevils both on the surface of vessels and internal part of the walls of vessels with X-ray instruments.

PARAGRAPH

Secondly, we compared the distribution and size of maize weevil impressions with archaeological evidence of foodstuffs to evaluate the factors causing morphological variations in weevils during the Jomon period.

With this evidence, we discussed the possibility of the propagation of maize weevils by the Jomon people to north-eastern Japan, through the transport of infested foodstuffs from the Tohoku region to Hokkaido across the Tsugaru Strait.

SECTION

Examination of cavities within the walls of the Tatesaki vessels and potsherds

PARAGRAPH

All ten vessels with visible (‘exposed’) maize weevil impressions (TSK 3014 was too large to observe in the equipment and was therefore excluded) were further examined with soft X-rays to find hidden cavities inside the clay.

We next used X-ray computed tomography (CT) of potsherds from vessels TSK 484 and TSK 285 to validate our identification of silhouettes observed with soft X-rays as maize weevil impressions.

The total number of maize weevil impressions on and inside the vessels was then estimated with the following procedure: 1) To identify the exposed impressions, we visually examined the whole surface of each vessel and then made positive casts with silicone rubber for further analysis with SEM.

2) To obtain sectional images of the vessels we scanned them with an X-ray CT scanner.

3) To identify the unexposed impressions as maize weevil impressions, we compared the morphology and size of each impression observed by X-ray CT with that of the exposed impressions.

4) To ensure the accuracy of the identifications, we compared the morphology and size of the unexposed impressions with reconstructed three-dimensional (3-D) images of the individual maize weevils by X-ray CT. 5) To find a clue of causes of mixing maize weevils in the vessel clay, we calculated the number of exposed and unexposed impressions per unit area (100 cm2) and compared the density of these impressions for each vessel.

SECTION

Estimation of ecology of maize weevils from the Tatesaki site

PARAGRAPH

Of the 55 sites which yield weevil impressions, 52 belong to the Jomon period, four to the Yayoi period and two to the Kofun period.

We measured the weevil body sizes at each site by preparing 337 replicas of specimens from 43 sites that had been preserved in our laboratory except 4 specimens from 3 sites, which were measured with SEM images in the reports.

Measurements were taken of specimens from the Jomon and Yayoi periods, and included the LT (length of thorax), LE (length of elytra) and LB (length of body).

We then analysed these measurements to determine the presence of any differences in body size between the various regions and time periods represented by these sites.

We could not distinguish immature individuals from mature ones based on the impressions only, as there are insufficient diagnostic characteristics for immature beetles.

Some of the smaller impression samples might therefore be of immature beetles.

For comparisons of the elytra and thorax lengths of maize weevil impressions and fossils from different sites for Figs. 2 and 8, we used the D'Agostino and Pearson K2 normality test and then employed one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test.

All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism version 7.00 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA).

For the analysis of the data in Fig. 8, data from each site were first pooled into groups corresponding to Zones A, B, C and E depending on the site location; data from zone C were excluded from the statistical analysis because of the small number of samples available from this zone.

PARAGRAPH

In order to investigate the cause of the result, we referred to experimental results and the literature on the mechanism of body enlargement of the current weevils, and picked out the potential plant foods that have been infested by weevils from archaeological materials in this region.

And we considered a propagation process of the maize weevils based on the characteristics of spatiotemporal distribution of the infested plant foods.

Reconstruction of the number of maize weevils in vessels from the Tatesaki site

PARAGRAPH

By examining pottery remains with the naked eye, we identified 11 vessels with exposed impressions of maize weevils.

One of these vessels (TSK 285) dates to the end of the Early Jomon period, while another (TSK 3014) dates to the beginning of the Middle Jomon period.

The other vessels (TSK 0016, 0484, 4001, 4002, 4004, 4006, 4007, 4008 and 4009) all belong to the first half of the Late Jomon period (Yoshida et al., 2001).

Next, to find unexposed impressions, all samples except for vessel TSK 3014 were examined using soft X-ray and X-ray CT.

PARAGRAPH

Vessel TSK 484 contained 85 exposed maize weevil impressions (Fig. 4).

X-ray CT scans further revealed and enabled the rendering of 3-D images of 332 unexposed impressions from sectional images, with six of these also being rendered as soft X-ray silhouettes (Fig. 5).

These unexposed impressions from vessel TSK 484 all revealed the same external morphological features as the maize weevil impressions from the five unrestored potsherds.

A total of 417 maize weevils were therefore included in the vessel remains of TSK 484, and a 3-D imaging plot of their locations showed the relatively even distribution of these impressions throughout the vessel (Fig. 5).

PARAGRAPH

The inner surface of vessel TSK 285 had an exposed maize weevil impression in addition to 12 exposed impressions of Echinochloa sp. seeds.

Further, unexposed impressions included five seeds of Echinochloa sp., one unknown seed, and two maize weevils (Fig. 6).

Although eight other vessels with exposed maize weevil impressions from the Tatesaki site were also examined with soft X-ray imaging, no further unexposed impressions were discovered.

PARAGRAPH

Based on impression density, the ten vessels found with weevil impressions could be divided into two categories: under 1/100 cm2 (‘type A') and over 10/100 cm2 (‘type B’) (Fig. 7).

The data indicated that most (8/10) vessels were type A vessels and contained several species of plant seeds in addition to the weevils as exemplified by vessel TSK 285.

The small number of maize weevils and the large variety of seeds observed in the type A vessels suggest the accidental rather than deliberate introduction of maize weevils into the clay.

However, this cannot be as easily concluded for the type B vessels.

The two examples of type B vessels, TSK 484 and TSK 0016, exhibited a high density and homogenous distribution of maize weevils.

It is unknown whether the cause of this phenomenon was accidental or deliberate.

The extensive remains of TSK 484 (3369 cm2) clearly showed a significant increase in the total number of observed impressions (417) compared to other vessels from the Tatesaki site as well as a larger total number of weevils (501) calculated from the 3-D reconstruction of this vessel (Table 2).

At least it is a fact that there were a lot of maize weevils around the maker of this vessel.

SECTION

Morphological comparison of maize weevils from the Tatesaki site

PARAGRAPH

The sizes of the maize weevil impressions from the Tatesaki site were compared to those from the other Jomon sites (Fig. 8; Table 4).

Sites running south to north were divided into five zones (A–E) based on their annual mean isotherms (Fig. 8a) (Harada, 1971).

The average lengths of the body (LB), thorax (LT), and elytra (LE) of maize weevil impressions from sites with more than three samples were compared using the Tukey-Kramer method (Fig. 8b).

The maize weevils from the Tatesaki site and Sannai-Maruyama sites in zone E were significantly larger than those from the other sites in zones A and B in terms of overall body length, elytra length, and thorax length (p value range of 0.0011 to <0.0001).

PARAGRAPH

The body sizes of weevils in zone E were larger than those of the other zones.

The average length of weevils from the two sites in zone E (the Sannai-Maruyama site in the Tohoku region and the Tatesaki site in the Hokkaido region) was 3.91 mm.

On the other hand, the average body size in zone B was 3.47 mm, while the average body size in zone A was 3.42 mm (Fig. 8b, Table 4).

This suggests that weevils in the northern regions were larger than those in the southern regions.

Although there are few samples in this middle zone between zone A and B, weevils from the two sites (Fig. 3; 3, 4) of the Hokuriku and Ohinoki site (Figs. 3; 5) in zone C are large in length (LE < 4.05 mm) like the ones from zone E (see Table 3).

The size differences were therefore clearly observed between western and eastern Japan.

No maize weevil impressions or fossils were found at sites in zone D.

SECTION

Discussion

SECTION

Cause of body size differences between regions

PARAGRAPH

Previous experiments on modern maize weevils fed with unpolished rice have shown that weevils exposed to lower air temperatures and higher humidity grew larger (Harada, 1971; Kinoshita and Ishikura, 1940).

This suggests that differences in air temperature found across Japan may influence their growth and development as these beetles are widely distributed from Japan's southern to northern regions.

However, Kinoshita and Ishikura (Kinoshita and Ishikura, 1940) reported that differences in food resources exert a stronger effect on the body size of maize weevils than air temperature: males fed rice at 25 °C had LT and LE values of 1.03 and 1.05 times compared to those of males fed at a temperature of 30 °C, respectively, while males fed on sweet potatoes had LT and LE values of 1.12 and 1.13 times to those of their counterparts fed on rice, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

Weevil remains from two sites (Tatesaki and Motonobaru) that exhibit different present-day annual mean temperatures (approximately 6.3 °C difference in 2015 (Home page of the Japanese Meteorological Agency, 2016)), show that weevils from the Tatesaki site, which is located in a cooler region (zone E), were 12.7% larger in the length of the thorax (LB) than those from the warmer Motonobaru site (zone B).

In addition, the mean LE and LT values of the Tatesaki weevils were 9.1% and 11.1% larger, respectively, than those recorded for the Motonobaru site.

Our data therefore show that maize weevils living in the cooler regions of zone E were overall 1.13 times larger in LB than those living in the warmer regions.

PARAGRAPH

Another study has shown that the maize weevils during the Jomon period were 1.25–1.3 times larger than their modern counterparts fed with rice (Obata et al., 2011).

Additionally, a feeding experiment using non-cereal plants revealed the high adaptability of these beetles to acorns and chestnuts as a food source (Delobel and Grenier, 1993).

Weevils fed on these nuts attained larger weights and had a higher number of symbiotes.

PARAGRAPH

In addition to the results of these previous studies, our data suggest that the size of maize weevils in prehistoric Japan was mainly affected by differences in their main food resource, rather than by differences in annual mean temperature (Kinoshita and Ishikura, 1940; Delobel and Grenier, 1993).

PARAGRAPH

Of course, we know well that we must consider not only the natural factors but also the difference in shrinkage ratio of pottery and impression due to differences in the process of making pottery.

However, the tendency that the difference in sizes between western Japan and eastern Japan largely exceeds the difference between the phases and regions indicates that this was not due to the pottery making process.

SECTION

Chestnuts and acorns in the Jomon period

PARAGRAPH

The remains of chestnuts during the Jomon period indicate a distribution range that was lightly dependant on climatic conditions, and that the main habitat for this nut encompassed eastern Japan (Ishida et al., 2016).

The area in which chestnuts were utilised during the Jomon period has been defined as the ‘Cultural Area of Utilisation of Chestnut and Japanese Lacquer’ (Sasaki, 2014).

This area included the eastern half of Honshu and half of southern Hokkaido during the latter half of the Initial Jomon to the Early Jomon periods.

In western Japan on the other hand, acorns of the red bark oak tree (Quercus gilva) were mainly utilised, and this region has been referred to as the ‘Cultural Area of Utilisation of the red bark oak’ (Sasaki, 2014).

PARAGRAPH

The key point however, is that the distribution area of larger-sized maize weevils corresponds both geographically and temporally with Sasaki's ‘Cultural Area of Utilisation of Chestnut and Japanese Lacquer’ (Sasaki, 2014).

The larger size of the weevils in this area was likely not the result of lower air temperatures, but rather a result of the presence of chestnuts as a food source with their higher volume and nutritional content (chestnuts have much higher levels of soluble glucides and a better balance in amino acid composition than e.g., maize and wheat) (Delobel and Grenier, 1993).

PARAGRAPH

This phenomenon—where a population of weevils fed on chestnuts are larger in size than a population fed on acorns—can be explained by the entomological principle of ‘Host Race Formation’ (Diehl and Bush, 1984).

This concept argues that a host race (a partially reproductively isolated population on a new host) is not a distinct species but a population with different morphological and ecological characteristics developed as a result of adaptations to the new host.

Such changes are seen, for example, in specific plant-eating insects, and it is thought that such specialisation can lead to the evolution of new species.

Since we have not found any species-level characteristics that differentiate the two differently sized populations of maize weevils present in the Jomon period, we argue that the morphological differences observed between the beetles of eastern and western Japan during this period mainly reflect the use of chestnuts as a staple by people in the eastern regions.

SECTION

Distribution and diffusion of chestnuts in prehistoric Hokkaido

PARAGRAPH

Although plant remains from archaeological sites belonging to the Initial Jomon period in Hokkaido include Japanese walnut, water oak, amur cork tree and wild vine, chestnuts have not been discovered for this period (Table 5) (Yamada and Shibauchi, 1997).

Yamada and Shibauchi (Yamada and Shibauchi, 1997) stress that the chestnut was not native to Hokkaido originally; rather, the first appearance of chestnut nuts in archaeological records was confirmed in sites facing the Tsugaru Strait dated to the end of the Early Jomon period.

Chestnut nuts were first present in Hokkaido itself from the Middle Jomon period, based on excavations of many sites belonging to this period.

Chestnuts excavated from sites in the Ishikari Lowland, which is the northern limit of the current natural distribution of chestnut trees, were shown to date to the Late Jomon period.

DNA analyses further corroborated that modern chestnut trees in southern Hokkaido originated from the Tohoku region in north-eastern Japan (Suzuki, 2016).

PARAGRAPH

The study by Yamada and Shibauchi (Yamada and Shibauchi, 1997) remains validated by the latest data (mainly from (Sasaki, 2014)) from botanical remains at sites in Hokkaido (Fig. 9).

These data confirm the lack of chestnut utilisation in the Initial to the first half of the Early Jomon period in Hokkaido.

Instead, chestnuts were brought to northern sites facing the Tsugaru Strait from the Aomori Prefecture on the other side of the Strait in the latter half of the Early Jomon period.

The chestnuts were likely distributed by people sharing the same ‘Ento-doki’ culture, because of the usefulness of this tree as a food resource and as a structural material (Yamada and Shibauchi, 1997).

These people managed and cultivated chestnuts at these respective sites, gradually expanding the distribution range further north.

The same hypothesis of chestnut distribution was proposed by M. Suzuki in 2016 (Suzuki, 2016).

He wrote a history of the utilisation of the chestnut tree in the Jomon period and expressed this phenomenon as ‘the chestnut that crossed the sea'.

SECTION

Link between the distributions of chestnuts and maize weevil remains

PARAGRAPH

As discussed above, for the first two-thirds of the Early Jomon period there is no evidence of the presence of chestnut trees in Hokkaido, either as a food source or as a construction material.

However, during this time the Jomon people were performing early forest management and intensive utilisation of the chestnut in the Aomori region to the south as demonstrated by botanical remains (Noshiro and Suzuki, 2006).

Fig. 10 shows the changing distribution of the nuts and pollen of the chestnut and other useful plants at the Sannai-Maruyama site where this phenomenon of intensive chestnut utilisation is well recognised.

The parallel timing of the occurrence of maize weevil and chestnut remains at this site compares with that observed at the Tatesaki site.

Indeed, the appearance of maize weevils in southern Hokkaido in the late phase of the Early Jomon period as suggested by the ‘Typed lower cylindrical’ vessel (TSK 285), corresponds well with the timing of the expanded distribution of chestnuts and pollen into this region.

PARAGRAPH

Based on the abundant remains of pollen from chestnut trees found at the Sannai-Maruyama site, researchers have inferred the presence of a huge forest of chestnut trees in and around this settlement in the Jomon period (Yoshikawa, 2011).

Additionally, Noshiro and Suzuki (Noshiro and Suzuki, 2006), who studied wooden artefacts and natural woods recovered from six sites around the Aomori Plain (including the Sannai-Maruyama site), concluded that in the Early Jomon around and especially within the Sannai-Maruyama site, chestnut and Thujopsis dolabrata trees were strongly preferred for cultivation, and chestnut trees were also mainly utilised from the Middle Jomon to the Late Jomon.

The people living in and around the Sannai-Maruyama site also exhibited a preference for planting Rhus verniciflua and Paulownia tomentosa, both species from China.

Overall, there is conclusive evidence of the intensive management of the forest around this settlement (Noshiro and Suzuki, 2006).

This contrasts with the dominance of natural spices in the surrounding forest.

Although the number of charred chestnuts collected from the Tatesaki site is small, analysis shows that the pollen of chestnut trees was dominant throughout the entirety of human occupation at this site; indeed, the abundance of pollen strongly suggests the presence of a very large forest of chestnut trees in this area (Yamada, 2015).

The two oldest maize weevil impressions at this site belong to the end of the Early Jomon and the early part of the Middle Jomon when chestnut pollen was especially dominant (Mori, 2017).

It is therefore possible that maize weevils at the Tatesaki site infested stored chestnuts.

Although the proportion of chestnut pollen decreased slightly in the Late Jomon when the number of maize weevil impressions increased, the proportion of chestnut pollen remained the highest among the woody plants.

Paleobotanical and archaeological data in the region also suggest that the Late Jomon was a period of peak utilisation of chestnuts (Yamada and Shibauchi, 1997).

The utilisation of chestnuts in particular, and nuts in general, in the Early Jomon through the Late Jomon in this region is controversial (Crawford, 2011).

However, nut remains and the charred wood of chestnuts appear in archaeological records at least by the end of the Early Jomon (Suzuki, 2016).

Although the discovery of the maize weevil at the Tatesaki site is based on indirect evidence (impressions rather than fossils), it provides strong support to the hypothesis that chestnut utilisation in this region flourished during the end of the Early Jomon and the beginning of the Late Jomon.

Transported weevils or native weevils?

PARAGRAPH

The diffusion of maize weevils into colder areas and onto islands in prehistoric Japan appears to have been caused mainly by human activity via the transport and trade of foods containing nuts (Obata, 2016a; Obata, 2016b).

This hypothesis would be refuted if both the nuts and beetles were shown to be domestic species in this area at this time.

However, chestnut in prehistoric Hokkaido was not domestic and was introduced from the northern Tohoku region.

On the contrary, examples of older weevils than the Tatesaki site have not been discovered from the archaeological sites yet, and the materials of the geological age have not been also unknown in this region.

Therefore we have two hypotheses on the origin of maize weevils from the Tatesaki site.

One is that the weevils were domestic ones which had inhabited in the forests around the archaeological sites in south Hokkaido and adapted to stored chestnuts along with the establishment of storage facilities of chestnut in the Tatesaki site.

The other is that maize weevils discovered at the Tatesaki site were distributed there unknowingly through the transport of infested chestnut nuts over the Tsugaru Strait by the Ento-doki people living in the Tohoku region.

The larger body size of maize weevils found in Hokkaido and the simultaneous presence of chestnuts and maize weevils in archaeological records in this region could strongly suggest the latter hypothesis.

However, it is a conjecture at the present stage without sufficient evidence.

Future verification is desired.

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

We found vessels with maize weevil impressions dating from the Early Jomon period to the Late Jomon period at the Tatesaki site in Hokkaido.

These maize weevils are the first such discovery in Hokkaido.

Based on comparisons with other remains of weevils and chestnuts across Japan, we concluded that the difference in size of the maize weevils at this site reflects the utilisation of the chestnut as their main food source.

We also concluded that the maize weevils that inhabited the area around the Tsugaru Strait in the Jomon period infested chestnuts.

Although origin of the maize weevils in the southern Hokkaido is not clear, chestnuts were transported by humans into southern Hokkaido from the northern Tohoku region.

The data indicate the presence of storage facilities for cultivated chestnuts in this region as maize weevils would not otherwise have flourished in the cooler climate of Tohoku.

Additionally, although there was little botani-archaeilogical evidence directly indicating high utilisation of chestnuts from the layer of the Late Jomon in the Tatesaki site, the huge number of the maize weevils in the vessel TSK 484 and a lot of vessels with maize weevil impression belonging to the Late Jomon were simultaneous with the period of flourishment of chestnuts cultivation in the southern Hokkaido.

PARAGRAPH

Therefore we can conclude that the maize weevil impressions from the Tatesaki site is one of good examples indicating strong relationship between beginning and prosperity of plant cultivation and invasion and colonization of stored food pest insects even in the Prehistoric Japan.

Further investigations and discoveries of maize weevils in the Jomon period would make us draw a more detail picture of history of establishing relationships between human, cultivated plants, and pest insects.
