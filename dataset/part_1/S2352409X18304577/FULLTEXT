TITLE

The evolution of obsidian procurement in ancient Oaxaca, Mexico: New data from the Sistema 7 Venado architectural complex, Monte Albán

SECTION

Introduction: archaeological background

PARAGRAPH

The prehispanic ceremonial centre of Monte Albán is located southwest of Oaxaca de Juárez (Coordinates UTM 14Q 737561.00 m E 1885655.00 m N), capital of the Mexican State of Oaxaca, and was constructed on the southern part of a natural hilltop at around 1550 m above sea level, overlooking the valley of Oaxaca.

The site includes several types of religious and political stone buildings, ceremonial platforms, places and funeral complexes, covering a large area of about 500 ha.

For eight excavation campaigns (2009–2016), the Franco-Mexican archaeological program, “Proyecto arqueológico Sistema 7 Venado”1 (P7V-MA), has been exploring the south part of the hill, known as 7 Venado System, according to the first denomination of Alfonso Caso in the 1930s (Caso, 1928; Caso, 1965; Fig. 1).

PARAGRAPH

The Sistema 7 Venado (hereafter S7V) is a 3 hectare site situated at a height of around 1890 m above sea level, approximately 30 m below the level of the Monte Albán main place.

This architectural complex consists of nine large courts and fifteen monumental buildings, articulated by four broad staircases.

Prior to the start of the research, this complex was considered to be a late settlement, related to the Mixtec Period (1200–1521 CE), first described by Caso (2002: 245) and especially by Blanton et al. (1982: 6), corresponding to the Period V of Duverger's chronology (Duverger, 1999: 119).2

The oldest dating evidence was published in the 1970s, proving that S7V was already occupied around 500 BCE (Winter, 1972).

Since 2009, forty-six 14C dating revealed that the S7V represents one of the first occupations of Monte Albán hill, which probably began around 800 BCE (Duverger et al., 2017: 732; see comparative chronology on Fig. 2), corresponding to the end of the San José Phase (Lyon-10,981, Test-pit 36 Carbon 2370 ± 35 BP: 728–385 BCE; C2RMF-1A774, Test-pit 43, Carbon 2495 ± 30 BP: 783–517 BCE; Richardin, 2014).

Excavations also led to the recovery of ancient monumental architecture (Test-pits 38–48 in Plaza C, campaigns 2012–2013) and Olmec ceramic types, already identified in others valley sites of Oaxaca (San José Mogote, Guadalupe, Rosario).

Then, by around 250–300 CE, the S7V was ritually abandoned and its monuments was covered by soil, offering a good protection to the archaeological contexts (C2RMF-1A769, Test-pit 48, Carbon 1715 ± 30 BP: 249–394 CE; C2RMF-1A775, Test-pit 44, Carbon 1765 ± 30 BP: 209–354 CE; Duverger, 2015: 208–217).

The abandonment appears to correspond approximately with the beginning of Monte Albán IIIA phase, and could represent a transition period to the development of classical Monte Albán site, that supposed to be the regional “capital of the Zapotec world” (Blanton, 1978; Caso et al., 1967; Saville, 1899; Winter, 1989).

PARAGRAPH

The principal aim of the P7V-MA project was to understand space organization and building articulations, focusing on the archaeological exploration of courts and open spaces.

The excavations revealed that the S7V courts were not only circulation places, but also a true architectural and symbolic space arrangement, characterised by building designs, complex stone delimitations, tombs, burials and different kinds of offerings.

This space arrangement has been modified several times during a thousand years of occupation.

PARAGRAPH

The study of the archaeological remains included various investigations focusing on the geographic origins of artefacts materials, particularly concerning lithic and ceramic production.

As part of the Jaltepetongo sedimentary rocks formation, the hill of Monte Albán was extensively used for stones extraction, such as sandstone, arkose and limestone, for the construction of the whole ceremonial centre, as a local and economical source of supplies (Duverger et al., 2017).

However, various types of smaller lithic objects or tools appeared to be totally exogenous.

It concerns, in this case, obsidians artefacts, which were found in large quantities in many archaeological contexts of S7V.

As shown by Pires-Ferreira (1975), Elam (1993) Elam et al. (1994) and more recently Feinman et al. (2018), obsidian was one of the principal prehispanic material importations in the central valleys of Oaxaca, and was subject of intense long distance trades.

Whatever their origin, all the objects found in S7V are prismatic blades, tools or weapons developed on blades (see Figs. 3a, b and c, 4a and b, 5a and b, 6a and b).

No block, nucleus or rejuvenation tablets of nucleus were discovered.

The only typological peculiarity of this corpus is a small scraper on flake chipped on black obsidian from Altotonga source, in Veracruz (see Fig. 7a and b).

The results presented below are based on the analysis of 416 obsidian artefacts, collected in secured stratigraphic contexts (Table A).3

SECTION

Experimental: PIXE analysis of archaeological samples

PARAGRAPH

At the end of the fieldwork season 2011, the INAH gave the project team permission to temporarily export nine obsidian tools and flakes to be analysed by PIXE (standing for Particle Induced X-ray Emission) at the C2RMF laboratory (standing for Centre de Recherche et de Restauration des Musées de France; Palais du Louvre, Paris).

By comparison with the results of other regional research in Mexico (Argote-Espino et al., 2012; Calligaro et al., 2005; Charlton and Spence, 1982; Cobean, 2002; Cobean et al., 1991; Glascock et al., 2010; Tenorio et al., 1998; Zeitlin and Heimbuch, 1978), these preliminary results confirmed that these obsidians came from four different sources.

In 2012, a second temporary export permit was provided for analysis of another 141 samples; this was followed by 98 samples in 2013, 161 samples in 2014 and 7 in 2015.

Therefore, in total, 416 tools, flakes and weapons have been analysed; some are drawn and studied using 3D microscopy.

PARAGRAPH

PIXE analysis was carried out with the external beam of the AGLAE accelerator at the C2RMF (Dran et al., 2004).

Whilst this analytical technique bears similarities with X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), it has four major advantages in archaeological artefacts analysing (Dran et al., 2000):

it is non-invasive (direct analysis of artefacts without sampling)

and non-destructive (analysed area is not altered)

it has high accuracy (the chemical composition is obtained within 1%)

and high sensitivity (measurement of trace elements useful for provenance down to a few parts per million or ppm).

PARAGRAPH

The artefacts were subjected to a 3 MeV proton beam of 1 nA intensity for a few minutes allowing the chemical composition of the samples made of obsidian to be derived from two PIXE spectra.

The first spectrum was devoted to the measurement of major elements (from sodium to iron, 10 ≤ Z ≤ 26); it was recorded in a helium atmosphere allowing the measurement of sodium, magnesium, aluminium, and silicon.

The second spectrum was devoted to the measurement of trace elements.

It was recorded with four detectors screened with a 50-μm aluminium absorber to attenuate the X-ray of major constituents.

The analysis was recorded by scanning the 50 μm beam on a 1 × 1 mm2 area, in order to account for possible heterogeneities due to inclusions or dust grains at the surface.

The major element concentrations included iron, which was determined from the first spectrum.

The matrix composition determined in this step was used in the processing of the second spectrum by adjusting trace elements concentrations to the take into account the level of iron determined in the first spectrum.

PARAGRAPH

The quantitative processing was achieved using the TRAUPIXE program (Pichon et al., 2015) developed at the C2RMF on the basis of GUPIXWIN software (Campbell et al., 2010).

All in all, the measured elements comprised: Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nd, Ba and Pb.

Prior to analysis of archaeological artefacts, the full processing chain was carefully checked on pellets of reference geochemical targets (DR-N from Centre de Recherche Pétrographique et Géochimique CRPG, SRM 278 obsidian samples from the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST).

SECTION

Sourcing of obsidian artefacts from the Sistema 7 Venado

PARAGRAPH

The results of the analysis of the 416 obsidian artefacts from the S7V are reported in Tables B to L (see Appendices).

In these tables, PIXE sourcing results are correlated with the results of 14C dating and/or relative chronologies in order to understand the sequence of importation since the middle of the Mesoamerican Period I (900–500 BCE) or San José-Guadalupe-Rosario Phases4 in the Oaxaca valley to the beginning of Mesoamerican Period III (200–400 CE) or the Monte Albán IIIA Phase (250–650 CE).

SECTION

Obsidian sourcing Tables I to X: results

PARAGRAPH

The main results of this analyse program are the identification of twelve obsidian sources (see Fig. 8 below and tables in Appendices).

Among these, those of Hidalgo and Puebla States (Pachuca, Zacualtipán-Metzquititlán, Malpaís, Paredón and Zaragoza) appear to represent the main suppliers (83%), followed by Veracruz (6%; Pico de Orizaba and Altotonga), Michoacán (4%; Ucareo), Mexico (3%; Otumba and Pacheco) and of Jalisco States (2%; Magdalena).

SECTION

Crossing PIXE sourcing results with the occupation chronology

PARAGRAPH

The number and percentage of artefacts coming from each Mexican obsidian source and for each archaeological phase identified in the S7V is presented in Table M.

These results are similar to those of Blomster and Glascock (2011) and Feinman et al. (2018), which concerns the valley of Oaxaca in general, but provide more detailed information on the specific occupation of the Monte Albán hill, both spatially and temporally.

SECTION

From Rosario to Monte Albán Ia phase

PARAGRAPH

Radiocarbon dating and the typology of ceramics recovered during fieldwork suggest that human activity at the site may extend back to the Rosario (700–500 BCE) and Monte Albán Ia (500–300 BCE) phases.

However, these sealed levels contain sparse amounts of obsidian, as only two blades were discovered.

One is from the Pachuca source area (Rosario phase) whilst the other is from Paredón (attributed to the Monte Albán Ia phase).

Unfortunately, these two tools arising from Central Plateau obsidian sources are numerically insufficient to be representative of obsidian importation, but they integrate in a homogeneous way the statistic already established in other Oaxaca sites.

The rarity of the material at these oldest levels may be the consequence of architectural rearrangements, where spaces were possibly cleaned up before works.

SECTION

From Monte Albán Ic to Monte Albán II phase

PARAGRAPH

The most ancient archaeological levels with a significant density of obsidian lithic material correspond to the Monte Albán Ic phase (300–150/100 BCE).

In total, we collected twelve artefacts from four sources: Pachuca (80%), Paredón, Otumba and Altotonga (each 6%).

PARAGRAPH

During the Monte Albán II phase, it appears that the Central Plateau remains the principal supply region, but the material is increasing in amount and diversity.

The Pachuca source (51%) always provides the majority of the obsidian, but Zaragoza becomes an important source area (25%).

The importation extend to other sources, in small quantities (6 to 1%), including that of the Magdalena (2%) obsidian outcrop around the Tequila Volcano in Jalisco State (Trombold et al., 1993).

PARAGRAPH

Due to disturbed context levels in Tests-pits 26–66, 38–68 and 44–64, it was very difficult to determine an exact limit between lithic artefacts from Monte Albán Ic and Monte Albán II (150/100 BCE–200 CE), and those of Monte Albán II from those of Monte Albán IIIA (150/100 BCE–200 CE–500 CE).

To provide the most precise analysis, the obsidians from these levels are presented separately.

In the MA Ic/MA II, we can notice that the source deposit of Pachuca (81%) is dominant with subsidiary amounts from other suppliers: Zaragoza (7%), Guadalupe Victoria (2%) and Ucareo (7%).

In the MA II/MA IIIA, we observe a similar diversification of sources supply, but the results are slightly different.

In these levels, the Pachuca source (64%) remains the main source with secondary materials provided by the areas of Ucareo (9%) and Zaragoza (7%) as to a lesser extent Paredón (4%), Altotonga (4%), Otumba (3%), Zacualtipan (3%), Guadalupe Victoria (2%), Magdalena (3%), and a new one, Pacheco (2%) an obsidian subsource localized in the Otumba volcanic complex (Argote-Espino et al., 2012: 52).

SECTION

Monte Albán IIIA phase

PARAGRAPH

The beginning of phase Monte Albán IIIA corresponds to the period of abandonment of the S7V, but during this period, the diversity and quantity of obsidian introduced is the greatest.

Of 207 objects associated with this phase, 55% came from Pachuca and 22% from Zaragoza sources; 49 others artefacts arise from nine others sources, including Malpaís, Hidalgo.

These sourcing analyses also reveal detailed information for the Monte Albán IIIA phase.

All blades (MA-Ob46, 47, 48, 167, 168, 169, 171 and 173) discovered in Test-pits 30–40 at the base of the Edificio 8, in an offering context containing large quantities of ceramics, are exclusively from the Zaragoza source area in Puebla State (Gendron, 2013).

SECTION

Regional provenances synthesis

PARAGRAPH

By dividing the artefacts by age and regional provenance, it seems that the Central Plateau was the main region of obsidian supply at the S7V, since the Monte Albán Ic phase, albeit these trade relations involved a group of different sources and were never exclusive.

We note that the obsidian source geographically close to Monte Albán (Pico de Orizaba) was not the most important provider.

These results corroborate overall those of Pires-Ferreira (1976) who analysed 500 obsidians arising from levels of Early and Middle Formative periods (before 300 BCE), and those of Feinman et al. (2018), even though they are different in some details.

Indeed, it turns out that the material of the Pachuca source has always been dominant until the abandonment of the site, likewise the Zaragoza source, whose importation increasing is already visible during Monte Albán II phase, before 300 CE.

Moreover, the Guadalupe Victoria source, which is described by Pires-Ferreira (1976) and Feinman et al. (2018: 19) just as important during the Late Formative phase (300 BCE–300 CE), appears to be a minor part of the corpus discovered.

PARAGRAPH

During Monte Albán II and IIIA phases, we can observe a sensible diversification of artefacts origins, as it happened at the same time in the central valleys of Oaxaca.

The sources are the same: the Hidalgo-Puebla States sources of Pachuca, Paredón, Zaragoza, Zacualtipan and Guadalupe Victoria.

Various minor provenances are also present, like Pico de Orizaba (Veracruz), Magdalena (Jalisco), and Ucacero (Michoacán), already identified by Pires-Ferreira for the Early Formative period.

This situation corresponds approximately with the period of abandonment of S7V, between 250 and 300 CE.

Quite the contrary, the archaeological contexts of S7V proved that obsidian importation from Central Plateau in Monte Albán hill is already underway during Rosario and Monte Albán Ia phases.

PARAGRAPH

It is also remarkable that, despite the analysis of 416 artefacts, covering a millennium of activity in S7V, we did not found obsidian coming from the Maya area, such as El Chayal or San Martín Jilotepeque, as those documented in Tierras Largas and San José Mogote (Blomster and Glascock, 2011, Table 3; Feinman et al., 2018: 18).

SECTION

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

The sourcing by PIXE technique of 416 obsidian artefacts excavated from test-pits during height archaeological field campaigns in the S7V permits to reintroduce this ceremonial centre in the prehispanic commercial networks of central valleys of Oaxaca, and by extension, in the cultural context of Mesoamerican Periods I and II (1200 to 500 BCE, and 500 BCE to 200 CE).

It gives us more details about its well-developed and structured trade system, and the diversity of sources supply, and revealed a constant and intense connection with the Central Mexican Plateau, from the Rosario phase, as it has been mentioned by Pires-Ferreira (1976).

The commonest sources are Pachuca (Hidalgo) and Zaragoza (Puebla), which constantly supplied Monte Albán, until the abandonment of the main site, around 700 CE.

PARAGRAPH

We note that all obsidians collected in the S7V are already manufactured (tools or projectile points).

No block, nucleus or nucleus pieces have been discovered.

This absence of obsidian nodule cores corroborates the observations already made in the Oaxaca valley (Elam, 1993; Flannery and Marcus, 2005: 186–187), but is still difficult to explain.

Indeed, at the same time, quantities of quartzite, chalcedony or flint flakes were discovered in S7V test-pits, and prove that peoples of Oaxaca possessed the mastery of lithic percussion techniques.

Therefore, it could be interpreted as a commercial or political strategy to import material from selected sources, or a technical choice to obtain a better obsidian quality.

PARAGRAPH

Besides, these analyses, combined with our 14C dating, lead us to re-examine the early development of Monte Albán in relation to the regional social model developed since 1970s (Blanton, 1978; Blanton et al., 1979: 377; Blanton et al., 1999: 48–67; Winter, 1974).

The construction of S7V is coherent with this model overall, and may correspond to the first significant occupation period of the whole Monte Albán hill (500–100 BCE).

But, in details, the presence of monumental architectural structures and obsidian material in the most ancient levels indicates that this place was clearly occupied before 500 BCE, perhaps in a ceremonial way, and was already involved in the obsidian trade activities.

Undoubtedly, we have a lot to learn from the very local history of this southern part of Monte Albán, which must be taken into account in the general history of the hill and the valley of Oaxaca.
