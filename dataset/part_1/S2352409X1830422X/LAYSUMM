TITLE

Post-Linear Pottery cultural boundary and repopulation of the German Rhineland: Revisiting the Western contacts hypothesis

PARAGRAPH

The lack of consensus surrounding the macroscopic determination of high-quality black flint discovered at the Aldenhoven Plateau sites (Rhineland, North-Western Germany), from the beginning of the Middle Neolithic, has far-reaching consequences for the anthropological understanding of the socio-cultural dynamics involved in the neolithization of north-western Europe.

Here, we present an integrated study of this flint using geochemical and technological analysis.

Although it must be enriched, it suggests new insights relating to the repopulation of the German Rhineland after the dissolution of the first agro-pastoral communities.

The impact of Belgian populations seems limited and oriented toward its eastern part.
