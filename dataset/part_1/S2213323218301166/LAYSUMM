TITLE

Routine replacement of a vagal nerve stimulator generator leading to asystole

PARAGRAPH

One method for treating certain types of drug-resistant seizures is vagal nerve stimulation (VNS).

VNS requires a generator that must be replaced periodically due the battery expiring.

These generator replacements are typically routine without complications.

We present a case report of a 52-year-old female with a longstanding history of drug-resistant epilepsy that included focal impaired awareness seizures.

She had previously undergone a generator replacement without complication.

Her latest replacement was accompanied by multiple bouts of asystole.

We discuss the case, possible causes of the asystole, and its relevance to the future of VNS generator replacement and epilepsy treatment.
