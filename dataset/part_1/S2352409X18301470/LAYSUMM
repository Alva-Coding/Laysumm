TITLE

Identification and examination of inconspicuous carnivore modifications

PARAGRAPH

Sometimes marks found on the surfaces of long bones from Plio-Pleistocene sites are small, inconspicuous and thus exhibit ambiguous morphology which makes accurate identification, using standard low-magnification methods, difficult and contentious.

I apply high-magnification, scanning electron microscopy to visualize diagnostic features of inconspicuous carnivore marks from long bones that have been fed on exclusively by avian and mammalian carnivores.

Results show these marks exhibit morphology that differentiates them from other inconspicuous marks.

This leads to improved identification accuracy which contributes to their interpretive potential when reconstructing carnivore and hominin interactions with carcasses and predicting early access by hominins.
