TITLE

A case of interictal dysphoric disorder comorbid with interictal psychosis: Part of the same spectrum or separate entities?

PARAGRAPH

Co-occurrence of the trio of epilepsy, depression and psychosis is relatively poorly studied, compared to the pairs of disorders within the three.

Here we report a case of temporal lobe epilepsy with bizarre bodily hallucinations and brief but severe depressive episodes.

Based on the close clinical observation and treatment response of the case, we discuss co-occurrence of the trio of disorders in detail.

In patients with epilepsy, depression and psychosis may be more closely related than is currently thought, and co-occur in a different way than in those without epilepsy.
