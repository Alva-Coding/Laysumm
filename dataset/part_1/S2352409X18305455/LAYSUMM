TITLE

Compositional analysis and fragmentation of Early Central Petén (Guatemala) figurines

PARAGRAPH

Proposals about the intentional breakage and exchange of fragments of anthropomorphic terracotta figurines can be investigated via instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of their chemical composition.

INAA of 93 Preclassic (~1000–400 BCE) fragments from two Maya sites in Petén, Guatemala, identified five compositional groups, and left eight unassigned.

All artifacts but one are thought to have been produced in the lakes region around the two sites, but only five fragments suggest intra- and inter-site circulation.

These findings provide scant support for exchange and ‘enchainment’ of early Maya figurine fragments, as suggested in other parts of the world.
