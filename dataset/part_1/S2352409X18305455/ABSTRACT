ABSTRACT

TITLE

Compositional analysis and fragmentation of Early Central Petén (Guatemala) figurines

PARAGRAPH

Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of the chemical composition of 93 Preclassic fired-clay figurine fragments from two southern lowland Maya sites, Nixtun-Ch'ich' and Ixlú, was the basis for investigating their circulation.

Most artifacts fell into five compositional groups while eight were unassigned.

All artifacts but one are thought to have been produced locally.

Only five analysed fragments suggest circulation or exchange, including three between Nixtun-Ch'ich' and Ixlú and two from different loci within Nixtun-Ch'ich'.

These findings provide little support for the proposition that early Maya figurines were intentionally broken and the fragments exchanged in some sort of ‘enchainment’ activity, as suggested in other parts of the world.
