TITLE

Post-operative nonketotic hyperglycemic induced focal motor status epilepticus related to treatment with corticosteroids following standard anterior temporal lobectomy

PARAGRAPH

This is a case report of a woman with drug resistant focal epilepsy.

She underwent epilepsy surgery and following surgery she was placed on a standard steroid treatment.

After beginning steroids, she developed a new type of seizure that was most likely related to elevated blood sugars from treatment with steroids.

After her blood sugars were controlled these seizures stopped and she has had no more seizures for over 3 years.

Problems following epilepsy surgery are rare.

Aggressive blood sugar control after surgery may reduce potential complications, including seizures related to high blood sugar from treatment with steroids.
