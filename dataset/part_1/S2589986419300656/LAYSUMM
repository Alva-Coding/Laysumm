Persistent extreme delta brush in anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis: Does it portend a poor prognosis?

PARAGRAPH

Several reports have indicated an association between the presence of extreme delta brush (EDB) in the EEG with poor response to immunotherapy and unfavorable outcome in patients with anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis (ANMDARE).

However, the adverse prognostic implication of EBD is less evident in some recent reports.

Here, we report an adolescent girl with ANMDARE, who despite persistence of EDB for nearly 2 years in her serial EEGs, had a speedy and sustained response to immunotherapy.

Our patient restates that, although presence of EDB supports the diagnosis of ANMDARE, its persistence may not reliably predict the response to immunotherapy and prognosis.
