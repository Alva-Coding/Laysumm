TITLE

“The place is full of cabbages”: An analysis of the Irish Late Mesolithic stone tool technology from Kenure, Co. Dublin

PARAGRAPH

This paper describes the Later Mesolithic stone tools collected in the 1940s by the avocational archaeologist Gwendoline Stacpoole from farm fields in the vicinity of Kenure, Co.

Dublin, Ireland.

Made by the last hunter-gatherers in Ireland, these stone tools were produced quickly using locally available raw materials and this collection generally lacks evidence for any specialized stone tool manufacture techniques.

In these respects, the Later Mesolithic stone tools from Kenure are similar to those found elsewhere in Ireland.

In general, the stone tool evidence seems to suggest that Ireland’s last hunter-gatherers occupied relatively stable campsites along coasts and interior waterways.
