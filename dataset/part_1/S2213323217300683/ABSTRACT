ABSTRACT

TITLE

Efficacy of perampanel in a patient with epilepsia partialis continua

PARAGRAPH

Perampanel is the first-in-class selective and noncompetitive α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor antagonist.

It is authorized in the U.S. and Europe as an add-on antiepileptic drug for partial-onset seizures, and for primary generalized tonic–clonic seizures.

Single reports have also indicated a potential efficacy for myoclonic jerks.

Here, we report a patient whose drug-resistant epilepsia partialis continua completely resolved after adding perampanel.

She has remained seizure-free in an eighteen-month follow-up period.

Epilepsia partialis continua reemerged transiently after perampanel was temporarily discontinued, with no recurrence after its reintroduction.

Therefore, this effect was reproducible, and suggests that it might be worth trying perampanel in similar settings.
