TITLE

The Palaepaphos-Laona rampart. A pilot study on earthen architecture and construction technology in Cyprus

PARAGRAPH

In 2016-2017, the Palaepaphos Urban Landscape Project (Cyprus) introduced a pilot study based on geoarchaeological techniques to address issues relating to the extensive use of mudbricks in the construction of a recently discovered monumental rampart.

The impressive defensive monument was a major investment of the fifth-century BCE royal authorities of ancient Paphos.

The paper presents a detailed description of the geoarchaeological analyses conducted on the mudbricks.

The results provide new information on the production of earthen building materials, especially with respect to regional manufacturing practices.

They also highlight environmental choices in relation to raw material selection and usage in the context of the construction of a civic monument.
