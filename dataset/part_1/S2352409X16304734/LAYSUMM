TITLE

Micro-archaeological indicators for identifying ancient cess deposits: An example from Late Bronze Age Megiddo, Israel

PARAGRAPH

This unique assemblage of over 50 items from the Middle Bronze Age in Israel (17th–16th century BCE) includes many items such as pestles, a grinding stone, pounders and smooth worn pebbles that were clearly used for preparing powders.

The assemblage includes some of the raw materials used for the powders, such as a red material composed of clay and an iron oxide, white chalk and black charcoal.

Amazingly the “toolkit” components were found arranged in the way that they had been deliberately packed into a small pit about 3600 years ago.

We do not however know what the colored powders were used for.
