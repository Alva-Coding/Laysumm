TITLE

Super-resolved thermal imagery for high-accuracy facial areas detection and analysis

PARAGRAPH

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have improved perception of the world surrounding us.

This progress is also important for development of medical systems, especially telemedicine solutions that are gaining more attention due to aging societies.

The quality of images is a key factor for remote diagnostics based on computer vision.

In our study we proposed a solution for improving resolution of thermal sequences and showed that in this way accuracy of facial areas detection, used for vital signs estimation, can be increased by 20%.

This important finding can be potentially useful in areas like autonomous driving, remote healthcare, and more.
