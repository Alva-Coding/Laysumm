TITLE

Effects of fermentation on the carbon and nitrogen isotopes of Chinook salmon

PARAGRAPH

Fermentation is a common food preparation technique, particularly in the Arctic and Subarctic.

The complex chemical reactions involved in the fermentation process kill harmful bacteria while preserving beneficial vitamins.

Despite its ubiquity and chemical complexity, archaeologists have not yet considered the potential effects of fermentation within isotopic dietary reconstructions.

This study shows that fermentation produces significant changes in the isotopic values carbon and nitrogen in muscle tissue from central Alaskan salmon.

This finding indicates that archaeologists may be able to identify fermentation via isotopic chemistry and has implications for our understanding of cooking and food storage in the past.
