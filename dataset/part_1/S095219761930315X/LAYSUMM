TITLE

A segmentation-based approach for polyp counting in the wild

PARAGRAPH

During blooming the jellyfish population rapidly increases in a small geographical area, which importantly affects the local ecosystem.

Bloom population dynamics prediction can be established by analyzing population dynamics of polyps, which are one of the forms in the jellyfish life cycle.

This requires counting polyps in underwater images, however manual counting is a time-consuming task as these images might contain over a thousand polyps.

We propose a polyp detection method which automates manual polyp counting.

We show that our method is fast and achieves a high detection

accuracy which leads to an accurate polyp count estimation.
