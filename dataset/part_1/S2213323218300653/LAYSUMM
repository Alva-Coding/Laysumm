TITLE

Improved seizure control and regaining cognitive milestones after vagus nerve stimulation revision surgery in Lennoxâ€“Gastaut syndrome

PARAGRAPH

A boy with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome presented with seizure recurrence, loss of alertness, motor and language skills due to vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) electrode dysfunction.

The electrode dysfunction was not detected during VNS device check-ups.

After electrode replacement and reinitiating VNS, side effects occurred which forced us to switch it off.

Switching off the VNS resulted in immediate seizure recurrence and subsequent status epilepticus.

The status epilepticus could only be halted by reinitiating VNS therapy.

Hereafter, he remained seizure free, is alert, and regained motor and language skills.
