TITLE

Expanding the strontium isoscape for the American midcontinent: Identifying potential places of origin for Cahokian and Pre-Columbian migrants

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Interpretations that employ population movement as a factor in cultural change have a long and uneven history in archaeology from a common use as an explanation of cultural transitions and distribution (via diffusion or migration) in the nineteenth century to their rapid abandonment in the early twentieth century (Adams et al., 1978:525–526).

This decline became especially steep with the ascendancy of processual archaeology and its widespread application of environmental and neoevolutionary models of change (Chapman and Hamerow, 1997).

Only recently has population movement become academically acceptable as an explanative for cultural transitions.

In the United States, for example, consideration of migration has become common in the Southwest (e.g., Clark, 2001:1–2).

Despite this resurgence, the antimigration mantra continues among postmodernists.

For example, Storey and Jones (2011:19) cite Peter Ucko's (1995:12) statement that culture history is “at its most insidious (when coupled with theories of migration) [that have] deprive[d] whole peoples of any legitimate past.”

In this strange twist, recognizing migration, in the eyes of some proponents, becomes potentially demeaning to modern descendants' self-identities (citing Arnold, 2007).

Consequently, for both social and political reasons, interpretive models postulating migration remain underevaluated.

PARAGRAPH

However, the advent of new bioarchaeological techniques allows researchers to bypass such debates with archaeometric measures such as aDNA and stable isotope analyses to identify past human relationships and spatial movement (Bentley, 2006; Orlando et al., 2015).

Numerous studies (see references cited in Section 2) have demonstrated that processual models of ancient monotypic ethnic populations geographically anchored are generally simplistic and that many ancient populations have significant genetic diversity as the result of mingling and interbreeding with surrounding groups, often generated by population movements across a fluid landscape, that is, by migrations.

PARAGRAPH

Population movement is of increasing interest to midcontinental archaeologists as they gain more control over the chronology and material content of regional archaeological assemblages.

Such controls have allowed the identification of possible intrusions of new lifestyles as well as abrupt disjunctures in material culture sequences that might signal population shifts.

In particular, the application of strontium (Sr) isotope ratios as markers to identify individuals as “foreigners” or “locals” has been instrumental in moving archaeologists beyond the limitations of material homology and analogy (e.g., O'Brien, 2010:313–317).

SECTION

Midcontinental strontium and migration

PARAGRAPH

In the last decade, researchers in the American midcontinent have begun employing Sr analysis to investigate prehistoric migration.

An early Sr analysis targeted one of the long-standing questions in native history: the relationship of the twelfth-thirteenth century inhabitants of the southern Wisconsin site of Aztalan (Barrett, 1970) to the large urban center of Cahokia near St. Louis (Fowler, 1997).

The similarity of material culture and lifestyles between Aztalan and Cahokia has generated many theories concerning the relationship between the two sites, ranging from local emulation (analogy) to colonization (homology).

Strontium analysis by Douglas Price et al. (2007) demonstrated that Aztalan's inhabitants included foreigners who may have had important roles in society.

Shortly thereafter, Dana Beehr (2011) conducted Sr analysis on a small number of Illinois and Ohio Hopewell individuals.

While interactions between the two Hopewell centers have been postulated on the basis of stylistic similarities in material culture, evidence for the movement of people was lacking.

Beehr, however, did identify several instances of nonlocal individuals present in each region.

PARAGRAPH

Cook and Price (2015) recently conducted a major Sr study of Fort Ancient populations along the Ohio River valley and its tributaries.

The role of adjacent Mississippian societies in the development of Fort Ancient village farming societies had been earlier postulated (Griffin, 1943, 1967).

Cook and Price showed that some nonlocal individuals were present in early Fort Ancient sites and that they were likely immigrants from surrounding Mississippian societies, perhaps even from Cahokia.

Consequently, their comprehensive study lent credence to earlier views that Mississippian immigrants, though limited in number, may have influenced early Fort Ancient societies.

PARAGRAPH

The present authors undertook a major Sr study (Slater et al., 2014) at the late pre-Columbian center of Cahokia.

Archaeological evidence at Cahokia demonstrates that its cultural interaction extended across the midcontinent between 1050 CE and 1350 (Emerson and Lewis, 1991; Pauketat, 2004; Stoltman, 1991).

The relatively rapid appearance of Cahokia, as well as a dramatic increase in the population at about 1050 CE, indicates that political and social changes occurred quickly, a change that has been referred to by Pauketat (1994) as the “Big Bang.”

Our research, using Sr isotope (87Sr/86Sr) analysis, sought to determine if immigration was a significant factor in population growth at Cahokia (Slater et al., 2014).

PARAGRAPH

In that study (Slater et al., 2014), we (1) established a local 87Sr/86Sr signature for the American Bottom region; (2) assessed 87Sr/86Sr variability among 87 individuals buried in different contexts at Cahokia; and (3) identified people with nonlocal 87Sr/86Sr signatures in their tooth enamel, that is, immigrants.

Our results showed that one-third of people in the Cahokia sample had at least one tooth with a nonlocal 87Sr/86Sr ratio.

Notably, variable mortuary contexts of those individuals indicated they were well integrated in Cahokian society.

PARAGRAPH

An expansion of that Cahokia study by Thompson et al. (2015) used Sr analysis to investigate the possibility of immigrant sacrifice at Cahokia in four different mass-burial features within the famed Mound 72 (Emerson et al., 2016; Fowler et al., 1999).

While 86% of individuals analyzed from Mound 72 (94 of 109 individuals, 185 of 203 teeth) fell within the local 87Sr/86Sr range for the American Bottom, suggesting that the majority of the mass-sacrificial victims may have been local to the Cahokia region, a very tight cluster of Sr ratios in teeth from Feature 229-lower, combined with dental metric and nonmetric evidence, suggests that those individuals were derived from a distinct population, different from most others in Mound 72, and possibly from the region as a whole.

These findings complement mortuary data for Feature 229-lower, which also differs markedly from other mortuary features associated with Mound 72.

PARAGRAPH

Later excavations at the adjacent East St. Louis ceremonial precinct abutting Cahokia to the west yielded an additional mortuary population (Emerson et al., 2018; Nash et al., 2018).

Strontium analysis of 69 individuals indicated that at least 20% of them were not local to the American Bottom (Nash et al., 2018).

PARAGRAPH

Ultimately, the range, variability, and clustering of 87Sr/86Sr ratios for Cahokia's inhabitants from these studies indicate that its citizens were derived from multiple locations within and outside the American Bottom.

It suggests that Cahokia was a polity composed of diverse linguistic, cultural, and political groups and that population movement in pre-Columbian America was a significant factor in fostering native social and cultural diversity (Emerson and Hedman, 2016).

Theoretical constructs — building a strontium isoscape

PARAGRAPH

Having established that the region's population included nonlocal individuals, the challenge was to identify possible places of origin of those immigrants.

Unfortunately, due to our limited information on regional 87Sr/86Sr variability (Hedman et al., 2009), identifying the specific place(s) of origin was not feasible.

In this research, we begin to address that problem by adding to the scope of already available 87Sr/86Sr signatures (e.g., Beehr, 2011; Cook and Price, 2015; Hedman et al., 2009; Price et al., 2007; Slater et al., 2014; Widga et al., 2017) in two ways: (1) we greatly expanded our geographical sample of archaeological and modern faunal teeth along the Mississippi River valley to ascertain regional variability in biologically available strontium isotope ratios (i.e., built an isoscape); and (2) we increased the sample size in our original case study of Cahokian and American Bottom human 87Sr/86Sr ratios to better understand the isotopic variability within the population of Greater Cahokia as a whole.

Our ultimate objective was to determine the extent to which 87Sr/86Sr isotope analysis can be used for identifying the specific place(s) of origin for midcontinental pre-Columbian immigrants with special reference to our Cahokian case study.

PARAGRAPH

J.E. Ericson (1985) first proposed the analysis of strontium isotope ratios in human tissues as a way to address questions of human mobility in prehistory.

Strontium from plants and animals substitutes for calcium in the tissues of consumers, and is deposited in human tooth enamel and bone (Comar et al., 1957).

Because 87Sr/86Sr ratios pass unmodified through the food web, the ratios incorporated into human and animal tissues, termed bioavailable strontium, are determined in part by the geology, geomorphology, and geochemistry of a region, which is reflected in plants they consume.

Because these geological characteristics vary geographically, so should the bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the food web.

Therefore 87Sr/86Sr ratios in human tissues can be used to examine changes in human residence in the past.

PARAGRAPH

Tooth enamel is the preferred material for mobility studies, in part because it is resistant to diagenetic change.

Tooth enamel mineralizes during childhood and unlike bone does not remodel during one's lifetime (Hillson, 1996), therefore, tooth enamel reflects the isotopic composition of diet and place of origin at the time of tooth mineralization.

Differences in strontium isotope ratios between earlier and later developing teeth, or between teeth and bioavailable strontium ratios of the burial location, can be used to infer a change in residence during the life of the individual.

Differences in ratios at the 4th decimal place is considered significant in mobility studies (Price et al., 2012).

PARAGRAPH

Plants contribute most significantly to the Sr signature of consumers, with animal protein and water having less of an impact (Price et al., 2002).

Assuming that people consumed primarily local resources, the 87Sr/86Sr ratios in their tissues should match those of the local plants and animals, while tissues of individuals who lived in and consumed resources from a different geological region (or consumed entirely nonlocal resources) would have a different 87Sr/86Sr signature.

PARAGRAPH

Archaeologists around the world increasingly rely on this method to understand the mobility patterns of prehistoric populations (e.g., Andrushko et al., 2009; Bentley, 2006; Bentley et al., 2004; Eerkens et al., 2014; Ezzo et al., 1997; Ezzo and Price, 2002; Gregoricka, 2013; Hodell et al., 2004; Knudson and Blom, 2009; Knudson and Tung, 2011; Knudson et al., 2004; Price et al., 1994, 2006, 2007; Turner et al., 2009; Wright, 2005).

Notably, the ability to (1) correctly interpret human or fauna 87Sr/86Sr data and (2) test hypothesized mobility patterns are predicated on the construction of a regional baseline isotopic landscape, or isoscape.

Strontium (Sr) has four naturally occurring stable isotopes: 84Sr, 86Sr, 87Sr, and 88Sr.

Only 87Sr, which is formed by the radioactive decay of 87Rb (Rubidium), is radiogenic.

87Rb decays at a constant, albeit very slow, rate over time (the half-life of 87Rb is about 49 billion years).

The ratio of this decay product (87Sr) to the stable 86Sr isotope thus tends to increase with the age and composition of the geologic formation.

Older rocks with high levels of 87Rb tend to exhibit higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios than younger rocks and those with low Rb/Sr ratios (e.g., Capo et al., 1998; Faure, 1986; see references in Bentley, 2006: 175, 178).

PARAGRAPH

In practice, however, while age-based models can help predict strontium signatures in bedrock formations, using them to predict bioavailable strontium signatures in the food web is less straightforward.

Recent studies assessing regional strontium variability (Hedman et al., 2009; Widga et al., 2017) showed that bedrock formations are not reliable indicators for bioavailable strontium.

This is because bioavailable strontium is not just derived from bedrock but is a complex function of differential weathering of deep bedrock geology and overlying surficial geology such as alluvium, glacial till, and loess that are often redeposited.

Other researchers have pointed out that atmospheric particles, such as sea salt, dust, smoke from fires, and sulfate salts from volcanic eruptions, can also affect bioavailable strontium (Burton and Hahn, 2016; Slovak and Paytan, 2011).

Cultural practices, such as the application of fertilizers, can also impact the bioavailable strontium by impacting the isotope geochemistry in soils and groundwater (Bohlke and Horan, 2000).

PARAGRAPH

It is critical that researchers recognize the complexity of natural and human factors that contribute to regional 87Sr/86Sr ratios, and the importance of first establishing a “local” 87Sr/86Sr range for the site or locality being studied, before using 87Sr/86Sr ratios to investigate palaeomobility (Bataille and Bowen, 2012; Brennan et al., 2014; Crowley et al., 2017; Price et al., 2002; Slovak and Paytan, 2011; Slovak et al., 2018).

One commonly used method for determining a local bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr range is to use modern or archaeological fauna as a proxy (Price et al., 2002).

87Sr/86Sr from small animals having limited feeding territories can help control for isotopic variability within a geologic locale by averaging the 87Sr/86Sr signatures from multiple sources of food, and have been successfully used as a proxy for human diet in studies of palaeomobility (Bentley, 2006).

We apply this method here.

Materials and methodology

PARAGRAPH

To build an isoscape for the midcontinent we analyzed the teeth of small nonmigratory mammalian fauna (e.g., squirrel, rabbit, raccoon, etc.) that lived and consumed resources within a very small home range over their short lifetimes (Supplemental Table 1).

Small fauna should provide a reliable indicator of the local bioavailable strontium signature reflecting a variety of ecological niches (Bentley, 2006; Maurer et al., 2012; Price et al., 2002; Slater et al., 2014).

We sampled only tooth enamel, as opposed to bone, because enamel does not continuously remodel during an organism's lifetime and is very resistant to postdepositional alteration (Budd et al., 2000; Lee-Thorp, 2008).

With the exception of five modern samples representing Trempealeau, Wisconsin, we used archaeological samples to avoid problems with samples from modern animals that may have consumed food grown with fertilizers or shipped from other areas, which might have affected their strontium ratios.

We also included published data when available.

PARAGRAPH

The procedure for tooth enamel sample purification followed the protocols established by Ambrose (1993) and Balasse (2002).

Measurements of strontium isotope ratios were carried out at the University of Illinois on a Nu Plasma Multi-Collector-Inductively-Coupled-Plasma-Mass-Spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS, Nu Plasma HR; Nu Instruments, UK).

Methods of sample preparation and analysis on the MC-ICP-MS are presented in detail in Slater et al. (2014) and Thompson et al. (2015).

Blank 88Sr signals were negligible compared to the 88Sr intensities encountered for standards and samples (<0.1%).

Signal intensities were monitored on 83Kr and 85Rb and used to correct for interferences on m/z ratios of 84 (Kr), 86 (Kr), and 87 (Rb).

All 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios were corrected for mass bias fractionation using an internal normalization to 86Sr/88Sr = 0.1194 and further corrected for instrumental offset and drift using the within-batch run values of the NBS 987 standard (accepted value of 0.71025).

Two secondary in-house standards, a South China Sea coral (87Sr/86Sr equivalent to SMOW) and an Eimer & Amend SrCO3 standard, were also routinely run to double-check the instrument's isotopic accuracy and precision of within ±0.00005 from expected.

PARAGRAPH

A sample of 278 small mammals representing 32 regions were used to create a strontium isoscape for the midcontinent (Table 1).

Since our archaeological research focused on identifying Mississippian-era (1050–1350 CE) population movement along the Mississippi River watershed (especially north–south), we sought to establish localized strontium signatures for geographic regions considered important to the Cahokia interaction sphere, including: the American Bottom (the Mississippi River floodplain east of St. Louis, especially around Cahokia); the entire Illinois River valley; the western Great Lakes area (northeast Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota); the lower Ohio River valley (including Indiana); the midwestern prairie/plains (Iowa); the Ozark Mountains in Missouri, Arkansas, and eastern Oklahoma; and the lower Mississippi River (Mississippi and Louisiana) (Figs. 1 and 2).

The goal was to acquire a sample size of at least five 87Sr/86Sr ratios for each region to ensure representation of the range of variability in 87Sr/86Sr for a locality.

Samples might be drawn from multiple sites within a single county or locality in order to characterize the range and variation in strontium ratios for areas of human population (Supplemental Table 2).

Estimates of the “local” strontium range, represented by a mean ± 2 standard deviations, were calculated for seven regions that had sample sizes of 10 or more, while the other 25 regions, with sample sizes of nine or less, were calculated as single-point means (Table 1).

The human tooth enamel represents individuals drawn from 21 different predominately Mississippian-era archaeological locations, including Cahokia, East St. Louis, and other American Bottom sites (Fig. 3).

These sites date to the late 10th through early 14th centuries and encompass the rise and decline of Cahokia as an urban center covering 15–20 km2 and consisting of three linked civic-ceremonial mound precincts: Cahokia, East St. Louis, and St. Louis (Pauketat et al., 2013; Pauketat et al., 2015).

The sample includes a total of 338 individuals, represented by 558 teeth that we sorted into four groups (Table 2).

Group I includes 150 individuals (represented by 269 teeth) from 13 different excavated contexts from Cahokia's Mound 72 (which is within the Cahokia precinct).

Group II is composed of 44 individuals (61 teeth) representing nine different burial contexts within the Cahokia precinct.

Group III includes 73 individuals (118 teeth) from the East St. Louis Mound precinct.

Group IV includes 71 individuals (110 teeth) representing nine archaeological sites (Halliday, Lillie, Olin, Pfeffer, Pittsburgh Lake, Janey B. Goode, Grossmann, Emerald Mound, and Kane Mounds) within the American Bottom region.

These data provide us with a large sample of men, women, and children from diverse mortuary contexts that represent the currently understood isotopic variability of Cahokia's pre-Columbian population (Supplemental Table 3).

Results — midcontinental isoscape

PARAGRAPH

Strontium isotope data from analyses of small mammals for 32 sampled regions in the midcontinent are summarized in Table 1.

Sample size matters when characterizing the Sr range of given region, Sr isotope ratios from a small number of samples, or from a single location, may not represent the true measure of regional variability in bioavailable strontium.

For localities represented by a small number of samples, we present a mean and standard deviation.

A “local” strontium isotope range was calculated for localities having a sample size of 10 or more as the mean ± 2 ∗ standard deviations (SD).

These data are presented as box plots for each region in Fig. 4, and the geographic distribution of mean Sr ratios is depicted in Fig. 2.

Together these data provide a baseline of regional 87Sr/86Sr signatures for the midcontinent.

These figures illustrate an important point to keep in mind when interpreting Sr results, namely, that any single 87Sr/86Sr signature is likely not unique to a single region; similar isotope ratios can occur across several geographic regions.

This means that it will be impossible to distinguish some regions from others using Sr alone.

Consequently, it is possible to underestimate the number of nonlocal individuals at a given site if they originated from a place(s) with a similar isotopic signature; it is also generally impossible to “match” an individual to a given geographic location on the basis of Sr ratios alone.

PARAGRAPH

All 87Sr/86Sr for fauna samples fell between 0.70875 and 0.71768, a spread of 0.00893 (Supplemental Table 2).

The lowest strontium signatures (under 0.71000) were found primarily in along the Mississippi River, from western Illinois just north of the American Bottom, south to Louisiana and the Gulf Coast (see Fig. 2).

Two sites along the Missouri River, one in western Iowa and one in western Missouri, also share this low-end signature.

It is worth noting that the 87Sr/86Sr ratio for seawater (a.k.a. standard mean ocean water or SMOW) is 0.70918, essentially the same as that of the Mississippi River.

To the north, sites in the Red Wing locality in Minnesota and the Illinois River valley in Illinois show slightly higher signatures: between 0.7100 and 0.7110.

These data are consistent with that obtained by Price et al. (2007) from deer and small mammals found at Aztalan in southern Wisconsin.

Sites in eastern Illinois and the Ohio and Wabash River valleys of southern Illinois and Indiana have even higher strontium signatures: between 0.7110 and 0.7125.

Two sites in the Ozark Mountains of southwestern Missouri also have signatures between 0.7120 and 0.7125.

These data are similar to those found by Hedman et al. (2009:Table 1, 23LC188), who analyzed deer from archaeological contexts in caves in the Ozark Mountains (mean = 0.7121).

The highest and some of the most variable strontium signatures identified in this study were associated with the Cumberland Plateau in central Tennessee and the Ouachita Mountains of central Arkansas.

PARAGRAPH

In the central and southwestern region of Arkansas, a more complicated isotopic picture emerges.

The averaged means from 7 sites range from 0.71008 to 0.71693, a difference of 0.00685, which accounts for about 77% of the total variability found in our sample set (Table 1).

Notably, 87Sr/86Sr data obtained by Akridge (2014) and presented by Samuelsen (2016) for eight small mammal teeth from the Caddoan site of Crenshaw (locality number 25), located near three of the Arkansas localities included in this study (numbers 22–24), averaged only 0.70962, indicating that the Sr range may be even larger in this region.

Based on the complex geology observed for Arkansas in Fig. 1, these results are not necessarily surprising.

However, they do serve to indirectly highlight the remarkable similarity of strontium signatures up and down the Mississippi River.

Cahokia population diversity

PARAGRAPH

Fig. 5 shows stacked kernel density estimate (KDE) plots of 87Sr/86Sr ratios, one for our faunal isoscape sample and one for the pre-Columbian population of Cahokia, East St. Louis, and the American Bottom.

KDE is a non-parametric method for estimating the probability density function (PDF) of a continuous variable.

KDEs are analogous to histograms, but use a kernel function and a smoothing bandwidth to make better inferences about the underlying population given a finite sample.

KDE constructs the PDF by adding together individual kernels associated with each point in a dataset.

The shape of each kernel is controlled by the choice of probability distribution (e.g., triangular) and the size of the smoothing bandwidth (h), which influences the distance over which each point's influence is spread (larger values of h lead to a smoother, more dispersed PDF).

Fig. 5 uses a Gaussian kernel with a smoothing bandwidth (h) of 0.0001, which represents a good tradeoff between under- and over-smoothing.

The probability density for each group in Fig. 5 is stacked on the group below it, similar to the presentation in a stacked histogram.

These KDE plots allow us to better visualize the overall distribution of our 87Sr/86Sr data and generate meaningful predictions about the origins of Cahokia's population from our finite data sample.

PARAGRAPH

Looking at the fauna KDE in Fig. 4, we see that the data is polymodal and that there are four major peaks: (1) ≈ 0.7092 —localities 1, 3, 12, 13, 15, 26, 27, and 28; (2) ≈ 0.7100 — localities 2, 4, 8, 10, 11, 14, 18, 23, 25, and 31; (3) 0.7115–0.7125 — localities 5, 6, 7, 9, 16, 17, 20, 24, 29, and 32; and (4) 0.7135–0.7155 — localities 21, 22, and 30; plus one minor peak, (5) ≈ 0.7175 — locality 19.

PARAGRAPH

The lowest peak represents regions along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, that may have contributed to the population of Cahokia.

When plotted as its own group, the American Bottom peak (the taller, lighter lobe) is estimated at 0.7087–0.7100.

This is slightly larger than the regional signature we previously established for the American Bottom using the mean ± 2 ∗ SD of local fauna (0.7089–0.7097; Slater et al., 2014) but includes the larger tails generated by the KDE model.

The important point is that the previously established signature's mean (0.7093) and new KDE peak (~0.7092) are essentially identical.

The other four peaks (see above) represent higher strontium isotope signatures in the midcontinent and include regions that may have served as points of origin for Cahokia's immigrant population.

PARAGRAPH

The KDE plot of human tooth enamel from the American Bottom in Fig. 5 shows that there is one clear peak at ~0.7094, with an upper tail that stretches out to ~0.7110.

The lower tail drops off much quicker, at ~0.7085.

When the total sample is separated into groups representing Mound 72, Cahokia Precinct (9 locations not including Mound 72), East St. Louis Precinct, and other American Bottom sites, the peaks for Mound 72 and East St. Louis are more narrow than that of the Cahokia Precinct.

In fact, the Cahokia Precinct actually has one smaller peak at 0.70925 and an upper tail that extends from ~0.7100–0.7115.

Ultimately, the KDE model predicts a wider distribution of strontium isotope ratios for the Cahokia Precinct human sample as a whole than it does for either the East St. Louis or Mound 72 groups, although it is worth pointing out that a larger proportion of nonlocal ratios that fall between 0.7115 and 0.7125 are associated with Mound 72.

It is also notable that the largest peak on the KDE plot for American Bottom fauna occurs at 0.7092—most humans from the four American Bottom locations have very similar 87Sr/86Sr ratios to American Bottom fauna.

When taken together with the non-American Bottom fauna with its longer tail and wider distribution, the combined faunal sample corresponds well with the KDE plot of the Cahokia human subgroup.

PARAGRAPH

Strontium isotope ratios above 0.7125 are extremely rare in our sample of human teeth.

There are only 2 teeth (from a single individual) with ratios between 0.7125 and 0.7164, and only 4 teeth (representing 1 individual from East St. Louis and 1 individual from the Fingerhut Cemetery in the Cahokia Precinct) fall between 0.7165 and 0.7190 (note the small peaks on the top end of the human KDE plot).

These ratios are significantly different from the vast majority of our human sample and clearly represent a distinct region (or regions) of origin.

Finally, both KDE plots most clearly show that based on available data, the lower cutoff of strontium ratios we can reasonably expect to find in the midcontinent, whether we look at humans or fauna, is ~0.7085.

Revisiting the specific 87Sr/86Sr ratios, of the 338 individuals analyzed from the American Bottom as part of this project, 88, or 26%, fall outside the 0.70889–0.70973 local range established for the American Bottom (Table 2, Fig. 6, Supplemental Table 3).

If we consider only the individuals from the mound centers of Cahokia (including Mound 72) and East St. Louis, 65 of 267, or 24% individuals have at least one tooth with a nonlocal Sr signature (Table 2).

While this is lower than our previous assessment of 33% immigrants at Cahokia (Slater et al., 2014), it still indicates that at least one quarter of all Mississippian people in the American Bottom region were immigrants.

If we extend our definition of ‘local’ to include the area within a 30 km radius of Cahokia, 39 individuals, or 12%, still fall outside the larger 0.70874–0.71024 local range (Table 2, Fig. 6, Supplemental Table 3), including 25 of 267, or 9% of individuals from the mound centers of Cahokia (including Mound 72) and East St. Louis.

This suggests that many people could have come to Cahokia and the American Bottom from nearby regions (e.g., eastern Missouri, Lower Illinois River valley).

Additionally, tight clustering of 87Sr/86Sr ratios associated with some burial locations, such as Cahokia's Mound 72 F229-lower (Thompson et al., 2015), suggest some individuals shared distinct population histories and spatially circumscribed place of origin (from a region with a strontium signature that overlaps with that of the American Bottom) for some groups at Cahokia.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Since the nineteenth-century recognition of the immensity of Cahokia and its adjacent East St. Louis and St. Louis precincts, observers have realized that it must have contained a sizeable population.

While scholars debated about what caused this dense population nucleation that we now refer to as Greater Cahokia (Emerson, 2018a), they were generally silent on “whom” these individuals were and the roles they played within Greater Cahokia.

Most researchers sought to identify key causal variables to explain Cahokia's emergence, sometimes focusing on environmental conditions (Smith, 1978) but more often looking to such economic and social factors as Cahokia as a gateway center (Kelly, 1991), locus of a prestige economy (Peregrine, 1996), or host of regional markets (Gibbon, 1974; Porter, 1969).

Recently, Susan Alt and Timothy Pauketat have posited the role of religion as key in the creation of Cahokia, exploring the evidence at the Emerald Acropolis, a major Cahokian pilgrimage site, that appears to have accommodated hundreds, if not thousands, of pilgrims at seasonal astronomical events (e.g., Alt, 2006, 2018; Pauketat, 2012; Pauketat et al., 2017; Skousen, 2016).

This focus on the presence of pilgrims and traders has served us well, with researchers seeking to identify materials and cultural objects from areas and populations that Cahokians may have interacted with (e.g., see Boles et al., 2018; Kelly, 1991; Pauketat, 2004; Pauketat and Emerson, 1997; chapters in Emerson and Lewis, 1991 and Stoltman, 1991).

But the question had remained as to whether these foreign items represented goods from down-the-line trade, from foreign itinerant traders or elites visiting Cahokia, or a seldom discussed option, from local enclaves of immigrants who manufactured them.

Our research is beginning to suggest this last option of foreigner enclaves may be a viable possibility.

PARAGRAPH

Our results show that there are at least five relatively distinct strontium isotope regional signatures across the midcontinent.

This is promising for our goal of creating an isoscape capable of assisting in identifying pre-Columbian population movement in the Mississippi Valley.

This new data is especially pertinent in identifying immigrants to Cahokia because four of those signatures are distinctly different from those of the American Bottom.

This is especially true of regions with unique or uncommon signatures, such as the Ozark Mountains in Missouri and Ouachita Mountains in western Arkansas and southeastern Oklahoma.

However, there is considerable overlap in strontium isotope signatures across the midcontinent, including many regions indistinguishable from that of the American Bottom.

This precludes us from recognizing all nonlocal individuals in a region, or identifying place(s) of origin with certainty, based on strontium isotope ratios alone.

Interestingly, we may stand a better chance of identifying Cahokian emigrants at sites outside the American Bottom (e.g., Aztalan [Price et al., 2007], Fort Ancient [Cook and Price, 2015]) than of identifying the place of origin for immigrants to Cahokia.

PARAGRAPH

Given this, our estimate that immigrants constituted ~25% of the population in the American Bottom and Cahokia during the Mississippian period should be considered a minimum estimate; there are likely to be some individuals who migrated to Cahokia from regions with an overlapping Sr signature (Table 2).

Even if we extend the limits of our ‘local’ region to 30 km beyond Cahokia, at least 10% of the population is nonlocal.

Movement of people between these adjacent cultural regions is supported by both archaeological and biological evidence.

Tooth development and the age at which an individual moved between regions also impacts whether they are identifiable as immigrants.

Young children who moved to Cahokia before mineralization of their adult tooth crowns (under the age of 4 for M1, 8 for M2, and 15 for M3; White and Folkens, 2005:367), even if they were from a region with a distinct strontium signature, will have a mixed (nonlocal and local) or completely local strontium signal, depending on the age at which the sampled tooth formed.

These individuals will appear to be local to the region even if they came from elsewhere.

To be clear, the true percentage of immigrants to Cahokia is undoubtedly higher than our dataset suggests at first glance, although many of those people may have come from neighboring regions.

PARAGRAPH

Based on the overall distribution of 87Sr/86Sr data, it appears that a majority of nonlocal ratios in individuals fall between 0.7100 and 0.7110.

Unfortunately, that range includes 9 of the 32 regions from five different states (Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arkansas, and Ohio).

The overlap in local strontium signatures for these geographically distant regions makes it difficult to specify where Cahokia's immigrants may have come from based solely on the strontium isotope ratios.

There is also the possibility, of course, that other as yet untested regions also fall within this range.

What we can say is that there is a relatively continuous distribution of 87Sr/86Sr ratios from individuals that fall in this range and it is likely that they represent several different regions across multiple states in the midcontinent, rather than any single location.

A critical point is that—although there is some uncertainty as to the point of origin of many of these people—there is no doubt that they were from someplace outside of the immediate American Bottom region.

PARAGRAPH

The second major range for nonlocal ratios in individuals, including individuals from Mound 72, is between 0.7115 and 0.7125.

This range corresponds with the third highest peak on the fauna KDE plot and includes regions in Indiana and the Ozark Mountains of south-central Missouri.

The remaining nonlocal ratios associated with individuals from the American Bottom appear as high anomalies within the overall population, falling between 0.7164 and 0.7188.

This small group includes three individuals, two from the East St. Louis Precinct and one from the Fingerhut Cemetery within the Cahokia Precinct.

These ratios best correspond with the fifth highest peak on the fauna KDE plot (see Figs. 1 and 3, region 19) in the Ouachita Mountains region of central Arkansas; although, high Sr ratios might be expected in other regions such as the St. Francois region of Missouri and the Canadian Shield area of the northern Great Lakes.

Based on these data, combined with archaeological evidence, it is probable that some portion of Cahokia's immigrants came from the area around the Ozark Mountains of Missouri and Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas.

This origin point is further supported by archaeological evidence (e.g., ceramic and stone artifacts) for significant early cultural contact between these regions during the Mississippian period (e.g., Boles et al., 2018).

Conclusion

PARAGRAPH

This research has provided further insight into the demographic history of the Mississippi Valley, with a special emphasis on the American Bottom and Cahokia, during the Mississippian period.

We used strontium isotope analysis of small fauna from different regions in the midcontinent to create an isoscape to assist in identifying pre-Columbian population movement.

An additional goal of this research was to use this isoscape to examine an enlarged human sample from Cahokia and the American Bottom in the hopes of identifying possible place(s) of origin of immigrants by matching individuals' 87Sr/86Sr ratios from their tooth enamel to regional 87Sr/86Sr ratios determined from fauna.

We found that the fauna analyzed from each region produced generally narrow isotope ranges but that, unfortunately, the range of each region often overlapped with that of several others by 50–75% and typically could not be distinguished from one another other.

One intriguing exception to this pattern are the samples from the Ouachita Mountains area of Arkansas that produced 87Sr/86Sr ratios over 0.7150 and provide an identifiable strontium signature that is very similar to that of a small number of individuals from Cahokia.

Larger and more diverse faunal samples might allow further refinement of the Sr range for the midcontinent.

However, if we are to continue to refine these results, we must consider other datasets, including archaeological, isotopic, biological, and mortuary data.

PARAGRAPH

This study continues our efforts to identify the movement of people into (and out of) Cahokia, and strengthens our ability to identify the potential places of origin for a subset of Cahokia's immigrants (i.e., nonlocal 87Sr/86Sr ratios), consequently further enhancing our understanding of the diversity within Cahokia's population (Hedman et al., 2009; Slater et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 2015).

We have shown that while a majority of the population have strontium isotope ratios that appear local to the American Bottom region, there is significant overlap in 87Sr/86Sr which means some of these individuals may in fact be immigrants from geographical regions that share isotopic characteristics with the American Bottom.

A minimum of ~25% of Cahokia's population were immigrants, having Sr ratios that fall outside the range of local Sr determined for the American Bottom.

These individuals came from a number of different geographic locations across the midcontinent.

It is possible that many of these people were drawn from populations located within 30 km of Cahokia, but others were clearly drawn from more distant regions.

These results confirm our previous assertion (Slater et al., 2014) that Cahokia's population was a heterogeneous mixture of people from diverse cultural backgrounds.

Ongoing archaeological investigations have shown that Cahokia is, in fact, North America's first urban polity (Emerson, 2018a, 2018b; Emerson et al., 2018; Pauketat, 2012; Pauketat et al., 2015).

The demonstrated presence of these heterogeneous populations provides key insights into contextualizing and understanding the innovative religious, social, and political structures associated with the emergence of this unique polity (sensu Emerson and Hedman, 2016; Emerson, 2018b; Emerson et al., 2018; Pauketat, 2004, 2012).

End notes

PARAGRAPH

We generally categorize population relocations to Greater Cahokia from within the American Bottom region as “movement” with the term “migration” being reserved for relocations by populations from outside the American Bottom.

It is suggested elsewhere (Emerson, 2018a, 2018b) that both local movement and external migrations, given the assumed band and tribal organizational structure of social groups outside of Greater Cahokia, would be primarily by affiliated kin groups.

This form of native population coalescence is well documented in the post-contact Eastern United States (e.g., Kowalewski, 2006).

Previous research (Emerson and Hedman, 2016; Slater et al., 2014) has demonstrated that Greater Cahokia was a fluid social-political construct that groups joined and left on a regular basis throughout its several hundred-year history.
