TITLE

Hunting social networks on the Salish Sea before and after the bow and arrow

PARAGRAPH

Archaeologists have focused on the social changes coinciding with the widespread use of bow and arrow technologies in North America, and specifically on the Northwest Coast the emergence of large plank house villages.

Variation in the styles of stone tools used for darts and arrows from dated archaeological sites in Puget Sound and southwest British Columbia was examined using social network analysis.

Social networks continued to expand and strengthened until 1600 BP when the bow and arrow became widely used in the area.

These findings suggest that hunting shifted from a collective activity to an individualized pursuit.
