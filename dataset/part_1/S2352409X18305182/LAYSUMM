Astragalar morphology: Approaching the cultural trajectories of wild and domestic sheep applying Geometric Morphometrics

PARAGRAPH

Sheep is a highly diverse livestock species with breeds raised for wool, milk, meat and fat or combinations of these products.

But the emergence of lineages bred for these traits is still not very well understood.

We apply a Geometric Morphometric approach to the ankle bones of eight domestic and wild sheep populations from Europe, SW and Central Asia.

By comparing the shape of the ankle bones of these modern and prehistoric populations we evaluated their morphological relationships.

Our study allows concluding that wool and fat-tailed sheep represent lineages that independently emerged in the Near East during the Bronze Age.
