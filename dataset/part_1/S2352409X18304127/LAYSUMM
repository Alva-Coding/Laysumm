Search for new final Palaeolithic rock shelter sites in the Federal State of Hesse

PARAGRAPH

This paper discusses the search for new rock-shelter containing Final Palaeolithic archaeology sites in the German Federal State of Hesse.

In finding new settlements of late ice age hunter-gatherers and volcanic ash of the Laacher See eruption, the project seeks to investigate the effects of this potentially catastrophic event 13.000 years ago.

By employing an archaeological predictive model in combination with a legacy database of potential rock-shelters, a set of locations was determined which will be subject to subsequent fieldwork.

In this article, we are presenting the model, its performance and selected locations for first keyhole field investigations.
