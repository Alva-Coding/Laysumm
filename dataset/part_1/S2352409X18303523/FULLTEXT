TITLE

Sources of the ochres associated with the Lower Magdalenian “Red Lady” human burial and rock art in El Mirón Cave (Cantabria, Spain)

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

The instrumental analysis of ochres has provided important information on the various uses of these mineral oxides in prehistory (e.g., García Borja et al., 2004; Bersani and Lottici, 2016; Eiselt et al., 2011; Marshall et al., 2005; Mooney et al., 2003; Popelka et al., 2007, 2008, 2016; Rifkin et al., 2016; Ferrier et al., 2017), including Upper Paleolithic cave painting (Clottes et al., 1990a, 1990b; Hernanz et al., 2010, 2012; Hernanz, 2015; Iriarte et al., 2009, 2017; Seva Román et al., 2015), and possible use by Neanderthals (Zilhão, 2001; Zilhão et al., 2010; D'Errico et al., 1998, 2010; Hovers et al., 2003; Roebroeks et al., 2012).

The arguably symbolic use of red ochre has been documented from archeological sites in Africa, the Near East and Europe dating as early as the Acheulean and Middle Paleolithic/Middle Stone Age, and may be a fundamentally common characteristic of genus Homo (e.g., Wreschner, 1980; Watts, 2002; Hovers et al., 2003).

PARAGRAPH

Here we continue the analysis of the Magdalenian use of ochres from the major Paleolithic and post-Paleolithic site of El Mirón Cave on the northern edge of the Cantabrian Cordillera in Ramales (eastern Cantabria Province, Spain) that was excavated between 1996 and 2013 by Straus and González Morales (e.g., González-Morales and Straus, 2000, 2009; Straus and González Morales, 2003; Straus and González-Morales, 2012a, 2012b; Straus et al., 2002, 2011).

In particular, the study of the “Red Lady” Lower Magdalenian human burial directly dated to 18.7 cal.

kya and monographically published by González Morales and Straus (2015), found that the sediments covering the skeleton were rich in ochres and idiomorphic hematite of non-local origin (Seva Román et al., 2015).

PARAGRAPH

The purpose of this article is empirically to determine whether the red ochres intimately associated with the burial and found on adjacent and nearby rock surfaces were of local or non-local origin.

A finding for the latter possibility would confirm the very special, presumably ritualized nature of the use of red pigment with hematite crystals in the context of the burial.

Such a determination would positively add to the interpretation of complex burial practices entailing considerable effort by societal members for at least certain deceased individuals, as is already known from numerous burials of Magdalenian age (including several adult females), as well as from Epigravettian and earlier Upper Paleolithic interments throughout Europe (including Portugal) (see Pettitt, 2011; Henry-Gambier, 2018; Uthmeier, 2018), but now for the first time from Spain.

PARAGRAPH

From local geological maps (IGME, 1974a, 1974b, 1978, 1982; Vera, 2004), we had previously deduced that the kind of hematite found at the burial could be located from Monte Buciero.

This hill has a height of 378 m and dominates the present mouth of the Asón River in the town of Santoña.

About 22 km in a straight line from El Mirón, this hill contains Magdalenian and Azilian cave and rockshelter sites.

We conducted a field prospection and collected samples for analysis and comparison with ochres from the burial deposit (Level 504) and from the eastern surface of a large (2.1 × 1.4 × 0.9 m) limestone block immediately adjacent to the burial.

One goal was to obtain information on the possible relationship of the ochre on the block to the burial.

It had been demonstrated stratigraphically and by AMS radiocarbon dating that the block had fallen during the Lower Magdalenian period “soon” (i.e. <19.7 cal.

kya) before the burial, creating a c. 1 m-wide space between it and the SE cave wall at the vestibule rear.

Furthermore– and most suggestive– the western face of the block (which is the flat, inner surface that had detached from the cave ceiling), bears numerous linear engravings (including the possible representation of a vulva) that were progressively covered over by later Magdalenian-age occupation deposits.

The terminus post and ante quem dates for the engravings indicate that they had been made roughly contemporaneously with the burial behind the block and that this decorated block could have been a kind of grave marker (González Morales and Straus, 2014, 2015).

The ochre staining in the area of the eastern face of the block that was intimately contiguous with the burial may also have been related to ritual associated with the interment, hence the interest in comparing the compositions of the ochre in the burial deposit with the staining on the block and in conclusively identifying the non-local origin of these pigments.

PARAGRAPH

We also analyzed ochres from the sediments of overlying levels 503 (Lower Magdalenian, c. 18.3 cal.

kya) and 501 (mixed Magdalenian and post-Paleolithic), as well as from red staining laterally adjacent (but not stratigraphically related) to the engraved image of horse on the cave wall close (c.6 m) to the burial to gather information on potential variability of ochre sources and preparation prior to pigment use for artistic and ritual purposes possibly related to the burial.

Although the horse image cannot be directly dated, a Magdalenian age would seem reasonable, based on the stylistic analysis and evaluation of the heights of other nearby engravings above adjacent Lower Magdalenian occupation surfaces, assuming that the artist(s) worked in standing position (García Díez et al., 2012).

Materials and methods

PARAGRAPH

The analyzed samples (Table 1) were taken at three different spots that had been mined for iron ore in antiquity on Monte Buciero (Fig. 1), as well as from El Mirón Cave (Fig. 2): archeological Levels 501, 503 (ochre stains on limestone rock surfaces), and 504 (ochre from sediment) (Fig. 3), as well as from pigment on the block at the height of the top of the sedimentary deposit in the burial area (avoiding possible contamination from ochres in the deeper burial layer [504]) (Fig. 4).

In addition, we were able to take a very small sample of red-stained limestone rock from area adjacent to the engraved image of a horse on the cave wall (Fig. 5).

PARAGRAPH

The samples were analyzed using the following instrumental techniques:

PARAGRAPH

To observe the morphological structure we used a ZEISS Stereo Discovery V8 binocular microscope at 10–80 power with ZEN Imaging Software 2.3.

PARAGRAPH

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was applied in order to obtain surface images and the elemental composition of the samples.

Percentages of the main chemical elements were determined by means of an energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis probe (EDX).

A HITACHI S-3000N device was used, equipped with a secondary electron detector (photomultiplier type E with 3.5 nm resolution), a semiconductor back-scattered electron detector (with 5 nm resolution), as well as an X-ray detector capable of determining elements from Carbon to Uranium.

PARAGRAPH

For X-ray diffraction (XRD) examination was done on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray Diffractometer with CuKα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA).

Each sample was scanned over the 2-theta range 4–85°, with a step size of 0.05° and a count time of 3–6 s per step.

The X-ray diffractograms were interpreted using the DIFFRAC plus Basic (Evaluation Release 2009) software.

PARAGRAPH

Raman spectra were obtained using a dispersive Raman spectrometer LabRam Jobin Ivon Horiba, with 500 mm focal distance.

The laser used in the analysis was the 632.8 nm HeNe laser with 7 mW of power focused on the sample.

The Raman was coupled with an Olympus BX40 confocal microscope.

A 50× LWD objective was used to focus the laser into a 5 μm spot.

The diffraction grating used was 600 lines/mm that results in a spectral resolution close to 3 cm−1.

Prior to sample analysis, calibration of the Raman shift was carried out using the 520 cm−1 Raman line of a silicon wafer.

Post-processing of the spectra was done by mathematical baseline subtraction and a subsequent soft smoothing of the signals.

PARAGRAPH

Trace elements were analyzed by inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP–MS) via THERMO ELEMENTAL VG PQ-ExCell, after sample acid digestion in a microwave oven system (Milestone Start D).

Quantities in ppm (mg/Kg) of the different atomic elements present in samples were obtained.

The statistical calculations were run with IBM SPSS statistics 24 for Win, using cluster analysis from a distance matrix (Todd and Leonard, 2010), of the following elements: Li, Be, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Se, Sr, Mo, Cd, ln, Tl, Bi, Th, U, Sn, y Cs.

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

The samples were observed with a binocular microscope to analyze the presence and morphology of hematite crystals.

In Fig. 6 we present several representative micro-photographs.

PARAGRAPH

The three samples from the Monte Buciero prospections (Dolinas 1–3) included fragments of hematite, the largest number and sizes of which were from Dolina 2.

PARAGRAPH

The samples from levels 501 y 503 contained hardly any hematite crystals.

In contrast, Level 504 sediments yielded large numbers of well-differentiated, crystals.

PARAGRAPH

The sample from the ochre staining on the block yielded small crystals that were well integrated within the sample.

PARAGRAPH

The sample from the ochre “paint” adjacent to the horse image is intensely red in color, but displays no idiomorphic hematite crystals.

PARAGRAPH

The sample from the Monte Buciero Dolina 2 outcrop is worthy of special note.

It contained large, uniformly distributed fragments of hematite which are clearly distinguishable in terms of their form, shine and color.

We were able to separate one fragment on a sample holder and to photograph it through the binocular microscope by modifying the angle of the light source to observe its particular shine and color (Fig. 7).

PARAGRAPH

One can observe that in the samples from Dolina 2, Block and Level 504 there is more idiomorphic crystalline hematite than in the outcrop samples from Dolinas 1 and 3.

The ochres from the surfaces of limestone rocks in Levels 501 y 503 do not present this mineral in crystalline form, which indicates a different origin and nature.

PARAGRAPH

The sample from the paint adjacent to the horse engraving is completely different.

It is a very elaborate iron oxide without hematite crystals.

It presents major textural differences vis à vis the ochre stain on the block.

PARAGRAPH

By means of SEM we detected hematite crystals in all other samples (the mixed Level 501 sample was not studied with SEM).

We present the most indicative images in Fig. 8 and Table 2 summarizes the results we achieved via electronic probe.

PARAGRAPH

The results obtained by SEM confirm the observations previously made by binocular microscope.

PARAGRAPH

The samples from the three Dolinas, the burial layer (504) and the paint on the block all contained idiomorphic hematite crystals of the same nature and origin.

This fact shows that Monte Buciero was the source of the specific, hematite crystal-rich ochre that had been used to stain the Red Lady's bones (during reburial) and possibly also skin (at the time of original burial), as well as the face of the block immediately adjacent to her grave.

PARAGRAPH

On the other hand, the percentages of iron content revealed by SEM analysis for the five above-mentioned ochres are similar.

Similarly, it is noteworthy that there are substantial differences between these samples vis à vis ochres from Level 503 (above the burial) and the pigment on the cave wall in the area of the engraved horse image.

PARAGRAPH

Another aspect worthy of attention and which helps us to distinguish the production of pigment based on hematite that was applied to the surface of the block next to the burial (also from Monte Buciero) is the appearance of phosphorus (hydroxyapatite) from micro-fragments of bones that had been mixed with the ochre (Fig. 9, Table 3).

This ochre presents significant differences with the ochre used on the cave wall.

PARAGRAPH

In the case of the pigment adjacent to the horse image, this is a much more elaborate material than that of the ochre stain on the block, with a much finer granulometry and without crystals of the characteristics described above.

Another fact is the absence of phosphorous (hydroxyapatite) in the pigment staining the cave wall patina, indicating that people used a suspension without bone microfragments in marked contrast to the pigment on the block.

PARAGRAPH

By means of X-ray diffraction we were able to establish a comparison between the sediments collected on Monte Buciero and Level 504—the fill of the burial.

The samples were subjected to treatment in hydrochloric acid (HCl 1:1), in order to eliminate carbonates that could have interfered in post-depositional phenomena, given their properties.

PARAGRAPH

The results show a clear correlation between Dolina 2 and Level 504 (Fig. 10).

The samples from Dolinas 1 and 3, although they display similar spectra, vary in terms of feldspars and hematite.

These data consolidate the evidence that the ochre contents of the sediments that covered the Red Lady had been obtained from the slope of Monte Buciero.

PARAGRAPH

By means of the Raman spectra obtained from the samples (Fig. 11), we detected the presence of crystalline phases.

The peaks in the graph have been assigned to signals corresponding to a specific crystalline phase (Table 4).

PARAGRAPH

In this table one can observe that the principal phase of the analyzed pigments among the various samples correspond to hematite (α–Fe2O3), with Raman peaks at 222, 290, 409, 609, 656 y 1450 cm−1, there being no clear presence of other iron oxide phase such as maghemite (γ-Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), or goethite (α-FeOOH) (Hanesch, 2009; De Faria et al., 1997).

Thus we can affirm that hematite was the principal ochre utilized for painting.

PARAGRAPH

On the other hand, the ochre samples from Levels 501 and 503 present Raman signals of a phase that is not iron oxide.

The sharp peak in the spectrum around 1090 cm−1 clearly shows the presence of ion carbonate (CO32−) that could be assigned to the presence of calcite or dolomite crystalline phases.

However, these aggregates display Raman displacements toward slightly lower frequencies (around 1080 cm−1 for the principal peak).

The Raman peaks obtained for these samples are slightly displaced from the theoretical signals (1090 cm−1 for the principal peak).

This fact, together with the dark red color of the analyzed zone seems to indicate that the presence of ion carbonate is in the form of siderite (FeCO3), or a mixture of thereof with the above-mentioned phases (CaCO3 y MgCO3).

PARAGRAPH

There is no presence of other crystalline phases except for the case of the sample from the block in which we observed weak signals in the region of 900–1100 cm−1 that could be due to the presence of silicates.

PARAGRAPH

We were unable to obtain a spectrum from the Dolina 3 sample, because it presented strong fluorescence.

This fluorescence is of indeterminate origin and is common in Raman analyses of some clays and silicates.

PARAGRAPH

In order to obtain more information on the Raman spectra, we conducted an analysis of the peak at 400 cm−1 among those samples that present one.

Concretely we adjusted the signal to a Lorentzian function to calculate the width at its mid-height (FWHM).

This width is related to crystallinity and the level of defects possessed by the hematite that are present in the sample.

The results are given in Table 5.

PARAGRAPH

The ochres from Levels 503 and 504, as well as from Dolina 2, possess the narrowest widths at peak mid-height (25,4; 30,1 and 26,8 cm−1, respectively).

These samples present microcrystalline hematite with a markedly organized structure.

PARAGRAPH

The ochre from mixed Level 501 could not be analyzed because it displayed no hematite phase.

PARAGRAPH

The Level 503 sample, extracted from the surface of a limestone rock, displays a microcrystalline hematite phase analogous to that of Level 504 and Dolina 2, but with the addition of siderite.

The composition of the Level 503 ochre suggests the possibility—given the near-contemporaneous C14 dates (Straus et al., 2015)—of admixture of ochres from underlying Level 504.

The appearance of siderite in the Level 503 sample is indicative of local materials geologically known in the valleys of the upper Asón or its tributary, the Carranza River.

PARAGRAPH

In contrast to the previously discussed samples, the Dolina 1 sample presents a very disorganized microcrystalline hematite (48,6 cm−1) which is quite different from the material used in the burial fill.

PARAGRAPH

The analysis of the FWHM parameter indicates that the hematite crystals found in the Level 504 and Dolina 2 ochres have very similar characteristic, leading us to think that they were of common origin with the former coming from the Monte Buciero source.

PARAGRAPH

Fig. 12 displays the Raman spectra of the red pigments used in the paint on the Block and on the cave wall adjacent to the horse image.

Although both spectra correspond to hematite phase, they are clearly different.

For the cave wall pigment, the widths of the peaks at 400 y 600–700 cm−1 are very great.

In fact, it is not possible to differentiate the peaks at 610 and 660 cm−1, since they appear as one peak, given their overlap.

Thus, the pigments utilized in this sample present a hematite with great structural disorder, much greater than that of the pigments found in the block sample or in the rest of the analyzed ochres.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

From these data of the two paints (the stains on the block and on the cave wall), we can suggest various hypotheses.

The first would be the development of a more sophisticated pigment elaboration, from a coarser to a finer granulometry (smaller particles contain more structural defects).

This idea does seem to be coherent in the studies of the caves of Tito Bustillo and El Buxu in eastern Asturias (c. 125 km to the West) by A. Hernanz et al. (2012).

The dispersion of the pigment in water or in agglutinant and its application on rock are more effective when particle size is smaller.

Another hypothesis is that the elaboration of this pigment could have been done by means of heating the goethite or other iron oxides at a minimum of 260 °C (Perinet and Onoratini, 1987; García Borja et al., 2004; Cavallo et al., 2018), thus modifying its structure and color and producing as a result an amorphous hematite that does not occur naturally.

PARAGRAPH

The use of pigments with a low crystallinity in the case of the pigment adjacent to the horse image area indicates that it could be prepared utilizing techniques different from the one used in producing the stain on the block.

PARAGRAPH

Another conclusion obtained from the data in Table 5 is that the paint on the block was made with more disorganized hematite than those of the Level 504 ochre sample.

As is discussed above, this fact could have been due to physicochemical processes that had taken place during the production of these pigments in preparation for their different applications.

PARAGRAPH

Even more conclusive is the analysis of minority elements among the data obtained by means of ICP-MS (Fig. 13).

We analyzed multiple trace elements, eliminating those that could alter the result of the statistical calculation either because of anthropic modifications such as phosphorous (P), or by saturation given local geology.

PARAGRAPH

From these results we can conclude:

The samples from Level 504 of the burial and the painting on the block are of the same nature as those from Dolinas 1 and 2 located on the upper slopes of Monte Buciero.

Dolina 3 yielded a sample that is only slightly different from the others.

The Level 503 ochre is of a completely different nature.

SECTION

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

Based on these results we can make the following conclusions:

The ochre used in the Red Lady burial was brought from Monte Buciero, in Santoña, about 27 km from El Mirón Cave.

In order to paint the eastern face of the block in the area contiguous with the burial, people utilized the same ochre as in the burial, but with the addition of microfragments of bone together presumably with some (non-detected) agglutinant, such as animal or vegetal fat.

The ochre utilized in the pigment on the cave wall adjacent to the horse image was made of goethite which was heated and pounded, thus producing a redder tone and an extremely fine granulometry.

Triturated bone was not utilized in this paint.

It is an iron oxide that is very abundant in the vicinity of the cave in the upper Asón and tributary Carranza valleys, which we also prospected and sampled.

The ochres utilized in the upper strata (501 y 503), are of a completely different nature and are geologically more similar to the iron oxide outcrops in the above-mentioned valleys, with the appearance of siderite.

In its elaboration, as in its granulometry and composition, the paint on the block is completely different from the pigment adjacent to the engraved horse image on the cave wall.

PARAGRAPH

Thus, we can affirm that the painted block is intimately linked to the Red Lady burial, with its staining no doubt having been part of the ritual associated with the interment.

PARAGRAPH

The Lower Magdalenian people went to great lengths to extract and then transport sediment rich in iron in the form of idiomorphic hematite over a distance of about 27 km following a route along the valley floor of the Asón (Fig. 14), mix it with fill from the excavation of the burial pit, and then cover over the corpse of the Red Lady.

This, along with the complex elaboration of the pigment, was a labor-intensive activity to say the least, also involving the preparation of paint to stain the block next to her body, not to mention the digging of the shallow pit, all of which leads us to imagine the importance of this person within the social group that inhabited El Mirón Cave at the time.

In addition, at least some bones seem to have been directly stained during a partial reburial episode following limited carnivore disturbance of the skeleton (Marín-Arroyo, 2015).

PARAGRAPH

These results clearly indicate that humans of Lower Magdalenian culture during Oldest Dryas went to great trouble to procure non-local ochre with sparkling hematite crystals to be mixed with the backfill of the grave of a 35–40 year-old woman and to stain the large limestone block that separated her burial from the main living space of the El Mirón Cave vestibule.

Although locally available ochres were commonly used (presumably for both decoration and hide preparation/preservation) throughout the Magdalenian occupations of the site, the “Red Lady's” pigment was carried from Monte Buciero 22 lineal km to the north of the site.

This hill dominates the coastal plain of eastern Cantabria which, in Oldest Dryas would have been about 5 km wider than it is today at the mouth of the Asón River.

Contact (perhaps seasonal) with the Late Glacial shore is abundantly evidenced in the Lower Magdalenian levels by the presence of numerous marine mollusks, some of which were made into beads, as well as by the procurement of lithic raw materials (flints) from the same area.

The very fact that “the Red Lady” was given a burial, when there is no other evidence of interment of complete corpses in the entire Magdalenian of the whole Iberian Peninsula, suggests that she was indeed given “special treatment”.

This is also suggested by the engravings on the western face of the block (including the multi-line inverted triangular possible female “vulva” symbol) that might “mark” her grave and by the facts that her cranium and major limb bones were removed (perhaps for display or deposition in [an] other place[s]) and that she was reburied and her bones stained with ochre after her corpse had been disturbed by a carnivore (possibly a wolf) (Marín-Arroyo, 2015).

By means of the mineralogical analyses reported on here and in our earlier article (Seva Román et al., 2015) we have shown the truly special treatment that the “Red Lady” was given in death, hinting at an unusual status and/or role during her life.

PARAGRAPH

Finally, we can suggest as a hypothesis that the composition of the paints made of iron oxide either with or without the addition of bone microfragments, with coarser or finer granulometry, or with heating at temperatures above 260 °C, all could depend on the application technique to be used (by aerograph, pieces of animal hide, osseous, lithic or wooden tools), or even the kind of representation that was to be painted (discs, animals, hands, etc.).

PARAGRAPH

In his recent, comprehensive survey of Stone Age human burials, P. Pettitt (2011) describes 25 human burials (out of a total of about 60 including the 20 with no observed ochre in the Předmostí “cemetery” in Moravia) of Gravettian age (c. 30–20 uncal.

kya) which contained ochre.

After all, the original “Red Lady”” in Paviland Cave [Wales] was a Gravettian-age male slathered in ochre.

The other Gravettian burials with ochre are Cro-Magnon (5 individuals), Cussac No.3, Lagar Velho, Brno (2), Dolní Vĕstonice (4), Krems (2), Arene Candide (“Il Principe”), Barma Grande (3), Ostuni No.1, Kostenki No.14, Sungir (3) (Pettitt, 2011: Table 6.2).

While there are few or no burials of undisputed Solutrean age (except perhaps in El Parpalló [Valencia] [Gambier, 2018: 41]), there are several known Magdalenian-age burials from France (>13), Germany (4) and Poland (1), and many from the Epigravettian of Italy (21) and Russia (2).

But those with recorded ochre are relatively few; in the Magdalenian: Bonn-Oberkassel, Les Hoteaux, La Madeleine, Chancelade and Les Iboussières; in the Epigravettian of Italy: Tagliente, San Teodoro (5) and in Vilabruna there were blocks with red painted geometric designs atop the skeleton (Pettitt, 2011: Table 7.1).

PARAGRAPH

In some of the Magdalenian burials the ochre was accompanied by very likely grave offerings (perforated shells and teeth—very abundant in the cases of La Madeleine and Saint-Germain-la-Rivière No.2 [Vanhaeren and D'Errico, 2001, 2003]—and other unusual or special artifacts).

However, in only one of the burials with any evidence of associated archeological materials—Chancelade—was ochre the only apparent grave offering.

This seems to have been the case of El Mirón, but in addition to the abundant, non-local, specially- and elaborately-prepared hematite ochre, it is very possible that the engravings and red staining on the adjacent block, as well as the removal of the cranium and most of the major long bones (perhaps at the time of the reburial), are all indications of considerable investment and elaborate ritual in the treatment and possible memorialization of this unusual woman.

In the context of the Iberian Magdalenian, when isolated human remains are occasionally present among the trash of habitation levels (as in the famous case of the two frontal bones in Obermaier's early Magdalenian Beta layer in nearby El Castillo Cave [Garralda, 1992] and the recent finds of isolated teeth, phalanges and fragments of a maxilla and a metacarpal of apparent Upper Magdalenian age in Galeria da Cisterna, Portugal [Trinkaus et al., 2011]), the “Red Lady” burial was both regionally unique and part of a wider, continental burial tradition reserved for a special few throughout Western Europe during the Late Glacial.

Like Saint-Germain-la-Rivière 2, the fact that the El Mirón burial is that of a woman is suggestive of a Magdalenian society in which a few females as well as males could achieve some status deserving of remarkable treatment after death, including the acquisition of over 70 perforated red deer canines possibly from Cantabrian Spain for a burial in the site near Bordeaux (where red deer were absent or extremely rare during the Late Glacial) and that of a peculiar hematite ochre deliberately sought out from an outcrop near the Cantabrian coast and transported to the edge of the Cantabrian Cordillera.

Such behavior in the context of burials can been seen as costly signaling indicative of societal respect (possibly at a regional level) for extraordinary individuals in what were otherwise presumably egalitarian hunter-gatherer bands.

The bright red color of and marking the El Mirón interment, as in so many burial contexts throughout time and space, can be interpreted as having had powerful symbolic value with reference to blood and its associations with human life, reproduction and death.
