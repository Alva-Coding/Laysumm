TITLE

Stochastic parallel extreme artificial hydrocarbon networks: An implementation for fast and robust supervised machine learning in high-dimensional data

PARAGRAPH

In this paper, we introduce a super-fast supervised machine learning method, namely stochastic parallel extreme artificial hydrocarbon networks, or simply SPE-AHN.

This model includes a simple batch learning process for consuming large amounts of data while training an artificial hydrocarbon network using nature-inspired optimization in parallel.

In machine learning for large and big data, it requires novel solutions on model scalability, predictive power and fast training time.

Thus, our method provides an alternative to this challenging problem.

We anticipate our new method will be useful in many data-driven applications using large amounts of data, like in robotics, finance, health, aerospace, and many others.
