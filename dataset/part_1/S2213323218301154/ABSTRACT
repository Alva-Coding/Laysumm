ABSTRACT

TITLE

Mesial temporal extraventricular neurocytoma (mtEVN): A case report and literature review

PARAGRAPH

We describe a case of mesial temporal extraventricular neurocytoma (mtEVN) in a 23-year-old male presenting with drug-resistant seizures and review the literature on this rare tumor.

PARAGRAPH

A PubMed search was queried using the MeSH term “neurocytoma” and key search terms “extraventricular”, “temporal”, and “epilepsy”.

Titles and abstracts were screened for temporal neurocytomas.

References were reviewed to identify further studies.

PARAGRAPH

Twenty case reports were selected comparing the presentation, radiological, histopathological, and surgical outcomes of neocortex temporal EVNs (ntEVN) and mtEVNs.

PARAGRAPH

Gross total resection of mtEVNs under intraoperative electrocorticography monitoring typically affords an excellent prognosis and successful seizure control.
