TITLE

Pottery from Orduña Village in the 17th–19th centuries: An archaeometrical approach

PARAGRAPH

The village of Orduña has played throughout centuries as an important exchange point.

Recently, first material relicts evidencing pottery production were found in archaeological excavations, where numerous ceramic sherds along with at least one ceramic kiln dated back to the 17th-19th century were unearthed.

In the present work, a selection of 100 sherds have been subjected to a multi-analytical approach by ICPMS, XRD and SEM-EDS.

The results allowed establishing seven compositional groups responding to different technotypes and depicting the diachronic evolution of the ceramic production.

In addition, the main technological features used by the potters of Orduña were identified.
