ABSTRACT

TITLE

Overlapping demyelinating syndrome and anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis with seizures

PARAGRAPH

Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis, the most recognized type of autoimmune encephalitis, manifests with rapid cognitive decline, psychosis, and seizures that develop in 78â€“86% of patients.

Recently, anti-NMDAR encephalitis was reported in association with demyelinating diseases which are accompanied by a characteristic clinical phenotype, imaging abnormalities, and the presence of antibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG-IgG) in bodily fluids.

The patient presented herein suffered from bilateral optic neuritis followed by recurrent encephalitis with focal seizures and demonstrated anti-NMDAR and MOG-IgGs in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum, respectively.

Her symptoms responded to immunotherapy and antiseizure medication.

The recognition of the novel syndrome of MOG antibody-associated demyelination (MOGAD), encompassing the overlapping anti-NMDAR encephalitis and other MOG-IgG associated disorders, is important for the successful management of these patients.
