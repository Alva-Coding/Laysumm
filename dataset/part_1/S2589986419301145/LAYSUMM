TITLE

Overlapping demyelinating syndrome and anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis with seizures

PARAGRAPH

Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) autoimmune encephalitis, a nonbacterial inflammatory disease of the brain that presents with headache, confusion, and seizures.

In a few patients, it can co-occur with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein associated demyelination (MOGAD), the disease targeting the nerve sheath causing damage to the optic nerve and weakness in arms or legs.

Using corticosteroid as anti-inflammatory therapy, we successfully treated a patient who developed blindness.

She subsequently developed recurrent seizures from anti-NMDAR encephalitis and her serum tested positive for MOG antibodies leading to the diagnosis of overlapping MOGAD.

MOGAD should be suspected in all patients with unusual presentation of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.
