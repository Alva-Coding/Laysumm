TITLE

Working memory deficit in drug-resistant epilepsy with an amygdala lesion

PARAGRAPH

Brain areas in the non-dominant hemisphere (usually the right) are generally regarded as not crucial for language-related functions.

Our results, however, indicated the existence of memory-related function in the amygdala in this hemisphere.

The drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with amygdala lesion (AL) in the right hemisphere without hippocampal sclerosis (HS) exhibited noticeable decline of Working Memory (WM) compared with the TLE-HS patients.

We also revealed that glucose hypometabolism was minimal for the right TLE-AL patients.

Our results suggest that presurgical counseling regarding a possibility of postsurgical cognitive deficit would benefit the surgical candidates.
