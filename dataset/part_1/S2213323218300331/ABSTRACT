ABSTRACT

TITLE

Working memory deficit in drug-resistant epilepsy with an amygdala lesion

PARAGRAPH

This study compared temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with amygdala lesion (AL) without hippocampal sclerosis (HS) (TLE-AL) with patients with TLE and HS without AL (TLE-HS).

Both subtypes of TLE arose from the right hemisphere.

PARAGRAPH

The TLE-AL group exhibited a lower Working Memory Index (WMI) on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, third edition (WAIS-III), indicating that the amygdala in the right hemisphere is involved in memory-related function. [

18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission topography (FDG-PET) showed glucose hypometabolism limited to the right uncus for the TLE-AL group.

PARAGRAPH

The results suggest the importance of considering cognitive functions in the non-dominant hemisphere to prevent impairment after surgery.
