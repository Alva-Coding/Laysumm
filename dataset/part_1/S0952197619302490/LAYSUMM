TITLE

A combined entropy-based approach for a proactive credit scoring

PARAGRAPH

Credit card companies and banks use credit scores to evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers and, therefore, mitigating losses due to bad debt.

Within the financial technology domain, an ideal approach should be able to operate proactively, without the need of knowing the behavior of non-reliable users.

Actually, this does not happen because the most-used techniques need to train their models with both reliable and non-reliable data.

In this paper, we propose a proactive approach, composed of a combined entropy-based method that is trained considering only reliable cases and the sample under investigation.
