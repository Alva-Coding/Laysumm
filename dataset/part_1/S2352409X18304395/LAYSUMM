TITLE

Origins of Epipalaeolithic obsidian artifacts from Garrod's excavations at Zarzi cave in the Zagros foothills of Iraq

PARAGRAPH

In 1928, archaeologist Dorothy Garrod and her team excavated Zarzi cave in Iraq.

This cave was occupied by modern humans during the Epipalaeolithic, a period between the last Ice Age and the warm conditions of the Holocene.

Among the finds from the cave were two small obsidian artifacts.

Obsidian, however, does not naturally occur in Iraq.

Instead, this volcanic glass must have been transported to the cave site by people.

Chemical analysis of these two artifacts, both small blades, reveals that the obsidian originated from Nemrut DaÄŸ volcano in what is now eastern Turkey, more than 650 km on foot.
