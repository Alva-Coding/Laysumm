SECUR-AMA: Active Malware Analysis Based on Monte Carlo Tree Search for Android Systems

PARAGRAPH

Malware analysis is fundamental to create and maintain reliable cyber-security systems capable of countering different threats.

In the context of dynamic analysis, malware often remain hidden until a specific triggering action is performed by the user.

SECUR-AMA is an Active Malware Analysis (AMA) framework for Android that mimics what a security expert does when analyzing a malware: it performs actions on the system, triggering malicious responses to generate a behavioral model of the application.

SECUR-AMA learns from past interactions to guide the analysis aiming at maximizing the information that can be acquired on the malware while minimizing the number of triggering actions.
