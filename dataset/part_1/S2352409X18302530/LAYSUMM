TITLE

Distinguishing stone age drilling techniques on ostrich eggshell beads: An experimental approach

PARAGRAPH

Ostrich eggshell beads first appeared 40-50 thousand years ago in Africa, and represent some of the first evidence for personal ornamentation.

In this article we outline a statistical method for distinguishing ostrich eggshell beads perforated with a hand turned drill bit and those created with a hafted drill.

This distinction has important implications for understanding past bead-making traditions across space and time, and for tracing the first appearance and spread of hafted drilling.

We also define a set of terms which we hope will allow for a more standardized discussion of bead production signatures and techniques.
