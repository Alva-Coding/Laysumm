TITLE

New data about exploitation of the Zayukovo (Baksan) obsidian source in Northern Caucasus during the Paleolithic

PARAGRAPH

Obsidian is a unique raw material exploited in the Paleolithic because it allows to researchers to define distances of raw material transport and inter regional contacts in different periods.

Its chemical composition is unique for each eruptive event.

Numerous sources of obsidian are known in the Southern and Lesser Caucasus, but only one source called Zayukovo (Baksan) is known in the Northern Caucasus.

Doronicheva and co-authors report new data about exploitation of this source during the Palaeolithic.

This is the largest series of Palaeolithic obsidian artefacts ever analyzed for the region.

The research indicates contacts between different regions in the Caucasus in the Middle, Upper and Epipaleolithic.
