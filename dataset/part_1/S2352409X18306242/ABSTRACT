ABSTRACT

TITLE

New data about exploitation of the Zayukovo (Baksan) obsidian source in Northern Caucasus during the Paleolithic

PARAGRAPH

The Zayukovo (Baksan) source is the only obsidian source known in the Northern Caucasus.

We report new data, collected in 2017â€“2018, about exploitation of the Zayukovo (Baksan) source in the Paleolithic, including results of analysis of 34 new samples from Saradj-Chuko grotto, Mezmaiskaya cave, Sosruko rockshelter and Kasojskaya cave.

This is the largest series of obsidian samples ever analyzed for the Northern Caucasus Paleolithic sites.

Obsidian transport long distances indicates hominid mobility and cultural contacts within the Northern Caucasus in the Paleolithic.
