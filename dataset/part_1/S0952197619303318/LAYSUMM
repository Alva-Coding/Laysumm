TITLE

A soft set based VIKOR approach for some decision-making problems under complex neutrosophic environment

PARAGRAPH

In our real-life related decision-making problems, two dimensional neutrosophic information of an alternative with respect to a parameter is often appeared.

Complex neutrosophic soft set theory can handle these problems very easily by using its amplitude part and phase part.

Therefore, in this study, we have proposed a decision-making methodology to solve problems based on complex fuzzy soft sets by using VIKOR method.

Three real-life related problems including, medical diagnosis problem, sustainable manufacturing material selection problem, company's manager selection problem have been discussed and solved to show the aptness of our developed approach.
