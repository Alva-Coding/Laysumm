TITLE

Online learning control with Echo State Networks of an oil production platform

PARAGRAPH

Artificial Intelligence enabled learning models purely from observed data.

This work shows how to learn an optimal control policy for complex dynamic systems in an adaptive real-time fashion.

Specifically, Echo State Networks (ESNs) are used to learn the inverse system model that yields the control input for the current output that drives the system toward a desired state.

The ESN is a recurrent neural network with fast learning by linear methods such as (recursive) least squares.

In an application to oil platforms, the ESN-based controller was shown to learn online the

regulation of variables such as the riser inlet pressure.
