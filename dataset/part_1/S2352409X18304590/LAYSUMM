TITLE

Identifying and sourcing pyrometamorphic artifacts: Clinker in subarctic North America and the hunter-gatherer response to a Late Holocene volcanic eruption

PARAGRAPH

We use a variety of techniques to identify a raw material called Tertiary Hills Clinker that was used to make stone tools for over 10,000 years in northern Canada.

We then match geochemical fingerprints of artifacts and source outcrop materials to demonstrate that Tertiary Hills Clinker was exchanged over an area of 1.25 million kmÂ².

The way that people utilized Tertiary Hills Clinker changed after a large-scale volcanic eruption about 1200 years ago.

We argue that the volcanic ash and its ecological impact fragmented pre-contact relationships, which may have stimulated one of the largest migrations of hunter-gatherers in North America.
