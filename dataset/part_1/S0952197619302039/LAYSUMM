TITLE

Hybrid structures in time series modeling and forecasting: A review

PARAGRAPH

The key factor in selecting appropriate forecasting model is accuracy.

Given the deficiencies of single models in processing various patterns latent in data, hybrid approaches have been known as promising techniques to achieve more accurate results.

The main goal of this paper is to analyze hybrid structures by surveying more than 150 papers employed various hybrid models in time series modeling and forecasting domains.

In this paper, the classification of hybrid models is made based on three main combination structures: parallel, series, and parallel-series.

Then, reviewed papers are analyzed comprehensively with respect to their specific features of employed hybrid structure
