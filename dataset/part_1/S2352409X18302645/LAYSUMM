TITLE

A comparison of automated object extraction methods for mound and shell-ring identification in coastal South Carolina

PARAGRAPH

While LiDAR has proven to provide detailed topographic information in heavily forested environments, tools for efficiently processing these data are needed.

Machine learning algorithms offer a means of systematically isolating features that have topographic signatures consistent with archaeological deposits.

We compare four methods for automated identification of archaeological earthwork structures (i.e., mounds and rings) from LiDAR datasets.

Our findings show that a combination of algorithms that combine aspects of size and shape profiles with statistical correlations are the most successful in identifying archaeological deposits that also minimize the incidence of false positives.
