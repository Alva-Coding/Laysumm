TITLE

Impairment of consciousness induced by bilateral electrical stimulation of the frontal convexity

PARAGRAPH

Although consciousness is commonly impaired in epileptic seizures, limited literature is available on loss of consciousness induced by electrical cortical stimulation (ECS) in humans undergoing intracranial EEG evaluations for localization of epileptic focus.

One theory advocates the presence of consciousness ‘switch’ in subcortical structures.

While this model is novel and simplistic, it has its inherent limitations.

In this case study, we propose an alternative approach on the entity and discuss the complex circuits underlying it and correlate that with the electrophysiological findings and the pathophysiology of the phenotype of the disease and discuss potential causes for rarity of reports on the subject.
