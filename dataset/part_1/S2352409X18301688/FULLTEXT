TITLE

Monte do Carrascal 2 (southern Portugal): Insights into lithic technology and intra-site spatial analysis of a Late Mesolithic hunting camp

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

The Late Mesolithic settlement (ca. 6200–5600 cal BC) of western Iberia is best known through the shell middens complexes located in the Tagus (Roche, 1989; Bicho et al., 2017, 2013, 2010; Gonçalves, 2013; Gonçalves et al., 2017) and Sado rivers basins (Arias et al., 2015; Diniz and Arias, 2012) and in the coastal areas surrounding the Cape Saint Vincent (Carvalho and Valente, 2005), as well as some sites located in the Mira river valley and southwest coast (Arnaud, 1994; Lubell et al., 2007).

The occupation of these regions during Late Mesolithic, with particular relevance to Sado and Muge valleys, is thought to be related to the coastal and estuarine transformations (Zilhão, 2003; Bicho et al., 2010) resulting from the 8.2 ka cold event (Alley and Agustsdottir, 2005; Alley et al., 1993).

PARAGRAPH

In the Sado valley, settlement consists exclusively of shell middens, in a total of 12 sites (Arias et al., 2015, 2016; Arnaud, 1989; Diniz and Arias, 2012), located mainly around the main river margins.

Sado's shell middens are very different from the ones identified in Muge in terms of their visual impact on the landscape since they are not true mounds but rather shell layers interbedded in the local sandy deposits.

They do present, however, the same range of archaeological attributes, including (1) habitat features such as pits and hearths; (2) a wide range of lithic materials, with particular emphasis for geometric microliths; (3) a diverse component of fauna, which includes shellfish (Scrobicularia plana and Cerastoderma edule), but also fish remains, and medium/small-sized mammals; (4) botanical remains and charcoal (Arias et al., 2016); (5) an important funerary component, with large numbers of human burials (Cunha and Umbelino, 2001; Peyroteo Stjerna, 2016).

PARAGRAPH

The functional role of the Sado and Muge sites has been frequently debated based on recent data, but there's still a gap in the knowledge about how these communities experienced the inland territory.

Since the known sites in southern Portugal are mainly open-air and bear an important shell component, Carrascal 2 becomes a singular case, given its inland location that is close to Sado river shell middens but does not comprise a shell component.

The importance of this site is not only related to its landscape location but also because it has a set of relatively well-preserved features and a lithic remains distribution that points to anthropic accumulations.

PARAGRAPH

Data from this site provides new insights, amplifying the known territory exploited by these communities and allowing the debate on territorial exploitation strategies (namely, in what concerns lithic raw materials acquisition), for a phase in which the mesolithic way of life is about to end with the Neolithic advent in the Portuguese territory.

PARAGRAPH

Through the techno-typological analysis of the lithic industry, associated with its spatial distribution, we intend to access the site's functionality, integrating it in the settlement models available for the Southern Portugal Mesolithic.

SECTION

The Carrascal site

PARAGRAPH

Monte do Carrascal 2 site is located in southwestern Iberia (Portugal) (Valera et al. 2014), in the plain interior area of the Alentejo region in Beja district (Ferreira do Alentejo municipality), on a smooth slope over the stream of Vale do Ouro (X = 202055,59; Y = 123193,97 – coordinates system Hayford Gauss, Datum 73), 25 km east of the Sado river shell middens (Fig. 1).

PARAGRAPH

Geologically, it is located in the “Maciço de Beja”, on the “Gabros de Beja” area.

The municipality of Ferreira do Alentejo is formed by three geological unities: “Zona de Ossa-Morena”, “Zona Sul Portuguesa” and “Bacia do Sado”.

Lithologically it is mostly formed by sedimentary formations (sands, sandstones, gravels, marls, clays and conglomerates), eruptive rocks (gabbros, quartziferous porphyries), and sedimentary and metamorphic rocks (claysh schists, amphibolites, and metavulcanits).

In the “Zona de Ossa Morena” gabbro-diorites, porphyries, basalt and acidic rocks occur.

The site is located near the transition area between the sedimentary and metamorphic formations and eruptive plutonic rocks1 (Percurso Consultores, 2010; Carta Geológica de Portugal, Folha 8, 1992), but laying over the first.

PARAGRAPH

During the opening of a watering conduct of Ferreira, the discovery of a set of Chalcolithic negative features, through preventive archaeological works, led to archaeological surveys on the project's impact area done by Era Arqueologia S.A. company (Valera et al., 2014).

PARAGRAPH

Monte do Carrascal 2 site is composed of a set of Chalcolithic negative features (a ditch, hypogea and possibly tholoi), that disturbed and cut part of the mesolithic occupation.

The subsequent identification of the mesolithic layers (especially a large number of lithic materials) led to a change in the excavation's methodology (implantation of a grid, excavation of the sediment by removing 5 cm thick artificial levels, coordination of every material and the sieving of all the sediment).

PARAGRAPH

The mesolithic occupation of the site was identified only in survey 14 (ca. 38 m2) (Fig. 2A and B), made larger afterwards.

The excavated context had about 11 m length and 3,5 m width (only the area affected by the watering conduct).

Over a sub-oval or sub-circular depression in the bedrock, probably with natural origin, very irregular on base and in the North and South sides (Stratigraphic Unit 1429), was deposited a sediment (Stratigraphic Unit 1410) of greyish/whitish colour and sandy-clayish texture, with calcrete inclusions and about 25–30 cm thick (Fig. 2C).

PARAGRAPH

The archaeological materials that integrated this deposit were mainly lithic remains attributed to the Mesolithic period.

Apart from these, some pottery fragments were recovered probably as a result of the disturbance caused by the formation of the Chalcolithic strata.

PARAGRAPH

Two possible hearths were identified on this site: one on the South and the other on North side of the survey (Figs. 3 and 4).

Stratigraphic Unit (S.U.) 1417 located on the South side, comprises a set of faunal material (two aurochs horns and metapodials, as well as vertebrae and other elements, mostly burnt).

Even though the sediment S.U. 1418 involves this feature it did not show any traces of combustion, although some fire-cracked rocks were identified (Fig. 3A).

The second identified feature S.U.1432, located North, presented a slightly smaller quantity of equally burnt bones and lithic material (Fig. 3B).

PARAGRAPH

For the site of Carrascal, a radiocarbon date was obtained, based on a sample of Bos primigenius.

(Beta-339603), from the feature S.U. 1417.

The date 5713–5620 cal BC (95%), makes the site of Carrascal contemporary of the occupations of mesolithic shell middens of the Sado valley (Fig. 5 and Table A.1).

Lithics techno-typological analysis

SECTION

Methodology

PARAGRAPH

The methodology used follows the criteria for the techno-typological analysis proposed by G.E.E.M. (1969), Tixier et al. (1980), Zilhão (1997), Carvalho (1998, 2008) and Inizan et al. (1999).

For this study, we selected the materials from the stratigraphic units that could securely be attributed to the Mesolithic period by both the techno-typological and stratigraphic analysis.

Nevertheless, some of the materials that could be ascribed to Mesolithic recovered on the Chalcolithic levels were also included in the techno-typological analysis.

SECTION

General characterization

PARAGRAPH

An overview of the technological categories reveals that the present sample is formed, mainly, by debris (36,74%), debitage products (33,43%) followed by undetermined fragments of knapping (i.e. fragments of knapping categories that we could not attribute a precise classification- e.g. flakes, bladelets) (11,88%), tools (10,77%) and cores (4,70%) (Table 1).

The rest of the categories (preparation and resharpening materials and scaled piece) have residual percentages inside the group.

PARAGRAPH

Regarding debitage products, flakes and bladelets have a similar representativeness (flakes – 17,40% and bladelets – 16,02%).

Tools are specially characterized by lateral retouches (made on flakes, bladelets and blades), and elements with traces of use (a posteriori tools).

Debris is the best-represented category and includes mainly uncharacteristic fragments (34,81%), but also 4 chips (1,10%) and 3 microburins (0,83%).

Finally, 8 pieces with cortex (preparation and resharpening materials) were identified.

Apart from these elements, the set from Carrascal 2 also includes other categories of materials (8 pebbles (manuports), 51 fragments of unknapped rocks, 4 fire-cracked rocks and a tested pebble).

SECTION

Raw materials acquisition

PARAGRAPH

At the site of Carrascal 2, the presence of a varied group of raw materials types was denoted, which can be broadly divided into siliceous and non-siliceous rocks.

An overall observation of the frequency of each raw material type reveals that quartz is the most frequent type in all the collection (Table 1).

The second most used type is the siliceous rocks group (this group includes some siliceous types that could not be precisely identified, which may include some varieties of chert and other regional rocks).

Even though the chert, the jasper and the flint could be included in the siliceous materials group, we were able to distinguish them apart.

The third most used rock is chert, followed by flint, quartzite, and jasper.

We also registered the presence of porphyry, hyaline quartz, some carbonated rocks, schist, and some mineral rocks (not knapped).

All the previously mentioned rocks are locally available, except flint.

PARAGRAPH

Most quartz presents a white colour (translucent) with some rose, orange, and greyish tones, present in the form of small pebbles.

The siliceous rocks including cherts and jaspers rarely present traces of cortex (only found in 7 exemplars), but when present it is rolled or pebble cortex.

The exemplars with cortex are blanks and tools.

PARAGRAPH

Knapping on the site of siliceous and non-siliceous raw materials was attested by the presence of cores, preparation and resharpening and waste materials, even though the presence of chips is lower compared to fragments, what could point to knapping in other area on the site, or to the first stages of the knapping near the raw material source.

PARAGRAPH

Quartz is the raw material that presents the largest presence of cortex, even though the numbers are very low: absence of cortex (79,81%); vestigial (7,79%); semi-cortical (1,37%,) and cortical (6,88%).

Only one first flake (0,45%) was identified.

PARAGRAPH

As for the porphyries and quartzites, the presence of cortex is vestigial (3 exemplars in both porphyry and quartzite).

PARAGRAPH

As mentioned before, the flint present in this assemblage has an exogenous origin.

There are two possible explanations for the presence of flint tools in Carrascal 2, which include geometric microliths, a retouched blade, a bladelet, a flake and a posteriori tools (pieces with macroscopically identified possible traces of use).

Either these artefacts were fabricated elsewhere, or they were fabricated at the site, as the presence of two flint cores seems to imply.

Both scenarios could have happened simultaneously, although current data does not allow for a definitive answer.

The evidence of flint knapping in Carrascal 2, though, is very scarce since we have no flint waste materials and only two cores, one piece with cortex, two bladelets, and seven tools.

PARAGRAPH

In Table 1 the distribution of the raw materials according to the technological categories can be observed.

On the cores group it seems there's no particular highlighted raw material.

The debitage products and the debris are made mainly of quartz, followed by the siliceous rock group.

Preparation and resharpening materials are dominated by quartz.

The tools group does not present representative clusters unless we group the siliceous rocks with the cherts, jaspers and flints.

SECTION

Cores and preparation and resharpening materials

PARAGRAPH

In Carrascal, a total of 17 cores and 8 possible fragments of cores were identified (Fig. 6).

From this assemblage, 10 were intact and 7 were fractured.

The non-siliceous rocks cores (white quartzes and porphyries), present, most of them, traces of cortex (vestigial n = 4 and semi-cortical n = 2; cortical n = 1; absent cortex n = 3).

Of the siliceous rocks cores, only 2 present vestigial remains cortex.

The analysis of core attributes has allowed the distinction of two different knapping purposes that will be discussed in Section 3.7.

PARAGRAPH

The siliceous rocks set is composed of 7 exemplars.

In the siliceous rocks group, it was not possible to distinguish a predominant type of core (informal cores n = 2, prismatic n = 2, globular n = 1).

As for the direction of the extractions, they were bidirectional, both crossed and opposed (n = 4), and unidirectional (n = 3).

As for the platform typology, some were faceted (n = 4), others flat (n = 2), from which bladelets (n = 2), bladelets and flakes (n = 2), and chips (n = 2) were extracted.

The dimensions of these materials (Tables A.2 and A.3) were relatively small indicating either the small dimension of the available pebbles in the region or the intensive exploitation of the blanks available.

Two flint cores were identified, one of them presenting pebble cortex.

PARAGRAPH

The assemblage of non-siliceous rocks (white quartz, porphyry, quartzite and undetermined elements) points to equally typological representativeness: globular (n = 2), discoidal (n = 1), informal (n = 2), crossed and opposed, with flat platforms (n = 3) and facetted (n = 3).

PARAGRAPH

The preparation and resharpening material category is composed only of pieces with remains of cortex, mainly in white quartz (one of them is a first flake).

SECTION

Debitage products

PARAGRAPH

Debitage products are the second most well-represented category (Table 1 and Figs. 6 and 7).

In this group, the frequency of flakes and bladelets is not significant, even though flakes are slightly more numerous (flakes – 52%, bladelets – 48%).

Bladelets (including tools) are mostly fractured, with only 9 complete records.

Three cases of fracture by flexion were registered.

In this category elements with cortex remains are scarce.

Complete unretouched bladelets show an average length of 17,78 mm, 7,6 mm of width and 3,14 mm of thickness (Table A.4).

PARAGRAPH

When compared the average length size on bladelets from sites with similar chronologies in the Sado (Arapouco, Amoreiras and Poças de S. Bento shell middens) and Mira valley (Fiais shell midden) (Table A.4), we conclude that the complete and unretouched bladelets are shorter in Carrascal 2 although the maximum difference does not surpass ca. 5 mm (Araújo, 1995–1997; Lubell et al., 2007; Marchand, 2001; Nukushina, 2012; Diniz and Nukushina 2014).

Nonetheless, these results must be analysed with caution since, for Carrascal 2, only 9 complete bladelets were recovered.

Nonetheless, these results must be analysed with caution since, for Carrascal 2, only 9 complete bladelets were recovered.

PARAGRAPH

On what concerns bladelets attributes, we could observe that in the proximal part they showed mostly flat butts (57,10%), no lip (97,62%), no evidence of abrasion, little-pronounced bulbs ((diffuse 53,7%), no bulb (24,4%)), and no bulb scars (71%).

The sections were mainly triangular (56,3%) and trapezoidal (37,5%).

The edges were mostly parallel, the profiles were straight (66,67%), and without visible percussion ripples (95%).

The overall percentage of regular pronounced arris is low (28,95%).

PARAGRAPH

The assemblage of flakes (including tools) is formed mainly by white quartz, generally with no cortical remains, with a percentage of complete elements higher (56,41%) then the fractured ones.

The average dimensions are relatively reduced (length – 17,99 mm; width – 16,39 mm; thickness – 5,04 mm), and other authors (Araújo 1995–1997) might even consider them as debris (<20 mm length).

PARAGRAPH

The flakes present, essentially, flat butts (50%), edges with varied morphologies (convergent – 29,5%; divergent – 29,5%; and parallels – 27,3%), triangular (36,8%), trapezoidal (23,7%) and flat (23,7%) sections, different morphologies of bulbs, without bulb scars (87,5%), no lip (94,3%), no abrasion (97,2%), straight profiles (79,6%), straight proximal and distal profiles (respectively 81,7% and 84,9%) and no visible ripples (90,8%).

PARAGRAPH

The length dimension of the flakes in Carrascal 2 is shorter than the one from Sado shell middens (Table A.5).

SECTION

Tools

PARAGRAPH

Tools are the third most represented category (n = 39) if the undetermined knapped fragments are not considered (Table 1, Figs. 6 and 7).

They comprise common tools (lateral retouch on flakes, notches, denticulates, endscrapers and sidescrapers) and retouched bladelets and blades.

The low representation of geometric microliths (2 triangles and 1 trapeze) must be highlighted.

The existence of some a posteriori tools and some retouches on non-standardized supports was also recorded (Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

The group of retouched bladelets and blades has an overall representativeness of 20% (6 bladelets with mostly short, direct and inverse, regular, abrupt and semi-abrupt retouches).

Two fragments of blade with lateral retouch (short, direct, regular, and semi-abrupt retouches) were considered as, possibly, being assignable to the Chalcolithic occupations.

The retouched flakes, made, mostly, on quartz, are the most represented tool (28%).

PARAGRAPH

The small group of geometric microliths includes two isosceles triangles on flint and an asymmetric trapeze on chert.

They are mainly pieces with no traces of cortex, made from bladelets, with straight and concave profiles.

These elements are fabricated through the application of abrupt, direct, rectilinear, and short retouch.

Two of the exemplars show traces of use (one scar on the widest side and possible impact fractures in one extremity).

The geometric fabrication using microburin technique is attested by the presence of three microburins in siliceous rocks, consisting of a distal part and two proximal parts of a bladelet.

PARAGRAPH

A posteriori tools category is formed by 6 bladelets, a quartz flake, and a blade, with macroscopic traces of use.

Amongst the group of bladelets, the traces of use are located on the left edge (n = 4) and in both edges (n = 2), with partial (n = 4) and discontinuous (n = 2) repartitions.

They present, mostly, elements with no cortex, parallel edges, triangular and trapezoidal sections, diffuse bulb, with no lips or abrasion, and without visible ripples.

PARAGRAPH

The frequency of raw materials by type of tool shows that the elongated supports are made mostly of siliceous rocks (including cherts, jaspers and flint).

The fine grain siliceous rocks allow for better control in the knapping process.

The quartz is used mainly for the production of tools on flakes support, as was verified in the debitage products.

SECTION

Strategies and rocks: discussion

PARAGRAPH

On this assemblage, all phases of the châine operatoire were identified.

The proportions of the categories present attest for the practice of knapping on the site, using mainly local raw materials, such as quartz (n = 92; 84,4%), where the presence of cortex is almost non-existent.

PARAGRAPH

Distinguishing a preferred knapping technique (Binder, 1987; Binder et al., 2012; Inizan et al., 1999; Pelegrin, 1984; Tixier, 1984) for Carrascal 2 is problematic, even though some data points to the use of pressure and indirect percussion.

Still, it is very hard to distinguish between these two in most of the cases.

For bladelets extraction, the curve distal profiles (52,63%), parallel edges (70%), invisible ripples (95%) may suggest the use of pressure.

On the other hand, high frequency of flat butts (57,1%) and the diffuse bulbs (53,7%) may suggest the use of indirect percussion.

PARAGRAPH

Thus, the existence of two different strategies concerning the knapping goals was verified, on what concerns the choice of raw materials.

If, on one hand, the debitage of elongated blanks is done, essentially, by using siliceous rocks, given that the inner characteristics of the raw material allow a more efficient knapping, on the other hand, the production of flakes is done mainly on quartz.

The use of porphyry is preferred to produce flakes since its grain would not be favourable to the production of elongated blanks.

PARAGRAPH

As for the level of representativeness of the debitage products and tools, the observations done for the Carrascal 2 site are slightly different than the ones verified, for some of the same contemporaneous and geographically nearby sites.

At Carrascal 2, flakes are predominant in the assemblage (65,22%), as they are at Cabeço do Rebolador, Várzea da Mó (Marchand, 2001) and Arapouco (Diniz and Nukushina, 2014).

In the case of Amoreiras shell midden (Nukushina, 2012) and Poças de São Bento (Araújo, 1995–1997), the bladelets predominate within the debitage products.

PARAGRAPH

If the dimensions of the unretouched flakes at Carrascal and the ones used as tools are compared it can be observed that the bigger sized flake supports were selected for tool production (tools width: 21,03 mm; debited products width: 16,39 mm).

PARAGRAPH

On what concerns tools, the predominance of geometrics is frequent in the Sado shell middens, even though they present intra-site/inter-site stratigraphic variations (Amoreiras, 52,79%) (Nukushina, 2012).

In Arapouco, this category is dominated by the common tools (37,39%) and retouched bladelets (2,80%) (Diniz and Nukushina, 2014).

PARAGRAPH

In the Sado shell middens, the acquisition of locally available raw materials, mainly siliceous rocks, seems to be the preponderant strategy.

In the case of Arapouco, the predominant presence of siliceous raw materials can “reflect the intensive acquiring of lithic resources locally available, more than a search for the adequacy of the qualities of raw materials regarding the final products” (Diniz and Nukushina, 2014: 36 [translation of the author]).

PARAGRAPH

In Carrascal 2 is also evident the preference for the use of local raw materials (quartz and siliceous rocks), even though an exogenous raw material (flint) is present, thus indicating the mobility of these communities.

SECTION

Intra-site spatial organization

SECTION

Methodology

PARAGRAPH

The stratigraphic units considered for the spatial analysis, mostly [1410], with a thickness of about 25 cm, were grouped, for there is no guaranty that they represent different phases of occupation, but probably slightly different processes of sedimentation and taphonomic activity.

PARAGRAPH

To detect if there's a discernible spatial organization of the features in this site, we conducted GIS tests, to identify, in the first place, if there are distribution patterns that we can observe.

Using ArcGIS 10.5 software we conducted three spatial tests: (1) Kernel Density Estimate (KDE); (2) Nearest Neighbour Analysis; and (3) Ripley's K Function test.

These tests have demonstrated to be the adequate approach to visually explore the spatial variation and identify the areas with a higher density of archaeological artefacts (e.g., Baxter et al., 1997; Bevan et al., 2013; Blasco et al., 2016).

PARAGRAPH

KDE is a statistical non-parametric method that allows the identification, for each observation, of the number and disposition of the elements (in this case, lithics) that occur in a previously established radius.

Radius determination (bandwidth), according to several authors (e.g., Bailey and Gatrell, 1995; Baxter, 2003; Baxter et al., 1997; Conolly and Lake, 2006; Herzog, 2007), should be performed in an interactive way, comparing the KDE surface with the original distribution of the points.

Nevertheless, to minimize the error determination of the KDE value on the influence radius we used the K Ripley's function.

With this function a radius value is obtained, based on the assumption that the value of the scale that represents the maximum clustering of the events establishes the size of the ideal radius to identify statistically relevant patterns (Charpentier and Gallic, 2014; Gonçalves et al., 2017; Thacher et al., 2017).

PARAGRAPH

The simple observation of the density maps does not allow to test, in a statistically valid way, the type of distribution (i.e random, clustered, dispersed), for that, we performed the Nearest Neighbour Analysis.

The Nearest Neighbor Statistical method looks at observed and expected average distances, if the ratio of points expected is between 0 and 1, then it can be assumed that the points are of a clustered distribution (Clark and Evans, 1954; Conolly and Lake, 2006).

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

The KDE tests present areas with higher densities of artefacts on the central area and South part of the survey.

This is due to the disturbance that happened at the site during the building of the Chalcolithic tholos in the northern part of the excavated area.

In the mesolithic strata, some areas with higher density of lithic artefacts could be observed on the central Eastern part.

PARAGRAPH

“All artefacts” category (that includes all the technological categories presented in Table 1, Fig. 8), seems to be clustered, as we can observe on Ripley's K Function (Fig. 9) and Nearest Neighbour (NN), with a Z-Score of −34,149.

There is <1% likelihood that this clustered pattern could be the result of “random chance”.

PARAGRAPH

The debitage products are clustered on both tests - Nearest Neighbour, with a Z-Score of −6.086 and K Ripley's Function.

There is <1% likelihood that this clustered pattern could be the result of “random chance”.

KDE shows a higher density on feature [1417].

PARAGRAPH

The other categories appear to be dispersed in the same pattern as the tools.

PARAGRAPH

KDE for the tools category shows some density on the central area and on feature [1417], thus should be noted that the registered material densities area is not statistically significant to be considered a concentration.

PARAGRAPH

On KDE, the fire-cracked category and pebbles appear to be located on both fireplaces, even though its higher density areas do not correspond to any of the features.

The values for the densities of the fire-cracked rocks is extremely low 2,2982 (Fig. A.8), even though visually there seems to be a concentration.

This is supported by the NN values.

The cores category show two points of density on central area and on feature [1417], evidenced on the KDE map.

Finally, the debris, based on the KDE, seem to be distributed throughout all the area, with some density peaks on the central and south areas.

Monte do Carrascal 2: a mesolithic site in the context of southern mesolithic settlement network

PARAGRAPH

The available data for this site suggests that we are, possibly, in the presence of a hunting site, with local knapping, and features (possible hearths), where animals were processed and eaten, indicating hunting practices in this region.

The presence of this type of features, in association with the lithic industry, does not provide clear indicators on the time length of this occupation.

The lithic industry here analysed corresponds only to a fraction of an undetermined total area, since the site was not fully excavated, nor were its real limits identified.

Therefore, these contingencies do not allow for a clear understanding of the functionality of the site.

PARAGRAPH

The spatial analysis data points to the dispersed pattern of most of the categories, and to the clustering of debitage products.

Some areas present a higher density of materials, such as the area around the southernmost hearth.

This hearth seems to have gathered people to perform activities such as knapping and animal processing since it includes aurochs remains in it and lithic artefacts around it.

PARAGRAPH

Even though the practice of hunting is suggested, the presence of geometrics in the collection is not significant amongst the tools, as the flakes and bladelets are.

A possible explanation for this could be the fact that geometrics could get lost during hunting practices if used as projectiles.

PARAGRAPH

The geographic location of Carrascal 2 is uncommon if we observe the bigger picture of Late Mesolithic settlement in South Portugal.

For this area and chronological phase, settlements are located on river valleys (Sado and Mira rivers) and in the coastal region and are mainly shell middens.

The case of Carrascal 2, located in a flat inland landscape reveals the amplitude of the territory explored by these communities.

For the Sado area, models of logistic exploitation of the territory were suggested (Arnaud, 1989, 2000; Marchand, 2001), that integrated base-camps and temporary-camps, and thus, some of the shell middens may have had specialized economic activities.

In this area, the presence of a big range of identified species attests the exploitation of coastal, estuarine and terrestrial environments, even though the data seem to point to distinct realities amongst this group of sites, in what concerns dietary components (Peyroteo Stjerna 2016), and consequently of the paleo-landscapes (Diniz and Arias, 2012).

Situated 25 km Southeast from the group of the Sado shell middens, the Carrascal site could attest the mobility of these groups inland in the Winter, with incursions into the territory for activities such as hunting (Fig. 1).

This possibility is further supported by the discovery of other generically contemporary sites.

A Late Mesolithic/Early Neolithic chronology has been recently suggested for Barranco Horta do Almada 1 site, located near the town of Beja (Santa Clara do Louredo), based in the typologies of the lithic materials.

This site is composed of a set of around 45 ovens (negative features with burnt clay coating the inside walls) and some depressions (possible oven projects) (Rosa and Diniz, 2017).

Also, in the interior regions of this territory, two more sites, Defesa de Cima 2 (Diniz, 2017) and Xarez 12 (Gonçalves et al., 2013), both in Évora district were identified.

The Defesa de Cima 2 site is ascribed to the transition phase between Early Mesolithic/Late Mesolithic transition (6075–6005 cal2σ, BC-Beta-409413) indicating, yet again, the presence of hunters in the interior, with the identification of clay features-oven/storage pits in the site.

Also, the site of Xarez 12 (Gonçalves et al., 2013), is composed by a set of clay features, with no radiocarbon date, but with occupations possibly attributed to Mesolithic and Neolithic.

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

Until very recently there was a total lack of knowledge regarding Late Mesolithic sites in this interior region of Alentejo.

The increasing number of impact mitigation archaeological excavations in the area has helped to change this general picture, revealing important sites as the ones mentioned above (Carrascal 2, Barranco Horta do Almada 1, Defesa de Cima 2 and Xarez 12) that contribute to re-shape the settlement pattern and land management strategies for Mesolithic populations in South Portugal.

PARAGRAPH

Carrascal 2, due to its relative proximity to the Sado shell middens, suggests the existence of a diversified and complementary strategy of territorial and resource exploitation by these communities, and provides new insights about the extensions of those territories regarding the interior of Alentejo, underlining the role of the larger river basins (in this case the Sado basin) in the access to those inland areas.
