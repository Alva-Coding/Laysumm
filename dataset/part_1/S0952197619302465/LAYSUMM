ElHealth: Using Internet of Things and data prediction for elastic management of human resources in smart hospitals

PARAGRAPH

One of the major challenges faced in hospitals refers to the increasingly overcrowded patients' queues, which contribute to a potential deterioration of patients' health conditions.

One of the reasons of such an inefficiency is a poor allocation of health professionals.

In this work, we introduce ElHealth, an IoT-focused model able to monitor patients' usage of hospital rooms and, employing data prediction techniques to anticipate when the demand of a given room will exceeds its capacity, to propose actions to allocate health professionals so as to meet patients needs.

ElHealth obtained promising results, decreasing the waiting time by up to 96.71%.
