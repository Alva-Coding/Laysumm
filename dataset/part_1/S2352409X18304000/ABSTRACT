ABSTRACT

TITLE

New insights on the chronology of medieval mining activity in the small polymetallic district of Faravel (Massif des Ã‰crins, Southern French Alps) derived from dendrochronological and archaeological approaches

PARAGRAPH

A large amount of well-preserved timbers was found during several archaeological excavations of the Faravel mining site (Southern French Alps, between 1950- and 2150 m a.s.l.).

232 of these timbers were sampled for dendrochronological analysis and 67% of them were dated.

These 156 larch (Larix decidua Mill.)

series, crossdated against existing reference chronologies, were averaged for a site chronology spanning from 777 to 1243.

From this dataset, 33 timbers with (almost) complete sapwood allowed us to obtain tree felling years with seasonal resolution.

The chronological distribution of these felling years highlights nine distinct mining phases that occurred between 1059 and 1243, revealing a discontinuous exploitation of the study site during the medieval period.

In addition, the presence of late wood in the vast majority of complete samples, demonstrates that logging mainly occurred during late fall and early winter.

These results, combined with historical, palynological and archaeological investigations, plead for short, seasonal, and low-intensity, mining campaigns, mainly carried out after the bulk of agropastoral activities using rudimentary techniques with limited impact on the forest cover.
