TITLE

Train of four stimulation artifact mimicking a seizure during computerized automated ICU EEG monitoring

PARAGRAPH

To monitor the effect of muscle relaxant drugs in critically ill patients, we stimulate the muscle in rapid four sequence of electric impulse (Train of Four [TOF]), which makes the muscle twitch.

Typical sites for TOF stimulation are the wrist, leg or facial nerve.

We found electrical disturbance on electrode recording of brain activity through an advanced EEG software which captured the characteristic TOF neurostimulation pattern at the facial nerve location, but was mistakenly thought to be a seizure pattern.

This case provides a unique ICU EEG artifact, helpful for nursing and ICU providers.
