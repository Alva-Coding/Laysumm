TITLE

Scaling up: Stable isotope evidence for the intensification of animal husbandry in Bronze-Iron Age Lika, Croatia

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

The European Late Bronze Age was characterized by the rapid reorganization of social, political, and economic lifeways, resulting in larger and denser populations, new regional centers, and expanded trade networks that demanded increased economic specialization to sustain them.

The intensification and diversification of agricultural and husbandry practices throughout Europe was one result of these new systems, and was carried out through the production of more durable tools from technological advancements in metal-working; development of intensive practices such as plowing, manuring, and irrigation; and the introduction of either new domesticates or management techniques that increased the productivity of old ones (Harding, 2002; Kristiansen and Larsson, 2005; Stevens and Fuller, 2012; Reed, 2013).

Groups did not uniformly adopt these new changes, however, but instead engaged in complex decision-making processes that evaluated the potential benefits of new technologies and systems against perceived hazards and local environmental constraints.

In more marginal environments with limited resources, these calculations were especially important.

People, plants, and animals all require land for settlement, cultivation, and pasture, and expanding communities faced balancing these competing interests in ways that maximized yields without sacrificing efficiency or value (Allaby et al., 2015; Banks et al., 2013; Zavodny et al., 2017).

PARAGRAPH

Using the Lika region of central Croatia as a case study, we explore how prehistoric groups approached these delicate negotiations and successfully intensified production in poor environments.

Lika is a mountainous region situated between the Adriatic coast and central Croatian plains (Fig. 1).

Its challenging environment and topography make agriculture and livestock keeping difficult even today, and similar conditions in the past likely motivated the development of specialized subsistence strategies to support the aggregation of populations around new hillfort centers at the start of the Late Bronze Age (Drechsler-Bižić, 1987).

Here we present new stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values for domesticated and wild fauna to assess the possible diversification and intensification of animal management practices in response to these changing conditions throughout the Middle Bronze (1600–1200 BCE), Late Bronze (1200–800 BCE) and Iron (800–0 BCE) Ages.

Lika in environmental and archaeological context

PARAGRAPH

The Lika region of modern-day Croatia is geographically isolated from the Adriatic coast and continental interior by a series of mountain ranges, including the Dinaric Alps.

These ranges also divide the landscape into a series of interconnected valleys or polja, the largest of which are Gacka to the north and Ličko in the south (Fig. 1).

The Ogulinsko-Plaščanska valley, technically separated from Lika proper by the Velika and Mala Kapela mountain ranges in the northeast, is similar in environment and often included in discussions of Lika's regional history because of perceived parallels in cultural development.

The entire area has an Alpine environment and climate, with a seasonal pattern of short summers, long unpredictable winters, and sudden frosts (Bognar, 2006).

Annual precipitation levels are high, often causing the Gacka and Lika Rivers to temporarily overflow their banks and flood the surrounding valleys (Miko et al., 2000).

This water drains quickly through the limestone substrate leaving behind eroded and nutrient-poor soils (Forenbaher, 1996; Miko et al., 2000).

In modern and historical times, communities counteracted these unfavorable conditions by cultivating high-yield and low-input crops with shortened growing seasons, like spelt and millet (T. Kolak pers.

comm.).

Indigenous breeds of livestock were particularly well adapted to the region's sparse conditions.

For instance, buša cattle can be left outdoors year-round to browse on sub-optimal vegetation with little oversight (Ramljak et al., 2011; Todorović, 2013).

Livestock herds were also moved seasonally to summer pastures in the mountains where more graze was available (Forenbaher, 1996, 2011; Todorović, 2013).

It is unclear, however, when these adaptations developed.

PARAGRAPH

A survey of known archaeological sites suggests Lika possessed a relatively empty landscape throughout much of prehistory.

Caves on either side of the Velebit confirm only sporadic and temporary human occupation beginning in the Neolithic (Drechsler-Bižić, 1970, 1984; Forenbaher, 1987, 1991).

To date, only one Neolithic open-air settlement has been identified (Forenbaher and Vujnović, 2013).

The ensuing Chalcolithic (ca. 4000–2300 BCE) and Early (ca. 2300–1600 BCE) and Middle Bronze Ages (ca. 1600–1200 BCE) are similarly ephemeral, though small ceramic finds demonstrate the continued use of caves (Čović, 1983; Drechsler-Bižić, 1982; Drechsler-Bižić and Balen, 1983).

Burial activity is documented at Bezdanjača, a cave in Gacka valley where over 200 individuals were inhumed between the Middle and early Late Bronze Ages (Drechsler-Bižić, 1980).

In neighboring Ličko valley, a small number of earthen and stone tumuli are presumed to date to the Middle Bronze Age as well (Drechsler-Bižić, 1975a, 1983; Olujić, 2002).

No hillforts have been assigned to this period until very recently, when human remains from Veliki Vital of Gacka valley were dated to 1420–1210 cal BCE (Zavodny and Bakarić, 2017; Zavodny, 2017).

PARAGRAPH

It remains unclear if this sparse archaeological record for most of prehistory is the result of truly small-scale human occupation of Lika or poor preservation of earlier material, but the Late Bronze Age (1200–800 BCE) brings an undeniable change in human activity and landscape modification.

Hillforts rapidly proliferate on the landscape (Bakarić, 2006; Buršić-Matijašic, 2008), and their proximity to mountain passes and river access points suggests the need for defense or control of resources (Šarić, 2004).

Current archaeological interpretation suggests that the largest hillforts in each valley acted as a centralizing force for nearby smaller forts and settlements (Bakarić, 2006; Buršić-Matijašic, 2008).

The end of the Bronze Age is also marked by a dramatic change in regional burial practices from inhumations in stone tumuli and caves to burials in large communal necropoli close to hillforts (Drechsler-Bižić, 1987; Olujić, 2007).

The accumulation of Baltic amber in graves further highlights changing sociopolitical and economic forces in Lika, as well as the beginning of participation in continent-wide trade networks (Bakarić, 2006).

This reorganization of sociopolitical and economic structures is considered the beginning of an integrative regional culture known as the Iapodians (Bakarić, 2006; Drechsler-Bižić, 1987; Olujić, 2007) that existed until Roman conquest ca. 35 BCE.

PARAGRAPH

These large-scale transformations at the end of the Bronze Age were presumably supported by the intensification and specialization of economic activities at larger scales than in previous periods, though the precise mechanisms underpinning them remain unclear.

The timing of Lika's sociopolitical and economic florescence is especially surprising since it coincides with a centuries-long drying and warming event in the eastern Mediterranean that forced once-thriving settlements in the Italian terramare and central European Alps to be abandoned in the face of prolonged droughts and deteriorating climate (Cremaschi et al., 2006; Deak et al., 2018; Holzhauser et al., 2005; Magny, 2004; Röpke et al., 2011).

Unfortunately, for a number of reasons, no major settlement surveys or systematic excavation of over 200 documented hillfort sites in Lika or Ogulinsko-Plaščanska have been undertaken (Buršić-Matijašic, 2008) and archaeological data is almost exclusively from cemetery contexts.

This imbalance in the archaeological record has left the fine-grained processes behind sociopolitical and cultural development during these periods unclear.

The recent discovery of undocumented and unanalyzed faunal remains at the Archaeological Museum in Zagreb (AMZ) offers an unprecedented opportunity to examine changing sociopolitical and economic organization during this time through the lens of animal management practices.

SECTION

Bronze-Iron Age faunal assemblages

PARAGRAPH

AMZ faunal assemblages from ten hillforts and two caves were identified and grouped into three broad temporal periods based on typological assignations and/or new radiocarbon dates reported by Zavodny (2017): Middle Bronze (1600–1200 BCE), Late Bronze (1200–800 BCE), and Early Iron (800–400 BCE) Ages (Fig. 1; Table 1).

The Lika Museum Gospić provided material from an additional Early Iron Age site, Lipova Glavica.

Both Middle Bronze and Early Iron Age contexts were found at Veliki Vital.

PARAGRAPH

AMZ assemblages are from older excavations when the systematic collection of zooarchaeological material was not standard practice.

They are consequently small (NISP <50) and often lacking exact provenience.

The hand collection of specimens has also likely caused the over-representation of larger animals and more robust skeletal elements at the expense of microfauna and juveniles (Grayson, 1984).

Though small, old, and incomplete museum collections have often been overlooked, recent methodological studies have highlighted their usefulness for broadly characterizing regional and temporal trends in sociopolitical, economic, and cultural organization (Jones and Gabe, 2015; Leighton and Sørensen, 2004; Lyman, 2015; MacFarland and Vokes, 2017).

Similarly, “laundry lists” of species have been used to successfully compare regional animal economies despite uneven reporting of zooarchaeological material (Lyman, 2015; McClure and Welker, 2017).

While most of the AMZ assemblages are too small for site-level analysis, data aggregation from multiple sites allows us to describe broader regional and temporal trends in livestock and husbandry practices.

To our knowledge this is also the first publication of zooarchaeological data in Lika and we believe the benefits of publicizing these results far outweigh the limitations of the dataset.

PARAGRAPH

While a full faunal analysis is beyond the scope of this paper, preliminary work by Zavodny, McClure, and Welker confirm that a full suite of domesticated animals – sheep, goat, cattle, pig, dog, and horse- was present at hillfort settlements and caves in Gacka and Ličko valleys from the Middle Bronze Age through the Early Iron Age (Table 2).

These communities also exploited wild species, especially chamois and roe and red deer.

In the Ogulinsko-Plaščanska valley, initial analyses show that Early Iron Age settlements used a similar mix of domesticated and wild species (Table 2).

These findings are consistent with the zooarchaeological data reported from contemporary hillfort settlements in neighboring Dalmatia (Gaastra et al., 2014), Bosnia (Greenfield and Arnold, 2005) and Slovenia (Bartosiewicz, 1991, 1996, 1999; Dular and Hvala, 2007).

SECTION

Stable isotopes and animal management

PARAGRAPH

Stable isotope analyses are a useful tool for extracting information from fragmented collections and have been successfully used to identify and characterize a range of prehistoric animal management practices (e.g., Bocherens et al., 2015; Doppler et al., 2017; Jones and Mulville, 2018; Makarewicz and Tuross, 2012; Zavodny et al., 2014, 2015).

The anthropogenic manipulation of animal diet or home range is often isotopically visible and differences in values between species or over time can highlight changing patterns of management.

Stable carbon (δ13C) and especially nitrogen (δ15N) isotopes ratios of bone collagen are useful for approximating diet because they reflect the average dietary protein consumed during the last eight to ten years of an organism's life, depending on the bone sampled (Ambrose and Norr, 1993; Deniro and Epstein, 1978, 1981; Schoeninger and DeNiro, 1984).

C4 pathway plants are statistically more enriched than C3 pathway plants because of differences in their photosynthesizing processes, and the contributions of different plant types to diet can be measured via stable carbon isotope values (Deniro and Epstein, 1978; Pearson et al., 2007; van der Merwe, 1982; van der Merwe and Vogel, 1978).

Dietary input can be further inferred according to the isotopic composition of food at the trophic level of foods consumed, with δ15N becoming enriched at each subsequent level.

Differences in stable isotopic values between individuals or over time can also reflect changing patterns of mobility or residence, as studies have successfully linked stable isotope signatures to local environmental variation in seasonality, plant productivity, water availability, salinity, mean temperature, and altitude (e.g., Ambrose, 1991; Britton et al., 2008; Deniro and Epstein, 1978, 1981; Hedges et al., 2004; Makarewicz, 2014; Müldner et al., 2014; Szpak, 2014; Towers et al., 2011).

Methods

SECTION

Faunal analyses

PARAGRAPH

The assembled faunal remains from Lika are generally well preserved and were identified to species at the Penn State Zooarchaeology Laboratory using comparative materials and published criteria for species differentiation (e.g., Zeder and Lapham, 2010; Zeder and Pilaar, 2010).

Each specimen was measured, weighed, and photographed.

Domesticated species include cattle (Bos taurus), sheep (Ovis aries), goat (Capra hircus), pig (Sus scrofa), dog (Canis familiaris), and horse (Equus caballus).

Wild species include roe (Capreolus capreolus) and red (Cervus elaphus) deer, chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), wild boar (Sus scrofa), hare (Lepus europaeus), and an unidentified felid (Felidae spp.).

PARAGRAPH

Samples chosen for stable isotope analyses reflect species-specific minimum number of individuals (MNI) for each site.

The number of Middle Bronze Age samples is especially limited because of the general lack of contexts from this period.

Similarly, only Early Iron Age assemblages were available for sites in Ogulinsko-Plaščanska valley.

SECTION

Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses

PARAGRAPH

Sixty samples selected for stable carbon and nitrogen analyses were processed using standard collagen extraction procedures at the Penn State University Human Palaeoecology and Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory (Kennett et al., 2017).

Approximately 500 mg of dry bone was sampled per specimen after manual cleaning to remove organic contaminants.

Samples were then crushed to increase the area of reactive surface, washed in NanoPure water, and demineralized in 0.5 N HCl at 5 °C for several days.

In cases of poor psuedomorph preservation, the prescribed NaOH wash was omitted to avoid further collagen degradation.

Samples were then prepared for collagen extraction and purification according to the modified Longin (1971) method with ultrafiltration (Brown et al., 1988).

Bone collagen samples too poorly preserved for ultrafiltration were processed using a modified XAD-purification method (Lohse et al., 2014; Stafford et al., 1988, 1991) in which extracted collagen was gelatinized at 110 °C in 1 mL 0.02 N HCl for 24 h, then pipetted into a pre-cleaned 10 mL disposable syringe with an attached pre-cleaned 0.45 μm Millex Durapore PVDF filter and driven into a thick-walled culture tube.

The sample gelatin was then hydrolyzed in 1.5 mL 6 N HCl for 24 h at 110 °C before being driven through a SPE column with an additional 10 mL 6 N HCl and dried under UHP N2 gas while being heated at 50 °C for 12 h.

PARAGRAPH

Carbon and nitrogen concentrations and stable isotope ratios were analyzed at the Yale Analytical and Stable Isotope Center.

δ13C and δ15N values are reported in standard ‰ notation with respect to VPDB and atmospheric nitrogen, respectively.

Sample quality was evaluated with %C, %N, and C:N ratios before further analysis (Deniro, 1985; van Klinken, 1999).

C:N ratios fall between 3.2 and 3.5 and reflect good preservation for isotopic analyses (Table 3).

Statistical analyses are used sparingly because of small sample sizes.

When appropriate, we use two-tailed t-tests assuming unequal variances (Ruxton, 2006).

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope results are presented by time period in Table 3 and Figs. 2 and 3.

These values are consistent with those expected for a terrestrial C3 environment (Deniro and Epstein, 1978, 1981; Richards and Trinkaus, 2009).

SECTION

Middle Bronze Age (1600–1200 BCE)

PARAGRAPH

Fourteen wild and domesticated faunal elements were sampled from Jozgina Pećina in Ličko Valley and Ličko-Lešće and Veliki Vital in Gacka Valley (Fig. 2).

As a group, Middle Bronze Age domesticated animals (n = 9) exhibit δ13C values between −22.1 and −17.3‰ and δ15N values between 4.1 and 10.2‰.

Cattle (n = 3), all from Gacka valley, have δ13C values from −22.0 to −20.6‰ and δ15N values from 4.1 to 7.3‰.

The single goat has a δ13C value of −20.9‰ and a δ15N value of 4.7‰, while the unidentified ovicaprid has a similar δ13C value of −21.3‰ but a higher δ15N value of 6.4‰.

The pig has a δ13C value of −19.0‰ and δ15N value of 6.8‰.

The dog has a δ13C value of −17.3‰ and δ15N value of 10.2‰.

The two horses have very similar δ13C values (−22.1‰ and −22.0‰) but slightly divergent δ15N values at 4.7 and 6.3‰.

PARAGRAPH

The sampled wild species (n = 5) exhibit δ13C values between −22.9 to −19.1‰.

At first glance the reported δ15N values appear to be quite variable, ranging from 2.8 to 8.3‰, but this is due to the extreme values reported for the hare (2.8‰) and felid (8.3‰).

The felid's elevated δ15N and δ13C value of −19.1‰ follows the expected trophic shift for carnivores (Schoeninger and DeNiro, 1984).

Sampled herbivores, excluding the hare, have δ15N values clustering between 5.2 and 6.1‰.

The single roe deer has a δ13C value of −21.4‰ and a δ15N value of 6.1‰, and the red deer has a δ13C value of −20.6‰ and a δ15N value of 5.7‰.

The chamois has δ13C value of −21.3‰ and a δ15N value of 5.2‰.

SECTION

Late Bronze Age (1200–800 BCE)

PARAGRAPH

Seventeen wild and domesticated faunal elements were sampled from Cvituša, Piplica, and Miljača in Ličko Valley and Hrvatsko Polje in Gacka Valley (Fig. 2).

Domesticated animals from this period (n = 14) exhibit δ13C values between −21.7 and −17.7‰ and δ15N values between 3.4 and 7.8‰ (Table 3).

Cattle (n = 4) exhibit δ13C values between −21.7 and −20.6‰ and δ15N values from 3.4 to 4.6‰.

Two ovicaprids have δ13C values of −21.5‰ and −20.5‰ and δ15N values of 5.9‰ and 4.5‰.

The single sheep has a similar δ13C value of −21.1‰ and δ15N value of 5.8‰.

The individual goat has a δ13C value of −20‰ and δ15N value of 5.6‰.

Pigs (n = 5) exhibit δ13C values between −20.1 and −19.0 ‰ and δ15N values from 5.1 to 7.7‰.

The solitary dog has a δ13C value of −17.7‰ and δ15N value of 7.8‰.

PARAGRAPH

Wild animals (n = 3) have δ13C values tightly clustering between −21.5 to −21.0‰ and δ15N values between 2.8 and 4.4‰.

The low δ15N value of 2.8‰ is from a red deer from Hrvatsko Polje.

The δ15N value for the roe deer is 4‰ and for the chamois it is 4.4‰.

SECTION

Early Iron Age (800–400 BCE)

PARAGRAPH

29 wild and domesticated faunal elements were sampled from Lipova Glavica, Stražbenica, and Žagarova Glavica and Gradina kod Pošte in Ličko Valley; Veliki Vital and Veliki and Mali Obljaj in Gacka Valley; and Trošmarija and Velika Metaljka in Ogulinsko-Plaščanska Valley (Fig. 3).

PARAGRAPH

Domesticated animals from this period (n = 23) exhibit δ13C values between −22.6 and −17.0‰ and δ15N values between 3.0 and 7.9‰ (Table 3).

Cattle (n = 11) have δ13C values ranging from −22.3 to −20.4‰ and δ15N values between 3.0 and 6.6‰.

Ovicaprids (n = 2) have δ13C values of −20.7 and −19.8 ‰ and δ15N values of 6.3 and 7.9‰, while two sheep have δ13C values of −21.1 and −20.3 ‰ and δ15N values of 4.3 and 5.3‰.

Pigs (n = 6) exhibit δ13C values between −22.6 and −17.0‰ and δ15N values between 4.3 and 7.1‰.

Two dogs have δ13C values of −19.8 and −18.6 ‰ and δ15N values of 6.1 and 6.8‰.

PARAGRAPH

Wild animals (n = 6) have δ13C values ranging from −24.1 to −20.3‰ and δ15N values between 3.8 and 6.3‰.

Roe deer (n = 2) have δ13C values between −21.6 and −21.1 ‰ and δ15N values from 5.4 to 6.3‰, while red deer (n = 2) have δ13C values of −24.1 and −20.3‰ and δ15N values of 4.3 and 5.2‰.

The wild boar from Trošmarija has a δ13C value of −21.1‰ and a δ15N value of 5.5‰ and the chamois from Velika Metaljka has a δ13C value of −21.3‰ and a δ15N value of 3.8‰.

SECTION

Animal management at multiple scales

SECTION

The development of large-scale herding systems

PARAGRAPH

Today Lika and Ogulinsko-Plaščanska valley are heavily forested with cleared pastures and fields constrained to narrow valley bottoms.

Our stable isotope results suggest a similar landscape existed during the Middle-Late Bronze Ages and Early Iron Age.

The heavy vegetation cover found in forests prevents the penetration of light and ventilation to the forest floor, creating a known depletion in plant carbon abundance (Ambrose and DeNiro, 1986; van der Merwe and Medina, 1991).

This “canopy effect” is in turn reflected in the bone collagen of herbivores living near or in the forest.

Roe deer and chamois frequent the transitional zones between forests and open environments and are a useful measure for estimating the stable carbon isotope threshold between these spaces.

Individuals from Lika and Ogulinsko-Plaščanska have an average δ13C value of −21.4 ± 0.2‰, which is comparable to values published in other studies (Table 3; Bocherens et al., 2015; Drucker et al., 2003, Drucker et al., 2011).

Modern red deer often inhabit deep forest in order to avoid human activity (Jeppesen, 1987), but recent investigation of prehistoric red deer suggests they were widely adaptable to different ecological zones (Schnitzler et al., 2018).

Red deer from our study exhibit a high level of inter-individual variation in stable isotope values that signals this same diversity of feeding behaviors and home ranges, from deep forest at Trošmarija in Ogulinsko-Plaščanska to more transitional and open spaces in Lika proper (Table 3).

PARAGRAPH

Throughout the mid-late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age, domesticated cattle, goat, and sheep δ13C values largely overlap with those of wild herbivores (Fig. 4).

This homogeneity may simply be the result of low baseline variation in natural vegetation since there are no known indigenous C4 plants, but it is also possible these similar values reflect the pasturing of domesticated herbivores along forest borders or in small clearings within the forests themselves.

PARAGRAPH

Some cattle (LL-01 and TR-10) are even more depleted in δ13C than contemporary deer, suggesting they either fed almost exclusively in the forest understory or were foddered with leaves and twigs collected by their handlers.

Winter leaf foddering is a historically well-documented practice in Europe (Halstead and Tierney, 1998) and has been proposed for prehistoric contexts as well (Balasse et al., 2012; Berthon et al., 2017).

Sheep and goat also overlap in dietary space with cattle and deer, though as a group they have a slightly more positive stable carbon signature, especially in the Early Iron Age.

This trend suggests they may have been more prone to frequent open areas of the landscape (Fig. 4).

PARAGRAPH

In an overall comparison, ovicaprids1 and cattle have significantly different δ15N values (p = 0.02; t-test assuming unequal variances, Ruxton, 2006).

Sample sizes are too small for statistically significant comparisons across time periods, but Fig. 4 illustrates the general differences between goats, sheep, and cattle over time.

During the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages, ovicaprids have nitrogen values that are on average ~1‰ more positive than those of cows.

This same difference is also present in the Middle Bronze Age if we exclude the individual cow from Veliki Vital (VVA-19) with an exceptionally high δ15N signature, potentially from nursing (Balasse and Tresset, 2002).

Other studies have suggested that differences of ~1‰ or greater signal interspecies differences in resource availability or management strategies (Ascough et al., 2014).

Differences in digestive morphology can also affect stable nitrogen values, with dedicated grazers generally having more positive values than browsers (Bocherens et al., 2015; Lohse et al., 2014; Sponheimer et al., 2003).

While sheep are committed grazers, cattle can be trained to increase their browsing behavior (Scoones, 1975).

Modern buša cattle (Bos brachyeros europeus) endemic to Lika are fed a diet heavily supplemented with available browse and herded seasonally into the mountains (Ramljak et al., 2011; Todorović, 2013).

Browsing cattle are able to exploit the more transitional zones between open field and forest, and this behavior could account for the more negative δ15N and δ13C values of our prehistoric cattle in comparison to other domesticated herbivores.

PARAGRAPH

Increased variation in δ15N values among cattle and ovicaprids in the Early Iron Age suggest that herding and feeding practices were modified over time (Figs. 2–4).

In the literature, similar increases in variation have alternatively been argued to indicate either the devolution of herding practices to the household-level (Szpak et al., 2014) or the intensification of management in the form of moving larger or multiple herds across greater swaths of the landscape (Pearson et al., 2007).

Given the appearance of new hillfort centers in the region during this period, we suggest it is more likely husbandry strategies were being centralized alongside other sociopolitical and economic practices during this time.

As animal and human populations grew but the amount of arable land in valley bottoms remained the same, Early Iron Age communities may have been incentivized to exploit non-local fields, including seasonal mountain pastures.

Supporting this theory is the lack of any discernable isotopic signature of foddering cattle and ovicaprids with millet, despite its prevalence in contemporary human diets (Zavodny et al., 2017).

This suggests that herds were kept physically separate from crops during the growing season and were also not close enough to settlements to be fed chaff and other waste products during harvesting.

The practice of purposefully moving livestock into the mountains to protect crops is documented historically in Lika (Forenbaher, 1996, 2011) and other mountainous regions (Rhoades and Thompson, 1975).

SECTION

Small-scale management of pigs

PARAGRAPH

In contrast to the possible centralization and/or expansion of cattle and ovicaprid herding over time, pig husbandry appears to have remained under household control throughout the study period.

Domesticated pigs exhibit significantly more positive δ13C values than other livestock (v. cows, p = 0.005; v. ovicaprids, p = 0.01; t-tests assuming unequal variances), above what is expected even when adjusting for the trophic effects of an omnivorous diet.

Agricultural by-products often used as fodder, such as leaves and stems, are typically enriched in δ15N relative to fruits and grains (Szpak, 2014), which could explain pigs' elevated nitrogen in relation to other livestock (Fig. 4).

Higher stable nitrogen isotope values have also been found to correlate with stocking, penning, or foddering with crops fertilized with manure (Bogaard et al., 2013; Britton et al., 2008; Madgwick et al., 2012; Makarewicz, 2014; Oelze et al., 2011; Schoeninger and DeNiro, 1984), while other studies have found prehistoric pigs were frequently fed meat scraps (Madgwick et al., 2012; Jones and Mulville, 2016).

Unlike cattle and ovicaprids, it appears that pigs in Lika and Ogulinsko-Plaščanska were also regularly fed portions of millet either directly or through waste products (Figs. 2–4).

PARAGRAPH

By the Early Iron Age in Gacka and Ličko valleys, there is no overlap in stable carbon isotope values between pigs and other livestock that suggests they were exploiting the same food sources or spaces (Figs. 3–4).

Pigs also do not show the same broadened variability in stable carbon or nitrogen isotope values as ovicaprids and cattle, indicating they may have been more constrained in their movement.

Potential management practices such as penning and provisioning of household waste would have required pigs to remain in closer proximity to human settlements than other animals.

Dogs, another domesticate usually found in or near human settlements, exhibit similar stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values to pigs and humans as well (Figs. 2–3; Zavodny et al., 2017).

PARAGRAPH

Though only four sites had more than one individual for sampling, there appears to be some inter-site variation in stable isotope values, signaling possible site or even household-specific management styles.

For instance, Miljača and Stražbenica pigs do not overlap in dietary space but there is very little intra-individual variation at each site (Fig. 5).

Miljača pigs exhibit stable isotope values more similar to the wild boar from Trošmarija, suggesting a largely C3 plant-based diet that is in keeping with modern feeding studies of wild and feral pigs (Balarri and Barrios-García, 2013).

Pigs from Stražbenica appear to have had access to different resources (e.g., meat, millet), though they also show small intra-individual variation in stable isotope values.

More variation exists between the pigs from Hrvatsko Polje, and could represent a different approach to stocking, penning, or feeding than at other sites.

PARAGRAPH

The two individuals from Trošmarija have strikingly different stable isotope values (Fig. 5), though they come from the same house context dating to the very end of the Early Iron Age (415–380 cal BCE; Zavodny, 2017).

One pig (TR-16) has a stable isotope signature similar to those at other Early Iron Age sites, while the other pig (TR-17) has more negative stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values than most other contemporary fauna, wild or domesticated.

Age-specific (nursing) or seasonal practices (winter leaf-foddering) could explain this intra-site pattern, but unfortunately age markers are missing from these samples.

It is also possible that some pigs were left to range freely in the forests near the settlement for most of the year and were only sparingly managed.

Future study and larger sample sizes are needed from Trošmarija and other sites to determine the exact nature of regional pig husbandry practices in the Bronze and Iron Ages.

Conclusion

PARAGRAPH

Despite Lika's perceived inhospitable environment throughout (pre)history, our findings suggest a trend towards intensified and expanded animal management practices as the Iapodian culture coalesced into a regional sociopolitical and economic system at the end of the Bronze Age.

Cattle and ovicaprid herds likely became larger and/or more numerous, necessitating the movement to non-local pastures.

In Lika there is nowhere else to go but up, and we suggest livestock was herded into the hillsides around valleys or into even higher mountain pastures in order to preserve valley bottoms for agriculture.

This scaling up of livestock practices throughout the region likely also required more concerted planning among households, sites, or even valleys.

Pig husbandry, however, appears to have remained a small-scale affair and there is limited evidence that feeding and penning practices were site-specific.

In general, though, the animals were kept in or near settlements and their diets heavily managed by humans.

The exception to this is Trošmarija, where some pigs may have also been free-ranged or allowed to become feral.

PARAGRAPH

Overall, these first results suggest a much more complex picture of animal management than previously imagined.

The successful layering of animal management practices at multiple spatial and organizational scales allowed communities to exploit their finite resources in ways that supported the rapid expansion of new centers.

These strategies likely became increasingly important as larger climatic events in the eastern Mediterranean stunted growth in other regions but never seemingly affected economic development in Lika or Ogulinsko-Plaščanska valley.

Future research on expanded datasets will undoubtedly offer more insight into how these Bronze and Iron Age populations managed their animals, crops, and people to such an effective degree, and how we can best adapt these lessons to seemingly marginal environments today.
