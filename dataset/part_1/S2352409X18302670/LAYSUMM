TITLE

Reconstructing body mass of the Australian dingo (Canis dingo) from two simple measurements of the hard palate

PARAGRAPH

The reconstruction of body size is useful for investigating temporal variation in the size of the Australian dingo (Canis dingo), particularly in the context of human activity.

In the Canidae, numerous methods to reconstruct body mass have been proposed, however there is no one-size fits all approach.

Current methods are also often complex and have relatively high error rates.

Here, we present a regression equation to estimate body mass of the dingo based on two simple measurements of the hard palate, whilst ensuring that it could be used with incomplete skeletal material, and in studies of encephalisation.
