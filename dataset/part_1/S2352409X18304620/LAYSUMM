TITLE

Geochemical analysis and spatial trends of ceramics and clay from Angamuco, Michoacán

PARAGRAPH

Between 250 CE and 1530 CE, ancestral Purépecha people lived at the ancient city of Angamuco, a volcanic landform within the Lake Pátzcuaro Basin, central-western Mexico.

Angamuco is located near Tzintzuntzan, the capital of the Purépecha Empire (1350-1530 CE), and is thus an important case study for examining the impacts of political change on people living at one site.

Information from ceramic artifacts excavated at Angamuco indicate that residents were using similar recipes to make pottery before and during empire formation.

This suggests that broader political changes do not always manifest at the scale of local craft production.
