TITLE

Improving the chronological framework for Laugerie-Haute Ouest (Dordogne, France)

PARAGRAPH

Laugerie-Haute is a famous UNESCO World Heritage listed limestone rockshelter in southwest France.

It has an important sequence of Paleolithic cultures, especially the Solutrean and the so-called “Aurignacian V”.

Despite its long history of research starting in the 1860s, the exact timing of human occupation was not clear.

A new series of radiocarbon samples was taken from one of the preserved sections to improve our understanding.

The results indicate that the sequence was deposited between 28,000 and 19,000 years ago and confirm the stratigraphic integrity of the site.

In addition, the first dates for the “Aurignacian V” in southwest France place this rare phenomenon approximately 26,000 years ago.

The results strengthen the existing chronological framework for this part of ice age Europe.
