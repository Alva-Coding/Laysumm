TITLE

Evaluating competition and conflict among western Ukraine Neolithic farmers with stable isotope analyses of human teeth

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Stable carbon, oxygen and radiogenic strontium isotope analyses of human teeth of three individuals from Verteba Cave (Fig. 1) in Ukraine are used to examine the issues of population migration and violence through the lens of dietary resources.

Excavations from 2008 and 2012 have produced a minimum of 36 individuals associated with the Tripolie culture group.

Of these 36, 12 are represented by mostly complete crania.

Eleven of the 12 present cranial fractures, a few of which display multiple fractures.

Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the dramatic increase in interpersonal violence at this time (Korvin-Piotrovskiy, 2012).

Either 1) competing immigrants moving into the area caused conflict (Kruts, 2012; Korvin-Piotrovskiy, 2012), or 2) local populations began warring over scarce agricultural resources (Chapman, 2017; Korvin-Piotrovskiy, 2012; Zbenovich, 1996).

We evaluate these hypotheses through a pilot study of carbon, oxygen and strontium isotope data of tooth enamel from three individuals in order to identify possible immigrants.

SECTION

Archaeological background

PARAGRAPH

The Tripolie is an Eneolithic archaeological culture that dates to 4800–2900 cal.

BC in the region that now corresponds to the modern nations of Ukraine, Moldova and Romania (Fig. 1) (Zbenovich, 1996; Rassamakin, 2012).

The Tripolie culture in Romania is named Cucuteni (Lillie, 2008).

Tripolie-Cucuteni and Cucuteni-Tripolie are names commonly used to recognize this unity (e.g. Zvelebil and Dolukhanov, 1991).

However, some researchers propose that Tripolie were not a “unified cultural group” (Diachendo and Harper, 2016, pp. 82) but were made up of heterogeneous ethnic groups with social differentiation (Manzura, 2005, pp. 334).

Tripolie distribution reached from the Carpathian Piedmont in the west, the Dneiper River in the east, south to the Black Sea and north to Kiev (Videiko, 2004).

In Ukraine, the Czech Republic and Slovakia the Eneolithic is defined as beginning with the onset of copper metallurgy and ends with the start of the Bronze Age (Milisauskas, 2011).

The Tripolie population density in the Dneister area is estimated at 12 individuals per square kilometer, making it one of the most densely settled areas in Europe (Korvin-Piotrovskiy, 2012).

The Tripolie-Cucuteni culture area was contemporary with several adjacent Eneolithic cultures, including the Baden and Globular Amphorae cultures (Fowler et al., 2015).

PARAGRAPH

Detailed relative and absolute chronologies divide the Tripolie culture into five phases and subphases, including Tripolie A (4900–4300 cal.

BC), Tripolie BI (4300–4100 cal.

BC), Tripolie BII (4100–3600 cal.

BC), Tripolie CI (3600–3200 cal.

BC) and Tripolie CII (3400–2750 cal.

BC) (Nikitin et al., 2010; Videiko, 2004).

Each is associated with distinct pottery manufacture techniques and decoration (Ryzhov, 2012).

PARAGRAPH

Tripolie subsistence was based on agriculture, pastoralism and hunting and foraging of wild resources.

Evidence from the paleobotanical remains at Tripolie sites suggests cultivation of domestics such as hulled wheat types of emmer, einkorn and spelt, hulled and non-hulled barley, peas, bitter vetch and lentils (Pashkevych, 2008).

Frequent recovery of hulled wheat shows that these crops were important components of their diet (Zbenovich, 1996).

Cereals may have been eaten in the form of porridges, as indicated by the presence of crushed hulled wheat grains inside a pot at the Maydanetske site, Ukraine (Pashkevych, 2008).

Wild grapes, cornelian cherries, plums and pears were found included in the foraged botanical remains (Pashkevych, 2004).

Hunting and fishing continued to be part of the subsistence strategy demonstrated by presence of roe deer and red deer, wild pigs, aurochs and catfish (Korvin-Piotrovskiy, 2012).

According to zooarchaeological finds, the Tripolie also practiced pastoralism of cattle, pigs, sheep and goats (Markova, 2008; Zhuralev, 2008).

Cattle are most often dominant in the archaeological record.

However, frequencies of domestic species vary from site to site (Ledogar, 2017; Korvin-Piotrovskiy, 2012).

PARAGRAPH

The decline of the Tripolie culture during the CII period (3400–2750 cal BC) was marked by an increase in violent conflict.

Increased violence is indicated by the establishment of fortifications at Zhvanets-Schovb, Costesti and Kazarovichy (Markevich, 1981; Korvin-Piotrovskiy, 2012).

These settlements were fortified with ditches (Chapman and Gaydarske, 2015) and mounds that were rebuilt multiple times and reinforced with stones.

Traumatic injuries on skeletons from Verteba Cave also attest to increasing conflict (Madden et al., 2018).

SECTION

Verteba cave and human remains

PARAGRAPH

Verteba Cave is a Tripolie culture mortuary site in Ukraine (Fig. 1), located near the village of Bilche Zolote, Ternopil Oblast, Ukraine, in the steppe forest ecozone.

The limestone cave is 8555 m long (Nikitin et al., 2010) and is associated with Tripolie material culture.

Analysis of pottery has been used to place the cave in the BII, CI and CII periods of the Tripolie relative chronology, covering 4100–2750 cal.

BC (Nikitin et al., 2010; Videiko, 2004).

Direct dates of human remains from site 7 affirm this location within the cave dates between 7955 and 3522 cal BC (Ledogar, 2017; Ledogar et al., 2018; Lillie et al., 2017).

This is one site of many within the cave, but the only site to be discussed in this work.

There are two areas in site 7, Area 1 excavated in 2008 contained the remains of 13 individuals, including subadults, adults, and both sexes.

Area 1 held 10 complete crania, more than any site within the cave.

Area 1 is a small tunnel.

Six complete crania located here were found near the cave walls, including one cache of 4 complete and 1 partial crania.

At the close of excavation in 2008 one tooth was taken from 3 Area 1 crania that displayed perimortem trauma.

These 3 crania have been radiocarbon dated by Lillie et al. (2017) using 1.5 in.

triangular sections of bone from the occipital portion of the skull, these have dates ranging from 3911 to 3522 cal BC.

Area 2 was added to the excavation in 2012 and is connected to Area 1 by a small passageway that was blocked in antiquity by standing stones.

Three more complete crania were discovered in Area 1, and an additional complete cranium was recovered in the passageway between Area 1 and 2 during 2012 excavations.

Area 2 held the only post-cranial bones in articulation at site 7.

Nine of the 11 crania with trauma were found in Area 1 with the remaining 2 crania in Area 2.

The separation of most of the crania (including most of those with trauma) and articulated post-crania suggests ritual activity.

Radiocarbon dates were run on a hand phalange (3930–3877 cal BC) and a zygomatic from Area 2 (7955–7705 cal BC) (Ledogar, 2017; Ledogar et al., 2018) displaying temporal overlap with Area 1 in the higher levels.

PARAGRAPH

All human remains excavated from Verteba Cave were interred as secondary burials (Madden et al., 2018) and intermixed with pottery, stone and bone tools, faunal remains and ceramic figurines.

Excavation in 2012 added 23 individuals for a total minimum number of 36 individuals.

These 36 individuals represent males, females, juveniles, as well as adults old and young.

Prior to the finds at Verteba Cave few remains have been found associated with the Tripolie culture in the west, mostly individual inhumations beneath house floors (Ledogar et al., 2018).

Multiple inhumations at this location, not associated with particular above ground settlements show this to be a unique site.

PARAGRAPH

Taphonomy of the remains includes carnivore tooth marks and whitening due to weathering from exposure outside the cave as the primary stage of the burial ritual (Madden et al., 2018).

Two skulls with evidence of perimortem depression fractures also have cutmarks that may indicate dismemberment or excarnation (Lillie et al., 2015, Kadrow and Pokutta, 2016), however most of the remains were completely disarticulated.

Four left arms, two hands, and one vertebral column belonging to different individuals were found mostly articulated.

Evidence of violence is pervasive (Fig. 2), with a frequency of cranial trauma at 57% including all complete and partial crania (Madden et al., 2018).

SECTION

Diet and residential history reconstruction with stable isotopes

PARAGRAPH

Strontium isotope (87Sr/86Sr) analysis has been used extensively within archaeology to examine mobility of both humans and other animals (Balasse et al., 2002; Bentley et al., 2004; Ezzo et al., 1997; Grupe et al., 1997; Hodell et al., 2004; Hoppe et al., 1999; Price et al., 1994a; Price et al., 1994b; Price et al., 2000; Sillen et al., 1998; van der Merwe et al., 2000).

Tooth enamel does not turn over once formed so isotopic signatures recovered from tooth enamel will reflect the dietary signature during the time of tooth mineralization (Longinelli, 1984; Luz et al., 1984).

Analysis of strontium isotope ratio variation among teeth formed at different developmental ages can provide an important source of information on animal and human movements through a region (Balasse et al., 2002; Ericson, 1985; Ericson, 1989; Price et al., 1994a; Price et al., 1994b; Sealy, 1989a; Sealy, 1989b; Sealy et al., 1991; Sillen et al., 1998).

However, several environmental factors affect the bioavailable soil strontium of different ages, isotope ratios and origins in ingested food and water, including the composition of the underlying rock, the rate and extent of rock weathering, soil weathering, soil drainage, pH, aeolian dust and rainwater transport (Capo et al., 1998; Naiman et al., 2000; Montgomery, 2010; Kennedy et al., 1998).

Where strontium concentrations in bedrock are low, aeolian and other sources of Sr enriched sediments, particularly carbonates, may override the local bedrock signature (Balasse et al., 2002; Capo et al., 1998; Naiman et al., 2000; Kennedy et al., 1998).

Therefore, migration studies must utilize strontium isotope ratios of bioavailable strontium in food and water, rather than solely of substrate geology to construct a local and regional isoscape.

The local 87Sr/86Sr range for a site can be obtained by measuring a combination of modern control samples that may include rock, soil, plants, water, small mammals (Hodell et al., 2004; Ezzo et al., 1997; Grupe et al., 1997; Sillen et al., 1998) and terrestrial mollusk shell (Price et al., 2000).

PARAGRAPH

Carbon and oxygen isotopic analyses provide further data to identify migrants to a region.

Terrestrial plants can be divided into three groups based on differential means of fixing atmospheric CO2.

The different photosynthetic pathways result in distinct δ13C values.

These differences in the δ13C values of the plants consumed are reflected in the tissues of the individuals that consume them (Deniro and Epstein, 1978; Vogel, 1978).

The two main photosynthetic pathways are named C3 and C4, based on the number of carbon atoms fixed in the first stage of photosynthesis.

They have distinct, non-overlapping ranges of δ13C values.

The δ13C values of C3 plants range from −33‰ in humid deep forest understories to −22‰ in open dry habitats, with an average of −27‰.

C4 plants have δ13C values that range from −16 to −9‰, with an average of −12.5‰.

Vegetation in the region is dominated by C3 plants (Kremenetski, 1995; Lillie and Richards, 2000).

Oxygen isotopic composition of the enamel bioapatite is directly linked to the isotopic composition of the environmental water that is ingested, and is an additional indicator of mobility (Land et al., 1980; Longinelli, 1984; Luz et al., 1984; Stuart-Williams and Schwarcz, 1997).

SECTION

Hypotheses and tests of causes for violence in the Tripolye-Cucuteni

PARAGRAPH

Two hypotheses have been proposed for interpersonal violence in the Tripolye-Cucuteni Eneolithic.

The first hypothesis holds that during the CI period increased conflict was reflected by fighting between local Tripolie groups such as the Shipentsy and Brahazy local groups (Tkachuk, pers.

comm.).

The second suggests that the conflict resulted from political instability during the CII period as migrants move into the region.

These new populations are suggested to be Baden and/or Globular Amphora cultures from areas to the north (Korvin-Piotrovskiy, 2012).

The CII period corresponds to the end of the Holocene Climatic Optimum, a period that is marked by colder and more arid environments (Kremenetskii, 1991).

Following this environmental deterioration and an associated decline in agricultural productivity, there may have been increased competition for resources within the group (Korvin-Piotrovskiy, 2012), potentially with the more militaristic Ustavo to the south (Madden et al., 2018).

PARAGRAPH

Support for hypothesis one, increased conflict between local groups, would be suggested by minimal variation in all isotopic signature for all individuals.

That is, a resident population consuming local food (carbon isotopes) and local water (oxygen isotopes), living in the local geology (reflected in the biologically available strontium).

If the strontium and oxygen isotope data shows signatures outside the local range, this might suggest immigrants to the region supportive of hypothesis two.

As diet is closely linked with identity and/or ethnicity (Twiss, 2007; Beehr and Ambrose, 2007; Dong, 2013; Dong et al., 2017), differences in carbon isotopes among individuals may further reflect the presence of immigrants further supporting hypothesis 2.

However, immigrant status requires confirmation by other lines of evidence including archaeological contextual evidence and perhaps DNA (Haak et al., 2008; Montgomery, 2010).

Social inequality and gender differences in diet may also result in differences in skeletal carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (Ambrose et al., 2003; Dong et al., 2017).

SECTION

Materials and methods

PARAGRAPH

Three teeth were selected for analysis (Table 1) from remains excavated in 2008.

Sample size was limited due to a small number of teeth available in the population.

All individuals were young adults (one age at death 17–25 and two aged 25–35 years).

A different tooth type was selected from each individual based on the presence and preservation within the dental arcade.

All enamel crowns were of the permanent dentition, formed after weaning, which minimizes the maternal skeletal mineral inheritance effect observed for teeth formed before weaning (Gulson et al., 1997).

Teeth were selected over bone as they are less subject to diagenesis.

Local bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr was determined by analysis of five modern snail shell samples collected from outside Verteba Cave, as well as published sources (Lillie et al., 2017; Julien et al., 2012).

PARAGRAPH

Teeth and shell were sampled and prepared for analysis by ERA.

The enamel surface (and shell specimens) was first cleaned with a tungsten drill bit.

Samples were removed using a diamond drill bit on a Dremel ™ multitool while viewing the surface through a low magnification lens (×3).

Enamel samples weighing 4–5 mg of enamel were prepared for analysis following Balasse et al. (2002), involving pretreatment with 2.63% NaOCl (sodium hypochlorite bleach) to remove organic matter, and 0.1 M acetic acid to remove diagenetic carbonate.

For carbon and oxygen isotopic analyses, treated enamel samples weighing ~700 μg were placed in individual vessels and reacted with 100% phosphoric acid (H3PO4) at 70 °C under vacuum in a Kiel III automated carbonate reaction cryogenic distillation device.

Purified CO2 from enamel carbonate was analyzed on a Finnigan MAT 252 isotopic ratio mass spectrometer at the Anthropology Department Environmental Isotope Paleobiogeochemistry Laboratory and Illinois State Geological Survey Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

Precision (± 1 standard deviation) of NBS18 and NBS19 standards is typically ±0.07‰ for δ13C and ±0.14‰ for δ18O.

Three samples of each standard are included in analysis of each set of 44 samples to monitor consistency of analyses from beginning to end of a sample sequence.

PARAGRAPH

Strontium isotope ratio measurements were performed on a Nu Plasma HR multi-collector inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Geology Department.

Tooth enamel samples (pretreated as described above) were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 3 N nitric acid (HNO3).

Cation exchange columns loaded with Eichrom® Sr spec resin and pre-conditioned with 3 N HNO3 were prepared and the 0.5 ml samples loaded.

Column blanks consisted of 0.5 ml of 3 N HNO3.

After washing the columns four times with 0.3 ml of 3 N HNO3 the strontium was eluted into 4 ml Teflon® vials with 1 ml of 0.05 N HNO3 and 3 ml of ultrapure deionized water (Milli-Q, Millipore).

Linear normalization of sample results was applied based on within-run trends in SRM 987 relative to its accepted value (0.710255).

Analytical precision on repeated standard measurements was ±0.00003.

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

Modern snail shell samples (n = 5) collected from outside Verteba Cave provide a biologically available strontium isotope ratio range of 0.70914 to 0.70921 (Table 2).

This local range can be extended slightly by two recent pig samples, 0.7091 and 0.7097 (Lillie et al., 2017) and corresponds well with the expected strontium baseline of Verteba Cave; a limestone cavern with 87Sr/86Sr values that correspond with seawater (~0.707 to 0.709) at the time of formation (Veizer, 1989).

Palaeoecological reconstructions and analysis of the migratory behavior of steppe bison in Eastern Ukraine at the site of Amvrosievka establish a biologically available 87Sr/86Sr range of 0.70912 to 0.70956, although 87Sr/86Sr values did range as high as 0.70962 (Julien et al., 2012).

With these three datasets of biologically available strontium for the region, we define the local range as 0.7091–0.7097.

Strontium, carbon and oxygen isotope analyses of tooth enamel, age at death, tooth formation age, and sex of individuals from Verteba Cave are reported in Table 1.

Human 87Sr/86Sr range from 0.70931 to 0.70975.

All individuals are closely aligned with the local signature (Fig. 3).

PARAGRAPH

Oxygen isotopes show a very small range of variation (only 0.4‰), from 23.4 to 23.8‰.

Similar oxygen isotope ratios have been reported for human samples from the northern Black Sea Coast (ranging from 23.7–24.9‰) (Iacumin et al., 2004).

The absence of significant interregional differences precludes use of oxygen isotopes to identify local and non-local individuals.

PARAGRAPH

Enamel δ13C values are tightly clustered from −11.5 to −11.9‰ (Table 1 and Fig. 3).

Biological apatite reflects the whole diet carbon isotope ratio while bone collagen reflects the protein component of the diet (Ambrose and Norr, 1993; Tieszen and Fagre, 1993).

It is suggested the C4 contribution to the diet may have been millet as an agricultural crop.

However, it is argued that millet was not available in Europe until the Iron Age (Lillie and Richards, 2000) and not currently identified from Tripolye sites.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

To contextualize these data, it is necessary to briefly discuss the skeletal signatures of inter- and intragroup violence.

Intergroup violence was reported in defensive ditches at Asparn/Schletz and Talheim (Teschler-Nicola et al., 1996) where bodies in articulation were found in a stacked mass free of burial goods (Wahl and Trautmann, 2012).

These finds are described as buried in haste, with little regard for the dead (Wahl and Trautmann, 2012).

The burials presenting violent interaction at Eulau were instead treated carefully which Meyer et al. (2009) use to suggest intragroup violence and burial of the dead by survivors.

While the burials at Verteba Cave are mostly disarticulated, they show purposeful placement within the cave, with a significant amount of time between burial and the violent interaction.

The burials at Verteba Cave are more closely aligned with those at Eulau than Asparn/Schletz suggesting a more intragroup association of the burials.

PARAGRAPH

Teeth sampled from Verteba Cave completed enamel mineralization and crown formation between 2.5 and 16 years of age.

The results suggest that these individuals are unlikely to be immigrants from areas to the north, especially when different teeth from the same dental arcade formed at different ages show little variation in both diet and mobility.

Our Sample EA 14 (Individual #4 Lillie et al., 2017) is the only individual with a strontium isotope ratio slightly outside the local range at 0.70975.

However, sampling of the earlier dentition at 6–7 years of age indicates local residence in the region of that individual (0.70962) further suggesting that this individual was indeed local from early childhood.

PARAGRAPH

The migrant hypothesis that we tested suggests that Baden and/or Globular Amphora cultures moved into this region from areas to the north (Korvin-Piotrovskiy, 2012).

Strontium isotope data are available from human burials associated with the Central European Corded Ware Culture (CWC).

This period is the successor to the Globular Amphorae Culture, so these data can be examined as a proxy for a local signature of immigrants from this area.

The 87Sr/86Sr values from the child burials from Eulau, Germany cluster around 0.7105 (Haak et al., 2008), ratios well above what is recorded in the individuals from Verteba Cave, effectively negating suggestions that individuals migrated to this region of Ukraine during this period and offering little support for hypotheses two as stated above.

PARAGRAPH

To use strontium isotope ratios to identify locals and immigrants, the Provenience Postulate must be upheld: the difference in foodweb strontium isotope ratios among regions must be greater than variation within regions (Weigand et al., 1977).

The interpretation of strontium isotopes from archaeological remains in this region is complicated as limited field baseline work has focused on the establishment of strontium isoscapes.

Comparable work by Julien et al. (2012) focusing on migratory bison includes only a simplified geological map of SE Ukraine, not one of biologically available strontium.

Most recently, Lillie et al. (2017) published a small pilot study of isotopic analyses of additional skeletons from Verteba and are also unable to provide a regional strontium map.

This is a key area for future ground truthing research and will be part of the 2018 field season directed by GM and JK.

PARAGRAPH

Oxygen isotope values of water sources may also vary within regions (Scherer et al., 2015), largely depending on amount of evaporative isotopic enrichment (Gat, 1996).

Drinking water sources, including rainwater, groundwater, springs and streams, have the lowest values in an ecosystem, and closed lake basins have higher values.

Plants have high rates of evaporation through leaf surfaces, particularly at high temperatures and low humidity (Helliker and Ehleringer, 2000).

Plant waters, carbohydrates, fats and proteins, particularly in leaves, have the highest δ18O values in an ecosystem.

Inter- and intraspecific variation in tooth enamel δ18O values of herbivores, omnivores and carnivores within and among ecosystems is largely explicable by relative reliance on drinking versus plant waters (Levin et al., 2006; White et al., 2009).

Seasonal variation in ingested water isotope ratios is also reflected in tooth enamel (Balasse et al., 2003; Julien et al., 2012).

These sources of variation must be evaluated before interpreting human isotopic variation in terms of residential history and non-local origins again highlighting the need for baseline environmental isoscape study and analyses prior to a sampling frenzy of archaeological material.

PARAGRAPH

You are what you eat plus a few permil: the δ13C values of the diet controls that of consumer tissues (DeNiro and Epstein, 1978; Vogel, 1978; Ambrose and Norr, 1993).

Therefore, the proportions of carbon derived from C3 and C4 plants consumed are reflected in the carbon isotopic composition of animal and human tissues.

Consumer tissue δ13C values are systematically enriched or depleted (fractionated) relative derive their carbon source.

Mammal bone apatite carbonate (bioapatite) in non-ruminant mammals is enriched by ~9.4‰, and collagen by ~5.1‰ (Ambrose and Norr, 1993).

Biological apatite reflects the whole diet carbon isotope ratio while bone collagen reflects mainly the protein component of the diet (Ambrose and Norr, 1993; Tieszen and Fagre, 1993).

Our analysis is from tooth enamel bioapatite rather than bone apatite or collagen.

Enamel may have a higher δ13C enrichment compared to bone collagen, at least in juvenile humans (when the majority of the teeth sampled here were formed), where one study reports an average enrichment of 4.3‰ (Webb et al., 2014).

PARAGRAPH

Enamel δ13C values are tightly clustered from −11.5 to −11.9‰ (Table 1).

A pure C3 terrestrial diet should have human enamel values lower than −15‰.

These δ13C values are less negative than expected for a purely C3 terrestrial diet, and may indicate a more broadly based diet that included C4 plants.

However, as noted above, if enamel is systematically enriched by ~4.3‰ (Webb et al., 2014) this would be the equivalent of 0–5% C4, which is not significantly different from a 100% C3 diet.

This may not constitute compelling evidence for consumption of C4 grains in the Eneolithic at Verteba.

Foodweb carbon isotope ratios tend to be less negative in continental interiors compared to humid coastal regions of Europe (Van Klinken et al., 2000).

This may in part account for higher human enamel δ13C values.

PARAGRAPH

While it is argued that millet was not available in Europe until the Iron Age (Lillie and Richards, 2000), Kadrow (2013) has found millet impressions in Tripolie ceramic vessels.

Additional recent palaeobotanical analyses have identified Panicum miliaceum from pottery impressions at the sites of Krushniki, Mala Osnitsa and Obolon from northwest Ukraine and the sites of Rovno and Sokoltsy 2 in western/central Ukraine, all dated to earlier than 5000 cal.

BC (Hunt et al., 2008).

However, direct AMS radiocarbon dating of carbonized millet grains from ten of these Neolithic sites show that all grains analyzed are younger than ~1500 cal.

B.C. (Motuzaite-Matuzeviciute et al., 2013).

Therefore, until Ukraine early millets are directly dated, they should be considered unconfirmed evidence for millet agriculture during the Tripolie-Cucuteni Eneolithic era.

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

Much stable isotope research has focused on reconstructing the human diet of Mesolithic/Neolithic foragers from the Dneiper region of Ukraine.

These analyses have focused on carbon and nitrogen isotopes of bone collagen of human and faunal remains (Lillie and Richards, 2000; Lillie and Jacobs, 2006; Lillie et al., 2011), and the question of the transition from a hunting/gathering economy to one based on domesticated plants and animals, and agricultural production.

Too much focus on the “stages” from gathering to agriculture supports old notions of unilineal hierarchical models of culture.

The data here from Verteba Cave and other geographically and temporally similar groups suggests the focus should be on the mix of gathering and production used by different cultures and more specifically at different sites.

This shift in focus with an increase in samples will allow for greater observation of variability and change within and between culture groups (Gaydarska, 2017).

PARAGRAPH

Lillie et al. (2017) have suggested dating and isotopic testing for all remains at the cave to ensure their provenance, while this would improve our understanding of the use of the cave and the Tripolie culture it would also require destruction of what is a unique sample.

This population is a non-renewable resource informing us of the past, we must be careful to balance potential knowledge gained with current technology against preservation of the remains for the future (Makarewicz and Sealy, 2015).

PARAGRAPH

Strontium, carbon and oxygen isotopic data on tooth enamel of three individuals provides new evidence to test the hypothesis of population migration and conflict during the Eneolithic period in western Ukraine.

While conclusions are limited due to small sample size, several preliminary observations may be made.

The small range (0.4‰) of carbon and oxygen isotope values suggests that all three individuals from Verteba Cave consumed similar diets, and suggests they came from the same cultural group.

The strontium and oxygen isotope values suggest a broadly local origin within Ukraine.

Their isotopic compositions differ from those of prehistoric humans to the north.

This suggests that they were not immigrants from northern areas.

Lillie et al. (2017) highlight the same conclusions with additional data from Verteba Cave.

PARAGRAPH

Recent radiocarbon dates place the individuals analyzed here within the period 3800–3600 cal BC (Ledogar, 2017; Ledogar et al., 2018; Lillie et al., 2017), suggesting that the site was used over the course of 200 years on multiple occasions.

DNA analysis is underway on individuals from Verteba Cave which may be used to observe familial ties among those inhumed here.

Strontium and oxygen isotopic evidence supports the hypothesis that these specific individuals were locally-born rather than immigrants to the regions.

PARAGRAPH

The high level of lethal violence at Verteba evinced by severe perimortem skeletal damage and no immigrant individuals so far detected suggests intragroup warfare over dietary resources rather than with immigrants.

This conclusion is predicated on the assumption that invaders would have settled locally and would have then integrated into the local communities and their cemeteries.

PARAGRAPH

Most of the isotopic research in this region to date has focused on palaeodietary reconstruction using bone collagen carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis.

This is an obvious direction for future research on the individuals recovered from Verteba Cave, particularly as this might aid in teasing apart the suggestion of different dietary regimes between eastern and western regions of the country.

Thorough evaluation of hypotheses of whether lethal conflict involved intra- versus inter-group confrontations, and immigration from other regions, requires isotopic analysis of bones and teeth of many more individuals from Verteba Cave and surrounding regions of Ukraine and beyond.

A more comprehensive survey of isoscape variation across this region (Slater et al., 2014; Arnold et al., 2016; Yazıcıoğlu Santamaria, 2018) is a priority to effectively evaluate geographic origins and residential mobility prior to expensive and destructive analyses.
