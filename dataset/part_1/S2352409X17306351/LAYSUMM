TITLE

Evaluating competition and conflict among western Ukraine Neolithic farmers with stable isotope analyses of human teeth

PARAGRAPH

Late Neolithic (3000-5000 BC) Tripolye culture burials in Verteba Cave, western Ukraine, include numerous burials with fresh cranial fractures, indicating frequent interpersonal violence.

Were these traumatic deaths due to clashes with immigrants, or to endemic warfare among long-established local territorial groups?

In order to test these alternative hypotheses, we used strontium isotopes of teeth to determined geographic origin, and carbon, oxygen and nitrogen isotopes of bones to identify local versus non-local diets of three individuals.

These individuals show local isotopic composition patterns.

This evidence suggests endemic lethal violence and warfare among neighboring Tripolie groups during the late Neolithic in Ukraine.
