TITLE

Online probabilistic goal recognition and its application in dynamic shortest-path local network interdiction

PARAGRAPH

Goal recognition is the task of inferring an agent's goals given some or all of the agent's observed actions.

However, few researchers focus on how to improve the usage effectiveness of knowledge produced by a goal recognition system.

In this work, we propose a probabilistic goal recognition approach tailored to a dynamic shortest-path network interdiction problem.

Also, we develop (i) two behavior modeling approaches to help solve both the data-intensive and no available data situations; (ii) a heuristic named Subjective Confidence that uses variance in particle system for flexible resource allocation adjustment.
