TITLE

A comparison of biodegradation caused by Teredinidae (Mollusca:Bivalvia), Limnoriidae (Crustacea:Isopoda), and C. terebans (Crustacea:Amphipoda) across 4 shipwreck sites in the English Channel

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

For centuries, timber has been a focal material for shipbuilding, with its wide spread availability, natural hardiness and workable qualities (Eaton and Hale, 1993); furthermore, numerous timber species are available, dependant on region, with elm, oak and pine most commonly used in European shipbuilding until mid-19th century (Couper, 2000; McGrail, 2001).

England has derived a prominent relationship with the sea, building global trade networks and developing a strong naval force (Smith, 2009; Vego, 2016); as such, the English Channel has an extensive history of trade, transport and warfare reflected in the many underwater cultural heritage (UCH) sites along the coastline (Pater, 2007).

However, many of these wooden UCH sites are at risk of degradation by marine wood borers within the Amphipoda, Isopoda and Myodia (Borges, 2014).

PARAGRAPH

Teredinidae (Mollusca:Bivalvia), consist of 68 species (Voight, 2015), with Teredo navalis and Lyrodus pedicellatus commonly found within English waters.

Both are protandrous hermaphrodites; born as males, they later transition into females, and spawn free swimming larvae into the water column (Coe, 1943; Lane, 1959; Appelqvist and Havenhand, 2016).

T. navalis remains in the water column for 17–34 days before settlement, and are capable of travelling large distances and inhabiting a range of sites (Appelqvist et al., 2015; Lippert et al., 2017).

L. pedicellatus retains their eggs until they are further along in their developmental stage (Wurzinger Mayer et al., 2014); due to this, L. pedicellatus remain in the water column for 24–48 h, making them more likely to recolonise the same site compared to T. navalis (Borges et al., 2010).

This method aids in minimising larval mortality and the risk of being carried to unfavourable environments.

After settlement, Teredinidae larvae metamorphose, and the development of a shell covered in serrated teeth enables them to bore, and tunnel formation begins (Quayle, 1992; Lippert et al., 2017).

Within these tunnels, Teredinidae grow and consume wood for the duration of their lives, however, survival and growth of Teredinidae is linked to the availability of wood, thus rapid settlement and growth are vital to survival (Cragg et al., 2009; Macintosh et al., 2014) but detrimental to the wood they live within.

PARAGRAPH

Limnoria (Crustacea: Isopoda) have a worldwide distribution with L.lignorum, L.quadripunctata and L.tripunctata abundant in English waters (Jones, 1963).

Limnoria give birth to a small number of live young (Eltringham and Hockley, 1961; Quayle, 1992), providing extended parental care, and enabling a low mortality rate (Mohr, 1959; Thiel, 2003).

The young rapidly mature and begin to bore secondary burrows away from the maternal burrow, forming interconnecting burrows under the surface of the wood (Mohr, 1959; Thiel, 2003).

Due to their limited swimming capabilities Limnoria can only migrate over short distances, and as a result develop large, rapidly growing aggregations that aggressively attack wood until depletion (Mohr, 1959, Thiel, 2003).

The burrows destroy the wood's original surface area, and as weakened wood breaks away, Limnoria burrow deeper, eventually depleting the wood volume.

PARAGRAPH

The marine amphipod, Chelura terebans, is found in association with Limnoria and has a preference for pre-softened wood, in which they bore to enlarge Limnoria burrows (Poore et al., 2002; Green Etxabe, 2013).

Independently, C.terebans is not a major concern, mainly because they rely on wood for shelter rather than nutrition (Green Etxabe, 2013); however the concerning factor is C. terebans' ability to worsen the damage made by Limnoria.

PARAGRAPH

Teredinidae, Limnoria and C. terebans are affected by differences in the marine environment, thus varying environmental conditions can affect the rate of biodegradation (Florian et al., 1977).

Temperature and salinity are dominant factors affecting distribution, growth and reproduction of marine wood borers (Eltringham and Hockley, 1961; Nair and Saraswathy, 1971; Appelqvist et al., 2015).

T. navalis has a broad tolerance to temperature and salinity, allowing a long spawning season in English waters and the ability to settle in diverse habitats; whilst L. pedicellatus shares similar temperature tolerances, their salinity tolerance limits them to marine sites (Table 1), (Nair and Saraswathy, 1971; Borges et al., 2010; Paalvast and Van der Velde, 2011; Borges, 2014; Borges et al., 2014a; Appelqvist et al., 2015; Appelqvist and Havenhand, 2016; Lippert et al., 2017; Fofonoff et al., 2018a).

L.lignorum are suited to salinities in brackish and marine waters, and a preference for cooler temperatures allows them to reproduce throughout most of the year, with a wide distribution across the UK; L.quadripunctata and L.tripunctata are restricted to warmer marine waters, and thus limited to the south of England (Table 1), (Jones, 1963; Borges et al., 2010; Borges et al., 2014b; Fofonoff et al., 2018b).

Temperature preferences may also affect depth distribution; Limnoria are abundant in shallow waters, living in the intertidal range to 30 m (Cookson, 1991; Shalaeva, 2012), however, the depth distribution for C. terebans is unknown, but it is active in warmer shallow waters down to at least 12 m (unpublished results).

Similarly, T. navalis has a depth range down to 150 m but is more abundant and destructive in shallower waters down to 20 m (Bernard et al., 1993; Elam, 2009).

Thus, most shallow sites lying within optimum temperature ranges, such as the majority of wooden protected wreck sites along the south coast of England (Historic England, 2018), are at risk of biodegradation.

PARAGRAPH

Dissolved oxygen is a dominant factor controlling the distribution and survival of marine wood borers (Menzies et al., 1963; Anderson and Reish, 1967; Eriksen et al., 2014), and should be considered alongside sediment type and coverage, which can create anoxic conditions and affect larval settlement; hence, studies have successfully trialled various reburial methods of wooden UCH, aiming to produce anoxic conditions for in situ preservation (Gregory, 1998; Palma, 2005; Curci, 2006; Manders, 2006; Björdal and Nilsson, 2008; Palma and Parham, 2009; Eriksen et al., 2014).

Other factors for consideration are the availability of wood and competition for space, particularly with sessile fouling species (Weiss, 1948; Quayle, 1992), water movements, which although may aid larval settlement and burrow oxygenation, can also have opposing effects (Doochin and Smith, 1951), and the wood type and direction of cut (Eriksen et al., 2016).

Marine wood borers have a preference to non-durable wood (Sivrikaya et al., 2009), but studies have shown Teredinidae prefer wood cut on the radial plane, which is common on clinker built boats such as the Skuldelev ships, Bremen cog and Grace Deiu, where timber was radially split for construction (Crumlin-Pedersen, 1984; Litwin, 1998; Childs, 2009; Eriksen et al., 2016).

PARAGRAPH

New UCH sites are found each year, and with minimal funds and resources for excavation, there has been a shift in the way UCH is managed (Manders et al., 2009, 180; Eriksen et al., 2015), hence European and international conventions (Valetta Treaty, 1992; ICOMOS, Charter, 1996; UNESCO Convention, 2001) now recommend that long term in situ preservation of UCH should be considered the first option over excavation.

In line with these policies, a number of projects (MoSS, 2003), Wreck Protect (Manders, 2011), SASMAP (Manders and Gregory, 2015a, 2015b) have developed methods for monitoring and in situ preservation in different environments; additionally, some of these projects have highlighted that severity of attack by marine wood borers is dependent on environmental conditions.

Thus, for in situ protection to work, an understanding of the behaviour of marine boring species in different environments is needed, with a strong understanding of site conditions to ensure conducive recommendations for the most constructive and cost effective methods.

Furthermore, with numerous UCH sites requiring support, and limited time and funding, this information could allow for easy identification of high risk sites, so support and funding can be prioritised without risking further degradation.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the rate of biodegradation in relation to species abundance across four sites with varying environmental conditions; this would allow for the identification of key conditions which affect the rate of biodegradation and the identification of potentially high risk sites in comparison to low risk sites.

SECTION

Method

PARAGRAPH

Three test panels of elm (Ulmus.sp.),

oak (Quercus.sp.)

and pine (P.sylvestris) (timber identification pers.

comm), (total nine panels) sized 200 × 75 × 25 mm, in accordance with EN275 (1992) standards, were placed across four shipwreck sites in the English Channel (Fig. 1).

Test panels were cut tangentially using a band saw; however, archaeological wood would have been prepared differently with axes, adzes and hand saws and would be radially split for clinker built boats or tangentially sawn for carvel built boats (Crumlin-Pedersen, 1984; Childs, 2009).

Nonetheless, deployment of these test panels has given an indication into biodegradation on these sites and the species present.

SECTION

Test panel deployment

PARAGRAPH

Test panels were deployed on the London and HMS Invincible for six months throughout the summer of 2016; there was a limited window for deployment and retrieval on the other sites, thus test panels were deployed for four months on Poole Cannon Site and five months on the West Bay Wreck (Table 2).

To ensure the test panels were faced with the same environmental conditions as the archaeological timber on the sites, they were tied in direct contact with the wreck's exposed timber structure, on the seabed, with polypropylene rope and cable ties.

Where possible a handheld YSI Pro 30 conductivity and salinity meter was used to collect temperature and salinity data at seabed level, where not possible, temperatures were recorded using the diver's computer (Table 2).

SECTION

Laboratory analysis

PARAGRAPH

Each test panel was observed using a Brunel BMDZ Stereomicroscope with a magnification of ×7.5 to ×45, and every specimen on the surface of the test panel was recorded.

Although fouling species were not the primary focus of the study, some sessile fouling species reduce available space and damage the timber surface (Bowens, 2009); thus, species that posed these issues were recorded.

Limnoria were identified using identification keys and illustrations provided by Menzies (1957) and Castello (2011), and sex and maturity level were observed.

Teredinidae were identified by the number of boreholes; it was recorded if the borehole was a result of a failed larval settlement through the presence of an empty, spherical depression or if the specimen had been successful and a calcareous structure or tunnel present; from this a percentage of successful settlement was calculated.

On completion of X-Radiography, Teredinidae pallets were collected and identified using identification keys and illustrations created by Turner (1966, 1971).

When pallets were identified, the tunnel length of the individual was recorded by pushing flexi wire through the tunnel.

SECTION

Surface area analysis

PARAGRAPH

Surface area loss attributed to Limnoria, C. terebans and fouling species was assessed using a CAD software programme, Rhino 3D 5.0, developed by Robert McNeel & Associates.

The Rhino 3D 5.0 software contains multiple functions which records 2D and 3D measurements with high accuracy.

Test panels were photographed on each face using a quadropod; the images were then uploaded to the software and scaled.

Using the ‘interpolated curve’ command function, the outline of each ventilation hole, individual tunnel, group of tunnels or fouling species could be traced (Fig. 2); by applying the ‘patch’ command function, the software fits a patch surface between the traced outline made by the ‘interpolated curve’ and calculates the surface area (Fig. 2).

Percentage of surface area loss attributed to Limnoria and C. terebans was aligned with the EN275 (1992) grading system, (Fig. 3), allowing results to be comparable to other studies (Camidge, 2009; Palma and Parham, 2009; Borges, 2014; Palanti et al., 2015).

Teredinidae damage that could be identified by the X-Ray image, was graded using EN275 (1992), (Fig. 3), however, as heavy colonisation on the test panels made it hard to identify individual tunnels and determine an accurate percentage using Rhino 3D 5.0, a visual estimate was given using a 1 cm2 Perspex grid.

The grid was placed over the X-ray image, and areas of colonisation could be shaded and an estimated percentage of surface area calculated.

SECTION

X-radiography and volume analysis

PARAGRAPH

To confirm the abundance of Teredinidae and calculate the volume of wood lost, test panels were X-rayed using a Gulmay HS 225 kV Hi Stability X-ray system for the London and HMS Invincible test panels and a Faxitron 43,804 N for the Poole Cannon Site and West Bay test panels.

Each X-ray was completed at 50–70 kV over 90–120 s, depending on the test panel density; 180 × 240 mm AGFA Structurix D4 film was used with a Fe filter plate on one side.

Teredinidae specimens were identified on the X-ray by the presence of its shell and calcareous lining, both of which are highly apparent via X-ray (Fig. 4).

Where possible the length and volume of each specimen were determined using Rhino 3D 5.0; by using the ‘interpolated curve’ command function, a line could be placed lengthways down the centre of each specimen's tunnel, from which the software calculates the tunnel length (Fig. 4), (Knight, 2018).

Using the ‘pipe’ command function, several radiuses were extended from the central line; this allows the software to create a 3D mesh replica of the shipworm tunnel and calculates the tunnel volume (Fig. 4), (Knight, 2018).

Due to difficulties in the identification of individual tunnels on HMS Invincible, this method was only employed on X-rays from Poole Cannon Site.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Statistical analysis was completed using the statistical software programme, SPSS, through which, one-way ANOVA tests were completed to identify if a significant difference was present between two or more independent groups.

The level of significance was set at p = 0.05.

The use of one way ANOVA tests allows for multiple variables such as mean abundance of Limnoria on pine test panels across all 4 sites to be compared.

When these factors were tested using one way ANOVA, a result of statistical significance was produced; if the result was p ≤ 0.05, a statistically significant difference was present.

When a statistically significant difference was identified, the null hypothesis was rejected and Tukey HSD post hoc comparison tests were completed to identify which groups within the sample group were significantly different.

For example, the Tukey HSD post hoc results highlighted that, when testing the difference in mean abundance of Limnoria on pine test panels, a highly significant difference was evident between the London and HMS Invincible, with a result less than p = 0.05 (Table 3), suggesting the abundance of Limnoria between these sites is very different; whilst no significant difference was identified between the London and West Bay wreck with a result greater than p = 0.05, suggesting little to no variation in mean abundance of Limnoria between these sites (Table 3).

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

Upon recovery test panels from the London were covered in silt sediment, with some shallow, singular Limnoria burrows (Fig. 4) and very minimal surface coverage from fouling species.

Test panels from HMS Invincible and Poole Cannon Site were recovered with no sediment coverage and varying levels of biodegradation, with the presence of Limnoria, C. terebans and Teredinidae in large numbers, and some surface coverage from fouling species (Fig. 5).

Unfortunately, oak test panels from Poole Cannon Site were lost during the study and no results are reflected below.

Test panels from the West Bay Wreck were covered in a thin layer of sediment, however, no damage from wood borers was evident and the presence of fouling species was pronounced (Fig. 5).

SECTION

Limnoria and C. terebans

PARAGRAPH

Whilst no evidence of Limnoria or C. terebans was found on West Bay, vestigial evidence of Limnoria was found on the London (Table 4).

During one way ANOVA tests the mean abundance of Limnoria and C. terebans across all sites produced highly significant results (with the exception of the mean abundance of C. terebans on elm test panels, from which no specimens were collected) (Table 4); thus Tukey HSD post hoc comparisons were completed to identify which sites were significantly different from each other (Table 3).

The Tukey HSD post hoc comparison results comparing mean abundance of Limnoria and C. terebans on the London and West Bay sites produced a p value >0.05 (Table 3), indicating no significant differences between the London and West Bay, hence mean abundance of Limnoria and C. terebans on these sites shows little to no variation.

Similar results showing no significant differences or little to no variation were observed when analysing mean abundance of C. terebans on pine test panels, between Poole Cannon Site, and the London and West Bay sites (Table 3).

However, relationships between the remaining sites were significant with a p value <0.05, suggesting the abundance of Limnoria and C. terebans on test panels across these sites varies significantly (Table 3), with the highest mean abundance of Limnoria and C. terebans identified on HMS Invincible for all test panels (Table 4).

L.quadripunctata was identified on every test panel on HMS Invincible however, no C. terebans was collected from elm test panels and a clear preference to pine was observed (Table 4, Fig. 6).

On Poole Cannon Site, L.quadripunctata were the dominant species found on all test panels, whilst L.lignorum, were only found on pine making up 9% of the species composition (Fig. 6).

Further comparisons between test panel material and mean abundance of Limnoria and C. terebans using one way ANOVA tests indicated another highly significant difference with a p value <0.05 (Table 5); Tukey HSD Post hoc comparisons identified a significant difference in species abundance between pine and elm test panels, with both Limnoria (p = 0.035) and C. terebans (p = 0.002) showing a clear preference for pine.

SECTION

Teredinidae

PARAGRAPH

No Teredinidae presence was identified on any of the test panels from West Bay, and whilst boreholes were identified on all test panels from the London, these appeared to be failed larval attempts (Table 4).

One way ANOVA tests were completed to understand if the mean total number of boreholes or mean number of successful boreholes varied based on test panel material, however no significant differences were observed (Table 5) and so the null hypothesis was accepted and no further analysis completed.

However, one way ANOVA tests did highlight a significant difference when comparing the mean number of total boreholes and mean number of successful boreholes between the different sites, on pine test panels (Table 4).

As a result Tukey HSD post hoc comparisons were completed and identified a significant difference in both the mean number of total boreholes and mean number of successful boreholes on pine test panels between HMS Invincible and the other sites, with p values <0.05 (Table 3); thus indicating the mean number of total boreholes and mean number of successful boreholes on HMS Invincible was greatly different to the other sites.

HMS Invincible had the highest mean number of total boreholes and mean number of successful specimens, with a settlement success rate of 61% on pine test panels, 55% on oak and 13% on elm (Table 4).

Both L. pedicellatus and T. navalis were identified on HMS Invincible, however, the T. navalis specimens identified were <5 mm in length, and although they were far from a rare occurrence, L. pedicellatus were the dominant species in size and abundance.

All Teredinidae specimens identified on Poole Cannon Site were T. navalis and a mean settlement success of 56% was observed on pine test panels and 77% on elm (Table 4).

SECTION

Severity of degradation

PARAGRAPH

One way ANOVA tests were completed to analyse the relationship between mean total surface area loss on the different test panel materials over the different sites, with results showing a significant difference between the sites on pine and oak test panels with a result p ≤0.05 (Table 6).

Tukey HSD post hoc comparisons were completed and indicated a significant difference in mean total surface area loss on pine test panels between HMS Invincible and the remaining sites, however no significant differences at p ≤0.05 were observed for oak test panels across any of the sites (Table 7).

PARAGRAPH

Further one way ANOVA tests were completed to analyse the relationship between mean surface area loss attributed to Limnoria and C. terebans, on the different test panel materials, over the different sites, with results showing a significant difference on oak and pine test panels between sites (Table 6).

Tukey HSD post hoc comparison tests indicated a significant difference on pine test panels between HMS Invincible and the remaining sites (Table 7); a further difference was observed on oak test panels between HMS Invincible, and the London and West Bay sites (Table 7), hence, mean surface area loss on HMS Invincible due to Limnoria and C. terebans is dissimilar when compared to the other sites, and likely due to the significant differences observed in the mean abundance of Limnoria and C. terebans.

Finally, one way ANOVA tests were completed to analyse the relationship between mean surface area loss attributed to fouling species, on the different test panel materials, over the different sites, with results showing a significant difference on pine test panels between the sites (Table 6).

Tukey HSD post hoc comparisons were completed and identified a significant difference between the London and West Bay sites (Table 7).

PARAGRAPH

Test panels recovered from the London had the lowest mean total surface area loss, with fouling species responsible for <1%, and Limnoria responsible for 0.05% of the mean surface area loss on pine test panels (Table 6), (Fig. 7).

In contrast, HMS Invincible had the highest mean total surface area loss, with fouling species responsible for under 2% of mean surface area loss across all test panels; Limnoria and C. terebans were responsible for 8.02% loss on elm test panels, 13.62% on oak and 17.26% on pine (Table 6), (Fig. 7).

Whilst Limnoria and C. terebans were responsible for the highest percentage of mean surface area loss on pine test panels across all sites (excluding West Bay), fouling species showed a preference towards hardwoods and were responsible for the highest percentage of mean surface area loss on elm test panels across all sites (Table 6).

PARAGRAPH

An average monthly rate of degradation was assigned for fair comparison due to the varying lengths of deployment between the sites.

Nonetheless, results continued to follow a similar trend, though some differences were noted in that, mean surface area loss caused by fouling species on Poole Cannon Site was more prominent, with fouling coverage on elm test panels being higher than HMS Invincible, and surface area loss due to fouling on pine test panels was closer to HMS Invincible than previously recorded (Fig. 8).

These results were to be expected as the protruding structure and crevices on the Poole Cannon Site traps drift material, allowing rapid colonisation of fouling species and the development of a growing reef structure, whilst a large structure of this sort is less evident on HMS Invincible.

Likewise, it was expected the West Bay results would maintain the highest fouling cover due to its location next to a well-developed rocky reef with an abundance of fouling species.

PARAGRAPH

Tunnel lengths and volumes of T. navalis were recorded using Rhino 3D 5.0 on the Poole Cannon Site; however the method could not be accurately used on HMS Invincible due to heavy colonisation.

Analysis of the tunnel lengths and volumes of the T. navalis specimens on the Poole Cannon Site showed that T. navalis had a longer tunnel length and volume in elm test panels when compared to pine test panels, with an average tunnel length of 3.98 mm SD 0.81 mm, and a total mean volume loss calculated at 174.46 mm3 SD 82.79 mm3 (0.05%) on pine test panels, and an average tunnel length of 4.56 mm SD 0.03 mm and a total mean volume loss calculated at 736.01 mm3 SD 213.31 mm3 (0.2%) on elm test panels.

Although the analysis of individual tunnels was unsuccessful on HMS Invincible, it was possible to identify the longest tunnel lengths for each species, with L. pedicellatus reaching 30.79 mm on HMS Invincible, and T. navalis reaching 14.62 mm on Poole Cannon Site.

PARAGRAPH

To quantify the damage caused by Limnoria, C. terebans and Teredinidae, and to simplify comparisons with other studies, mean surface area loss percentage was correlated to the grading system under EN275 (1992), (Fig. 3).

Results suggested, on Poole Cannon Site, T. navalis, Limnoria and C. terebans were equally responsible for the degradation, and all test panels were recorded at a grade 1; similarly, the damage caused by Limnoria was graded 1 across all test panels on the London, though the statistical analysis clarifies the differences here.

Whilst the degradation level attributed to L.quadripunctata and C. terebans on oak and elm test panels from HMS Invincible were similar to other sites at grade 1, the mean degradation level on pine test panels was pronounced at 2.33; furthermore, T. navalis and L. pedicellatus were responsible for the majority of the degradation compared to L.quadripunctata and C. terebans on HMS Invincible.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

There are many environmental forces which lead to physical and biological degradation of wooden UCH, and as conditions vary between sites, so does the rate of degradation, thus it is paramount to identify and understand the environmental conditions on individual sites.

Furthermore, the effect of physical forces such as currents and swell can lead to changes in the seabed, creating scour and sediment erosion; in turn this can destabilise a site leaving areas exposed to physical abrasion and biological attack (Muckelroy, 1978; Stewart, 1999; Gregory et al., 2012; Manders, 2017).

Other factors of consideration are depth and sediment; whilst physical forces on shallow sites are more intense, leading to a greater risk of exposure and abrasion (Muckelroy, 1978; Stewart, 1999; Manders, 2017), Muckelroy (1978) identified that the type of sediment was the “main determining factor in the survival of archaeological material”.

Consequently, results from this study indicated sediment type was a key determining factor affecting the rate of biodegradation.

Temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen are significant parameters involved in the survival of wood borers (Eltringham and Hockley, 1961; Nair and Saraswathy, 1971; Appelqvist et al., 2015; Appelqvist and Havenhand, 2016), however profiles within this study remained within optimum ranges for the survival and reproduction of these species (Tables 1 & 2); thus it was evident other factors were involved in the differing rates of biodegradation and species compositions.

PARAGRAPH

HMS Invincible lies in c.7 m on a mobile sand and shingle seabed which periodically expose areas of the wreck, however with strong water currents and sediment reduction, large areas of the wreck are becoming permanently exposed (Pascoe, 2013; Pascoe and Cowan, 2017; Pascoe et al., 2017).

Poole Cannon Site, lies at c.6 m on sand, shell and shingle sediment, but despite strong water currents and a large section of permanently exposed structure, the site appears stable and the formation of a reef occurs rapidly.

In contrast, the London lies at c.20 m on a silt seabed, however scour pockets are increasingly evident and exposure is occurring; whilst elements of the wreck at seabed level are well preserved, elements protruding from the seabed such as the gun carriage raised in 2015, rapidly degrade from biological attack (Evans, 2017).

All of the above sites have an oak built structure, hence is it unlikely that any significant differences in degradation, observed on the structural timbers, is due to wood type, although in some cases, pine and elm have been used for elements such as the keel and cladding (pers comms, Pascoe et al., 2017).

The West Bay site lays c.12 m of water next to a rocky reef on a sand, shell, shingle and silt sediment (Palma, 2010); the site has no remaining wooden structure, and instead is composed of metal remains heavily fouled with sessile fouling species (Palma, 2010).

Results indicated the biggest differences in species abundance and the level of degradation were often between HMS Invincible and Poole Cannon Site in comparison to the London and the West Bay site; of which depth, wood availability and sediment were among the differing factors.

SECTION

Depth

PARAGRAPH

The sites were located within known depth ranges for Limnoria and Teredinidae, who have been observed causing extensive damage to other sites within the English Channel at similar depths (Bernard et al., 1993; Merrett Jones, 2000; Camidge, 2009; Elam, 2009; Shalaeva, 2012).

Results from this study indicated a divide between deeper and shallower sites, however no correlation with depth was observed when other studies were considered (Merrett Jones, 2000; Camidge, 2009); studies completed on Mary Rose (18 m), HMS Hazardous (7 m) and HMS Invincible (7 m) showed extensive wood borer abundance and biodegradation; however, damage was more extensive on Mary Rose and HMS Invincible with results indicating the differences in biodegradation and species composition were due to the water quality surrounding these sites, not depth (Merrett Jones, 2000).

Results from HMS Colossus (15 m) were comparable to Poole Cannon Site and graded 1 after 5 months of exposure (Camidge, 2009).

Thus depth is unlikely to be a key factor controlling species abundance and biodegradation; nonetheless, due to dynamic conditions on shallow sites, depth should be considered when assessing the risk of physical factors which lead to exposure and biodegradation (Muckelroy, 1978; Stewart, 1999; Manders, 2017).

SECTION

Availability of wood and local populations

PARAGRAPH

The survival of wood boring species is linked to the availability of wood hence; sites with exposed wooden remains are at risk (Cragg et al., 2009; Macintosh et al., 2014).

However, consideration should be given to wooden UCH sites which are at risk of colonisation due to its ‘proximity’ to a colonised site, although, in this case, the term ‘proximity’ should be used rather loosely.

Put simply, does the speed and direction of the tidal current allow the species on a colonised site, to travel with the current to reach and colonise another site within a limited time window.

All marine wood borers have limitations in terms of the distance they are able to cover in a certain time, for example Lyrodus pedicellatus spends 24–48 h in the water column before it needs to settle and metamorphose, whilst Teredo navalis spends up to 34 days in the water column (Borges et al., 2010; Appelqvist et al., 2015), hence the tidal speed and distance they cover in this time is important to understanding if other sites lie within this ‘proximity’ and therefore at risk.

Furthermore, as the survival of wood borers is linked to the availability of wood, the migration to new sites allows their continued survival even once their original wood source has been depleted.

The West Bay wreck was chosen as it contains no remaining wooden structure for wood borers to inhabit, and no known wooden sites were present in the direction of the tidal stream around the site, within a 24 h window.

In comparison the remaining sites have vast amounts of exposed wooden structure, and multiple colonised sites lie in the direction of several overlapping tidal streams, within a 24 h window, making the colonisation of large populations more likely.

Results indicated the availability of wood and a local infestation source was a determining factor in the abundance of marine wood borers; no evidence of wood borers were found on the West Bay wreck but a large population of Limnoria, C. terbans and Teredinidae were present on HMS Invincible and Poole Cannon Site (Table 4).

On both HMS Invincible and Poole Cannon Site the spread of wood borers to local sites is facilitated through currents and drift material, and with the use of environmental cues and chemoreception, they detect the presence of wood and conspecifics, allowing them to establish new populations rapidly (Cragg et al., 1999; Toth et al., 2015).

Hence the risk of high population abundances and rapid biodegradation is high in areas with multiple colonised sites and available exposed wood.

Despite a vast wooden structure and the locality of other colonised sites, only vestigial evidence of marine wood borers were found on the London, thus it is likely that although they were active in the vicinity, a further factor has impeded their survival (Table 5).

Wood type

PARAGRAPH

Whilst Limnoria and C. terebans preferred pine test panels, results indicated Teredinidae were less selective and no relationships were observed between the total number of boreholes or successful boreholes in relation to wood type (Table 5).

This is likely due to their life history strategies; Teredinidae are opportunistic with a limited window to locate a suitable substrate in their larval form (Appelqvist et al., 2015; Lippert et al., 2017), thus they cannot be overly selective and using chemical cues to determine a suitable location near conspecifics with available space is likely prioritised (Toth et al., 2015); this behaviour may explain results seen on Poole Cannon Site where a higher number of total boreholes were identified on elm test panels (Table 4).

On the other hand, Limnoria and C. terebans are born into a protective environment and have the ability to migrate in search of substrate material and, move at will when conditions become unfavourable (Mohr, 1959; Cragg et al., 1999; Poore et al., 2002; Thiel, 2003; Green Etxabe, 2013); this is evident on the London where borings were present but no abundance of Limnoria was found, thus Limnoria likely migrated when sediment coverage occurred.

Fouling species showed a preference to hardwoods and were responsible for the highest mean surface area loss on elm test panels across all sites (Fig. 7), this is potentially due to the need for a hard substrate with a stable base to adhere to; this would appear to be a sensible choice due to Limnoria and C. terebans' preference to the pine test panels which lost 46% more surface area compared to the elm test panels.

Hence, UCH sites with exposed pine elements such as the pine clad orlop deck found on HMS Invincible (Pascoe et al., 2017) should be considered high risk.

SECTION

Sediment

PARAGRAPH

Sediment type appeared to be a key factor controlling biodegradation and the abundance of marine wood boring and fouling species.

Muckelroy (1978), Ward et al. (1999) and Wheeler (2002), hypothesised that fine, soft sediments such as silt, compact tightly together creating anoxic conditions, even with minimal sediment coverage; whilst coarse sediments such as gravel cannot, and so dissolved oxygen moves between the sediment particles, enriching deeper layers.

Thus, minimal or shallow sediment coverage provides little to no protection on sites with coarse sediments and only articles buried far deeper in these environments have a chance of survival.

Dissolved oxygen is a dominant factor in the survival of marine wood boring and fouling species and subsequently, the survival of archaeological material.

As a result, the reburial of UCH is considered an effective means of in situ protection, with studies indicating a minimum coverage depth of 50 cm is needed to reduce dissolved oxygen enough to impede the survival of wood degrading species (Gregory, 1998; Palma, 2005; Curci, 2006; Manders, 2006; Björdal and Nilsson, 2008; Palma and Parham, 2009).

The London had the lowest species abundance and biodegradation of all sites (Fig. 7), (Table 6) with only vestigial evidence of Limnoria and Teredinidae identified.

Hence, it is highly likely the silt sediment covering the test panels reduced the dissolved oxygen levels, which consequently, impeded the survival of the wood boring and fouling species.

In comparison with other sites, the relationship between sediment type and its ability to effect dissolved oxygen is commonly observed; the Mary Rose (Quinn et al., 1997), (prior to excavations) and the Vasa (Cederlund and Hocker, 2006), buried in soft sediments like the London (Evans, 2017), have produced incredibly well preserved remains, whilst sites such as HMS Colossus (Camidge, 2009), Swash Channel Wreck (Palma and Parham, 2006), and HMS Invincible are offered little protection from coarse sediments, and biodegradation is extensive.

Conclusion

Future site management

PARAGRAPH

Despite limitations, the results provide an insight into the biodegradation occurring on each of the sites which can be applied to future management plans.

HMS Invincible and the London are both on the Heritage at Risk Register due to highly dynamic and unstable site conditions, leading to the loss of historically important.

As a result, both sites have undergone several excavations to retrieve at risk artefacts and regular monitoring is undertaken.

Whilst UNESCO's (2001) recommendation is that in situ preservation should be considered the first option over excavation, it is simply not a viable option for these sites, and despite in situ protection, scour, erosion and the loss of material is highly evident (pers comm).

Results from this study highlight a stark difference in the rate biodegradation occurring on the sites, and whilst it is fair to argue HMS Invincible is the higher priority site, this does not mean the London should not be considered high priority.

Whilst it is clear HMS Invincible is at high risk of biodegradation, the environmental conditions which act upon the site are uncontrollable and expose the site to further biological and physical degradation.

Whilst in situ protection may slow the rate of degradation, exposure of the ship's structure will continue to occur, losing about 2% of its surface area per month.

Hence, the recording and survey work produced as a result of the excavation allowed for the structure and construction method of HMS Invincible, which has made her so historically important; to be recorded and understood before it is lost.

The London, despite a lack of evidence in this study to suggest it is at risk of biological degradation, is at risk due to other elements, namely the dynamic physical conditions acting upon the site; the passing of large ships and dredging activities, alongside strong water movements result in sporadic exposure and the mobilisation and dispersal of sediment and artefacts.

Although results from this study indicated that the sediment offers protection from wood boring species, the wood borer damage to the exposed gun carriage raised in 2015 is a stark reminder of what can occur on this site when sediment movement produces long term exposure and allows for wood borer settlement.

Hence, funding should be prioritised for both these sites to enable continued monitoring, recovery and conservation for at risk artefacts and in situ protection where possible.

The Poole Cannon Site is not protected; however it does highlight the need for continued monitoring and in situ preservation on stable sites, and illustrates the potential for oxygen to penetrate coarse sediments, allowing for biodegradation.

As a result, sites in similar conditions to Poole Cannon Site should be regularly monitored especially as being shallow with coarse sediments, puts them at risk during events such as storms, which can lead to exposure and biodegradation.

Additionally, the West Bay site gave promise that wood borers are not active everywhere and, in areas with a lack of wooden material, populations have declined, thus the continued use of in situ preservation to limit exposed wooden material is recommended.

Nonetheless, it was clear the presence of fouling species ultimately results in a heavy loss of original surface area.

Currently, the West Bay wreck is protected due to the presence of a bronze gun, however, regular monitoring is confirming the surface detail on the gun is being lost due to the colonisation of fouling species; and so, aside from recording and survey, recovery or in situ protection may be the only way to protect the information (pers comm).

Further research

PARAGRAPH

The study highlighted key factors for consideration in regard to the rate of biodegradation on wooden UCH caused by marine wood borers; however, in light of the short deployment period, small number of test panels, and small number of sites and environments, further work should be completed to ascertain a more comprehensive dataset where a variety of variables can be tested.

PARAGRAPH

To develop upon the key limitations, a larger selection of wreck sites and environments need to be utilised, with a wider coverage along the south coast of England.

Furthermore, the number of test panels needs to be increased, and the deployment time should be extended over 12, 18 and 24 months; not only should this help to encase a wider variety of environments and conditions for comparison, a larger number of test panels should provide a larger data set for stronger statistical analysis.

Additionally, a longer study should allow for seasonal comparison and better understanding of wood borer behaviours.

PARAGRAPH

Further research should be completed in regard to some of the factors highlighted throughout the study.

Although it was interesting to note that depth did not appear to be a key factor controlling biodegradation, all sites within the study, and those identified as case studies were located within the preferred depth range of wood boring species, and therefore may account for the lack of significant differences observed; hence, a study incorporating a larger variety of depths, including those deeper than 30 m, should provide clarification on the role of depth in species abundance and biodegradation.

PARAGRAPH

Whilst it was evident Limnoria and C. terebans had a preference to pine test panels, results indicated Teredinidae were less selective when it came to wood type and no significant differences were noticed between the soft and hardwoods.

Although this may be due to their life history strategy, laboratory research using a variety of wood types and cuts could identify if a preference is present and would expand upon research completed by Eriksen et al. (2016).

PARAGRAPH

Sediment type and coverage proved to be a significant factor for the survival of wooden material, and highlighted sites with compact soft sediment coverage were considered low risk to biodegradation, whilst sites with coarse, shallow, mobile sediments, which leave the site exposed to physical and biological degradation were considered high risk, hence measures for in situ protection should be applied immediately to prevent the loss of original material.

Nonetheless, further research should aid in emulating a stronger understanding of sediment conditions on sites, and research should focus towards testing a wider range of sites with varying sediments.

It may prove worthwhile placing control panels in the water column to provide comparison between those at seabed and those buried at selected depths to better understand the effect and level of protection the sediment is able to offer.

PARAGRAPH

Finally, amendments to the method could be made if sufficient funding could be obtained; the use of X-ray is an inherently easy method of observing the presence and damage caused by Teredinids.

However, as a 2D image, X-ray has its limitations, and whilst CAD software programmes can be utilised to create 3D structures from this image with impressive accuracy, the use of CT scanning may provide far more accurate results.

Ultimately, the use of X-ray and CAD failed during this study when the level of colonisation became so heavy that individual tunnels could not be separated from a 2D image alone, and as such, CT scans may be more apt at separating individual tunnels and calculating more accurate 3D measurements, even when colonisation is high.

PARAGRAPH

Results produced throughout this study have not only highlighted the need for continued monitoring of all historically important sites, regardless of environmental conditions and stability, but have also determined sediment type and coverage as a significant factor for the survival of wooden material.

Thus sites with compact soft sediment coverage should be considered low risk to biodegradation, whilst sites with coarse, shallow, mobile sediments, which leave the site exposed to physical and biological degradation should considered high risk, and measures for in situ protection should be applied immediately to prevent the loss of original material, although in many cases, the recovery of at risk artefacts and excavation may be the only option for preservation.

Furthermore, in light of some of the limitations to the study, further research focusing on single variables can aid in formulating a more comprehensive dataset which can aid in the protection of our UCH.
