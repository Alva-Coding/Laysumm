TITLE

The archaeometric identification of the marbles of the Roman shipwrecks of Capo Granitola (TP), Isola delle Correnti and Marzamemi I (SR)

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Aim of this article is to present the final results of the archaeometric analysis made on the samples of marble taken from three shipwreck cargos, of Roman age sunk along the Sicilian coasts, investigated by a team of the Dipartimento di Studi Umanistici of the Ca' Foscari University of Venice, directed by C. Beltrame, in collaboration with the L.A.M.A. (Laboratory for the study of ancient materials) of the University Iuav of Venice.

This study is part of the ‘The Routes of the Marble’ project whose broader aim is the reconstruction of the routes travelled by the ships transporting marble in the Roman period through the analysis of the marble traded, including the evaluation of the practical problems of this special transportation and the characteristics of these special ships.

PARAGRAPH

It is established, that the archaeometric analysis of the marbles is the best scientific approach for the determination of the sea routes followed by the wrecked ships and possibly also of the final destiny/use of the stone itself.

That is why a project of systematic study of the marbles, belonging to the known shipwrecks of southern Italy and Sicily, has been started in 2011 and has already been completed for the cargoes of Secca di Capo Bianco and Punta Scifo D (Beltrame et al., 2012; Beltrame et al., 2014) off the Crotone area (South Italy).

PARAGRAPH

Since 2014, the team coordinated by C. Beltrame, in collaboration with the Sicilian Soprintendenza del Mare, has been doing archaeological research on the Sicilian shipwrecks of Marzamemi (I), Isola delle Correnti and Capo Granitola (Fig. 1).

Each site was documented with automatic photogrammetry which allows to produce very precise 3D models of the cargoes (Balletti et al., 2016), and each marble item was sampled for systematic archaeometrical analysis.

The method used is quite original since in other published studies there exist very few cases of systematic, extensive sampling and analysis.1

SECTION

The shipwrecks

PARAGRAPH

The Marzamemi I site is 1 mile off the village of Marzamemi; identified for the first time by Paolo Orsi in 1913 (Tusa, 2015, 833), it was investigated by Gerhard Kapitaen in 1959 (Kapitaen, 1961).

The site is composed of a cluster of three presumed large semi-finished columns (nos. 1, 2 and 3), almost 6 m long, four large square blocks and three small blocks.

Two other small blocks and a large column (no. 11), 6.4 m long, lie about 15 m from the main cluster; another presumed column is 32 m away (Fig. 2).

The total weight of the cargo is around 153 tons (Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

The discovery of fragments of amphoras Kapitaen I and II suggested Kapitaen (1961) dating the ship to the 3rd century CE, with a possible provenance from the East.

PARAGRAPH

The shipwreck of Capo Granitola was found in 1976 by Pietro Compagno, who showed it to Gianfranco Purpura.

The site is located 120 m from the shore south of Torretta Granitola, 5.5 nautical miles south-east of Mazara del Vallo.

In Purpura's (1977) preliminary publication, the site is dated to the 3rd century CE because of the finding of a fragment of Kapitaen II amphora.

A few samples of the marble were soon after analysed with petrographic and chemical methods (determination of the Ca/Sr ratio) by Lazzarini (1980a: 40–45), resulting made of Proconnesian marble.

PARAGRAPH

The cargo is composed of 54 semi-finished marble blocks covering an area of 20 × 15 m, and partially overlapping.

The blocks are aligned in lines in a quite coherent arrangement, but many of them are broken.

Apart from these blocks, three marble moulded bases (Fig. 3) were found on the south part of the site, some of which associated with “pebbles”, which may be interpreted either as residues of previous cargos, or as ballast, or, less probably, as fragments of thin slabs.

The total weight of the cargo is very similar to that of Marzamemi, about 155–160 tons (Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

The third shipwreck lies about 500 m offshore, west of Isola delle Correnti and south of Punta delle Formiche, close to the village of Porto Palo.

The site was investigated in 1959 by Gerhard Kapitaen (1961) who could document a quite coherent cargo of about 25 rectangular semi-finished marble blocks settled in four lines and with partial overlapping.

Also two fragments of two probably distinct slabs of marble were found among the blocks.

PARAGRAPH

The situation on the site that we documented in 2015 is very different from what was documented in 1959.

At the centre of the site, indeed, there is a large gap created by the illegal removal of ten large blocks (Fig. 4).

Adding the supposed 110 tons of the looted blocks to the surviving blocks, we can calculate a total tonnage of 335 tons (Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

According to our new interpretation of a fragment of an “Africana” Type 2 amphora as an undertype A, would indicate a dating between the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, confirmed by our discovery of a fragment of a domestic Aegean jug, dated to the first three centuries of the Christian era or later.

Archaeometric analyses

PARAGRAPH

The shipwrecked marbles were analysed by T. Percic and L. Lazzarini at the LAMA, Laboratory for the Analysis of Ancient Materials of the University Iuav of Venice.

PARAGRAPH

The sampling was carried out by the team of Ca' Foscari with hammer and chisel from sound marbles areas as much as possible free from deposits of marine organisms.

In total, 96 marble samples from the three examined shipwrecks were analysed (Table 2).

PARAGRAPH

In this study all determinations were generally made on a single fragment of ca. 3 × 2 × 1 cm.

Part of the sample was finely ground and the powder subjected to the mentioned diffractometric and isotopic analyses.

The remaining part was used for the preparation of a thin section for the minero-petrographic study of the marble under a polarizing microscope (see further).

PARAGRAPH

All samples were first mechanically cleaned from marine concretions, then carefully washed and desalinized in running and deionized water.

Once dried, a small, well preserved portion of each sample was finely powdered in an agate mortar and the powder subjected to X-ray diffraction analysis (Radiation CuKα at 40 kV, 20 mA – instrument: PANalytical Empyrean) and isotopic analyses.

The remaining and larger part was used to prepare a thin section for a detailed minero-petrographic study of the marble under a polarizing microscope (LEITZ DM RXP).

The X-ray standard diffractometric analysis was fundamental for determining the presence and abundance of calcite (CaCO3), and eventually of dolomite CaMg(CO3)2, the main minerals of pure marbles: this datum was also useful for the choice of the running time of acid attack for the following determination of the C & O stable isotopes ratio.

PARAGRAPH

This archaeometric approach was selected according to the literature that suggests that the best provenancing method consists in combining the isotopic analysis of C and O with the detailed minero-petrographic study of thin section of the marbles (Antonelli and Lazzarini, 2015).

PARAGRAPH

To confirm the provenience in a few cases it has been necessary to determine also the quantitative chemical analysis of trace elements by XRF analysis at the Department of Geoscience of University of Padova.

Particular care has been devoted to measure the amount of Sr that may differentiate fine grained marbles namely fine grained Proconnesian and Carrara marble from the very similar Göktepe marble.

SECTION

Minero-petrographic analyses

PARAGRAPH

Minero-petrographic analysis are historically of fundamental importance to characterise marbles and determine their genesis, e.g. type of metamorphism (burial, contact, regional) and grade (low, medium, high).

While a more or less complete characterization is possible for all marbles (from monuments and quarries), the petrological determination of their genesis is possible only for quarry samples, and when sampling is made by geologists that may correlate specific geological field studies of the marble outcrops and of quarries.

The limitation in the characterization of marble artefacts is obviously due to the small size of the marble sample that may be taken from them, sometimes not fully representing the marble type.

PARAGRAPH

The purpose of this examination was to determine the fabric, accessory and secondary minerals, in addition to the calcite/dolomite crystal-features which are usually the principal constituents of all types of marble.

PARAGRAPH

Specifically, the following parameters were determined:

type of fabric (homeoblastic = with roughly isodiametric grains, heteroblastic = with grains of various dimensions), in direct relationship with the type (equilibrium, non-equilibrium, retrograde metamorphism, polymetamorphism);

boundary-shapes of the calcite/dolomite grains, also connected to the type of metamorphic event/s that generated the marble;

maximum grain size, a parameter of significant diagnostic importance since it is linked to the grade of metamorphism achieved by the marble.

In the archaeometric research field, according to their grain size, marbles are conventionally divided into fine-grained (up to 2 mm), average-grained (2–5 mm) and coarse-grained (above 5 mm);

qualitative and semi-quantitative presence of accessory minerals, sometimes of diagnostic value.

PARAGRAPH

For the petrographic description, previous specific studies of the most important (“major”) ancient marbles (Lazzarini et al., 1980b; Gorgoni et al., 2002; Antonelli and Lazzarini, 2015), as well as other archaeometric unpublished studies of (“minor”) marbles, and classical treatises on petrotectonics (Spry, 1986; Barker, 1990) were taken into consideration.

SECTION

Isotopic and other geochemical analyses

PARAGRAPH

Since 1957 Craig (1957) isotopic characterization has proved to be very useful in the marble identification of ancient artefacts.

Its use is becoming more and more widespread owing to its outstanding sensitivity, to the small quantity of material necessary for the analysis, and to the availability of a rapidly growing data-base, often associated to other laboratory methodologies (Gorgoni et al., 2002; Attanasio et al., 2006) that permits increasingly trustworthy comparisons, especially if the isotopic data are evaluated together with the minero-petrographic results from the same samples, as in the present study.

PARAGRAPH

The isotopic analyses were carried out on the carbon dioxide derived from small portions (20–30 mg) of the powdered sample subjected to a chemical attack with 100% phosphoric acid at 25° in a special vacuum line, according to the procedure suggested by McCrea (1950) and Craig.

The resulting CO2 was then analysed by mass spectrometry (Finnigan Matt).

The instrument used is endowed with a triple collector and permits the measurement of both isotopic ratios (13C/12C and 18O/16O) at the same time.

The analytical results have been conventionally expressed in δ units, in part per thousand according to the following equation:δ=Rsp−RstdRstd×100=RspRstd−1×1000in which Rsp and Rstd represent the isotopic ratio of oxygen and carbon in the sample and in the reference standard, respectively.

The standard adopted is PDB for both oxygen and carbon [the PDB standard is the rostrum of the fossil Belemnitella americana of the Cretaceous Pee Dee Formation of South Carolina, USA].

PARAGRAPH

The identification of the provenance of the marbles of the three shipwrecks, as said, was obtained by comparing their minero-petrographic and geochemical data with those collected from direct analysis on quarry samples and from the specific literature (Antonelli and Lazzarini, 2015), mainly using the relative reference petrographic tables and isotopic diagram published therein.

PARAGRAPH

For a few samples the combined results were not fully conclusive, in particular there was the possibility of confusing a fine-grained Proconnesian marble with Carrara and Göktepe marbles.

In these cases as specified above, Sr content may help the distinction of these three marble types (Lazzarini et al., 1980b; Poretti et al., 2017): the analysis of the Sr content was made by XRF spectrometry directly on a polished marble sample.

SECTION

Results obtained

PARAGRAPH

From the minero-petrographic and isotopic analysis of marble samples in the cargos resulted a general very large prevalence of Proconnesian marble extracted from the island of Marmara (ancient Proconnesos) in the homonymous sea (island now belonging to Turkey), whose microscopic features are characterized by a heteroblastic fabric with a typical mortar fabric formed by calcite (and less abundant dolomite) crystals (Fig. 5), all with sutured boundaries and often showing strained features such as slightly bent polysynthetic twinning and marked rhombohedral cleavage.

This typical fabric is sometimes coupled with homeoblastic areas, often foliated, and with fine-grained crystals of calcite/dolomite showing curved boundaries (Fig. 6).

The main minerals composing this marble are calcite (usually prevailing) and dolomite (in various amounts, often concentrated in specific levels).

Common accessory minerals are graphite, quartz, K-mica (Fig. 7) and ore minerals (hematite and pyrite) (Fig. 8); less abundant are apatite, chlorite, epidote and titanite (Fig. 8).

PARAGRAPH

As for the presence of dolomite, the exclusive presence of this mineral, emerging from the diffractometric analysis of the powder of numerous marble samples (see Tables 2, 3, 4) found in all the three marble loads, may be due to chance sampling of dolomite levels.

Such levels are in fact probably due to the differential dissolution of calcitic areas (volumetrically prevailing in Proconnesian marble) the water solubility of calcite is very low, 6.6 mg/l (Lide, 2002), with consequent isolation of the much more insoluble dolomitic levels (the water solubility of dolomite is 10–17/−20, Jinghwa Hsu, 1963) that resulting somewhat protruding from the blocks have been more easily sampled.

PARAGRAPH

out of the 14 samples of marble taken from the Marzamemi I shipwreck, 13 blocks are made of Proconnesian marble, and 1 sample (RM 6) seems to be Pentelic marble (Fig. 9) extracted from Mount Penteli, near Athens (Greece), according to the analysis of its thin section (Table 2, Fig. 10).

This hypothesis was confirmed by a second sample, coming from the same block, processed the exact way as the first one;

out of the 26 samples of marble blocks from the wreck of Isola delle Correnti, 24 blocks were made of Proconnesian marble (Fig. 11), and the remaining 2 (RC 2 Rep. and RC 41) have petrographic characteristics and isotopic data corresponding to the Carrara marble, from the Apuan Alps (Table 3); one of the samples (Rep. 2) comes from a small fragment of thin slab, the second one comes from other possible slab of thicker section or from a fragment of block;

the 59 samples of marble blocks from the shipwreck of Capo Granitola were almost all identified as Proconnesian marble, including one dubious sample (n. 55) that showed minero-petrographic features of Carrara/Göktepe marbles, but that, once analysed chemically, gave high magnesium (common for Proconnesian marble, and unusual for Carrara) and low strontium contents (typical for Proconnesian and Carrara marbles, uncommon for Göktepe) (Table 4, Fig. 12).

Samples GZrep1 and GZrep2, belonging to the “pebbles” found among the blocks, have been identified with the Pentelic.

SECTION

Discussion of the results

PARAGRAPH

The different values of δ13C obtained from Proconnesian marble samples may suggest a source of blocks from different ‘loci’ (quarrying areas) of the northern territory of the Marmara island.

PARAGRAPH

The presence of blocks with fine grained fabric poses the question about their provenience: particular fine grained areas of Proconnesian marble (very frequent in this marbles) or other fine-grained marbles such as Carrara or Göktepe.

The qualitative chemical analysis of one of the dubious marbles (n. 55) has been useful to discriminate among these three types of marble: the low amount of Sr is comparable with Proconnesian as well as with Carrara, but not with Göktepe (Table 5) that usually shows values well above 500 ppm.

Since the fabric of the sample is not in agreement with that of Carrara marble, it may be concluded that the marble is a fine-grained Proconnesian one: both marbles were largely exploited in Roman imperial times.

PARAGRAPH

In addition, two small samples of artefacts contained in the cargo, GZrep1 and GZrep2 (Table 4), were also analysed: they both are probably Pentelic marble, also very commonly used throughout the Mediterranean in the provinces of the Roman Empire.

This two samples can be interpreted either as residues of previous cargos or as ballast.

PARAGRAPH

Rather interesting is the identification of marbles other than Proconnesian inside the cargos, such as the Pentelic in the shipwreck of Marzamemi, and the marble of Carrara in the wrecks of Isola delle Correnti.

These findings confirm the importance of investigating archeometrically all the marbles of cargos (particularly those of white color), in order to avoid major errors of identification and determination of the origin of the marbles.

If there had not been a full sampling of the wrecked marbles, incomplete conclusions would have been drawn.

Carrara and Pentelic marble blocks are, indeed, macroscopically similar to the fine-grained Proconnesian and thus easily mismatched, especially in submarine environment.

PARAGRAPH

The same approach already applied by the Venetian research team on the cargo of Punta Scifo D allowed to identify, among the numerous blocks of Proconnesian, few items of other white marble (Beltrame et al., 2014).

PARAGRAPH

In the end of 1st century CE, the Proconnesian marble, quarried in the isle of Marmara, begun to replace the marble of Luni for the construction of buildings (Pensabene, 2013, 320).

In the Severan period, the quantity of marble available at Marmara and the ease of loading it allowed the acceleration of the programme of renovation of Roman cities, facilitated also by its cost, which, according to the Edict of Diocletian of the 301 CE, was the cheapest of the white Mediterranean marbles (Pensabene, 2002, 50).

A great deal of Proconnesian marble arrived at Rome (Pensabene, 2013, 320–321), where it was used for the largest public buildings such as the Arch of Septimius Severus.

SECTION

Conclusion

PARAGRAPH

The three cargos of Roman age, analysed in Sicily, are almost coherent transportations of Proconnesian marble.

The ship of Marzamemi carried also one block of Pentelic while the ship of Isola delle Correnti carried a very thin slab and either a thick slab or a fragment of block of lunense marble from Carrara.

The ship of Capo Granitola carried only Proconnesian marble although pebbles of lunense, which could be residual of previous transportations, have been also identified.

PARAGRAPH

The results of our analysis, along with the finding of many other shipwrecks transporting the same marble, confirm that Proconnesian was one of the most (if not the most) popular and marketed marble between the 2nd and 3rd century CE, probably also because its cheap cost (Pensabene, 1994, 291; Russell, 2013).2

The blocks transported in the ships sunk at Marzamemi, Isola delle Correnti and Capo Granitola (as well as at Punta Scifo) document a trade, in the 3rd century CE, when this commerce was at its peak, in large semi-finished blocks of Proconnesian marble (although we have to consider the exception of the three moulded bases from Granitola), while the identification of an item of Pentelic marble at Marzamemi, and of two “slabs” of lunense at Isola delle Correnti, could be evidence of small secondary cargos.

PARAGRAPH

While the Punta Scifo D shipwreck, with its location, is clear evidence of the well-known route of marble from Marmara to Rome, or to the West in general, which remained along the coasts of Puglia and Calabria and probably was directed to Rome the position of the Sicilian shipwrecks (also considering the presence of lunense in one of the sites) could suggest different routes for these cargoes which will be the object of a supplementary study.
