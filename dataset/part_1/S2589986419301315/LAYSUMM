TITLE

Focal seizures associated with the chapeau de gendarme sign or ictal pouting of insular origin

PARAGRAPH

We report a teenager with childhood onset ‘chapeau de gendarme’ or ‘ictal pouting’ seizures.

Chapeau de gendarme ictal sign has been associated with frontal lobe epilepsy, however in this case, after pre-surgical evaluation, we confirmed anterior insular lobe origin.

Surgical resection of the insular and frontal-lobe network resulted in seizure freedom.

We propose that the anterior insular cortex should be included during invasive investigations of chapeau de gendarme or ictal pouting seizures.
