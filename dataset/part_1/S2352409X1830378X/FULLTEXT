TITLE

Multifocal bone lesions in an ancient Egyptian child mummy

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

The value of historic human remains for the study of the evolution of human morphology and disease patterns is widely recognized (Bosch, 2000).

Preserved tissues are the most direct source, in comparison to secondary sources such as visual or written records.

PARAGRAPH

Ancient mummies are an especially rich source for the study of disease in former times.

They originate from different cultures and time periods, and in comparison to skeletal remains, mummies are composed of preserved soft tissue (Cockburn and Cockburn, 1980).

This allows for the study of a wide spectrum of diseases, including those of infectious, vascular or neoplastic etiologies (Aufderheide, 2003; Lynnerup, 2007).

Hereby novel disease concepts, such as the evidence of arteriosclerosis in Peruvian and Egyptian mummies, as recently demonstrated, might change our understanding of modern civilization disease (Thompson et al., 2013).

PARAGRAPH

In order to investigate such valuable historic remains, non-invasive diagnostic tools are required.

For skeletal, and especially mummified remains radiological analyses are the methods of choice with conventional X-ray and computed tomography (CT) as currently the gold standard.

In the case presented herein, a CT was performed to estimate age and sex, as well as to record intra vitam pathologies and post mortem changes.

PARAGRAPH

An ancient Egyptian child mummy from the Musée d'art et d'histoire in Geneva, Switzerland, Accession-no: D 404 (Ritschard, 2003), was radiologically investigated (Fig. 1a).

The original provenance of the mummy is unknown.

It was donated to the museum by Walther Fol (collector and patron; 1832–1890) and arrived at the museum in 1865.

The mummy is embalmed and bandaged and wears a mask.

The height is 94 cm.

According to the hieroglyphs on the shroud the child mummy dates from the Roman period (30 BCE–390 CE).

However no C-14 analyses have been performed.

SECTION

Material and methods

PARAGRAPH

The child mummy has previously been investigated by X-ray and CT in 1983 (Hauser and Ody, 1983).

In order of significant technical improvements the CT-scan has now been repeated.

For radiological analyses a CT scan was performed at the Geneva University Hospital (HUG), Switzerland on a clinical CT-scanner (Biograph 64, Siemens, Erlangen).

Several acquisitions have been done with variable imaging parameters; 0,6 respectively 1 mm slice thickness, 80 respectively 120 kV tube voltage, 198–475 mA X-ray Tube Current and 0,625 × 0.625-mm detector configuration.

For post-processing including multi-planar reconstructions (MPR) and three-dimensional volume rendering (3D VR) reconstructions OsiriX–MD 64 bit (version 8.0.1; Pixmeo, Switzerland) software as well as Sectra PACS (Sectra AB, Sweden) tools were used.

Age estimation included dental status and the bone status of the hand, according to Greulich and Pyle (Greulich and Pyle, 1959).

In order to increase the accuracy, the bone age of the elbow, knee and ankle have also been included (Brodeur et al., 1981; Hoerr et al., 1962; Pyle and Hoerr, 1955).

In the present case the standard conventional radiographs for age estimation are not present, so the CT scans have been used instead, considering the beginning of carpal bone ossification seen on CT and the shape of the carpal bones as rough approximation.

Sex estimation was based on possible remnants of genital organs.

Radiological report

SECTION

General

PARAGRAPH

The skeleton is intact and the mummy is bandaged and wears a face mask.

Bangles are worn on both wrists, leading to artefact building (Fig. 1b & c).

SECTION

Cranium

PARAGRAPH

The lamina cribrosa and the cellulae ethmoidales are damaged mainly on the left side, and the lamina papyracea of the left orbit shows a ca 10 mm defect; indicating a transnasal excerebration (Fig. 2a).

The cranial cavity is empty apart from a small dense structure located in the right occipital region, probably a bone fragment, originating from the fractured ethmoid bone.

A small round defect is seen in the temporal bone on the left side; it has well defined margins and has approximately a 10 mm radius.

The lesion is wider on the inner side of the skull.

A small bone fragment is seen in the same area.

The overlying skin is intact.

Another similar roundish defect of 5 mm radius is found in the left frontal bone, however in this area the overlying skin is missing (Fig. 2b–d).

PARAGRAPH

The clivus and the frontonasal suture are not fully ossified yet.

The nasal bone is fractured.

The frontal sinus has not developed.

However, the maxillary sinus, sphenoidal sinus and mastoid are all well pneumatised.

The sphenoidal sinus shows a small lesion anteriorly.

While the right orbit is preserved, the left orbit shows a small lesion in the lamina papyraecea.

Remnants of the extraocular muscles, sclera and optic nerves are visible in both orbits.

There are no other areas of interest in the cranial vault.

SECTION

Dental status

PARAGRAPH

The dentition is normally shaped, caries-free and is comprised of a complete deciduous dentition (Fig. 3), and gives an age estimation of 4.5 years (e.g. the first permanent premolar has a complete outline of the cusps, the first permanent molar an initial root formation) (AlQahtani et al., 2010).

SECTION

Vertebral column and pelvis

PARAGRAPH

The vertebral column is deformed probably due to the mummification process: the head is in extreme flexion and the dens axis is cranially dislocated towards the foramen magnum.

This has resulted in missing lordosis/kyphosis in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine.

Right convex skoliotic deformity is present.

This leads to pelvic obliquity (right lower than left), resulting in a lower position of the right foot.

PARAGRAPH

At thoracic level 8/9 there appears to be a frontal discus lesion and a slight dehiscence of the vertebra 8/9.

In the sacral bone several dense structures are observed, which are likely to be penetrated embalming resin.

Remnants of the dura and spinal nerves are present in the spinal canal.

In the cervical part some bone fragments are identifiable, probably originating from the cranial lesions.

PARAGRAPH

Multifocal sclerotic lesions affect the vertebral column and the left femoral head and neck (Figs. 4 & 5).

PARAGRAPH

The lesions vary in size and are found in multiple adjacent vertebrae along the entire spine, with most notable lesions starting from C7 downwards, including part of the lumbar spine and the sacrum.

The lesions have a round to oval shape with well-defined margins, are located in the frontal part of the vertebra and the size varies from ca. 2 mm to max 10 mm radius.

Some of the vertebrae show slight irregularity of the endplates, however the vertebral body as well as the anterior and posterior alignment remains intact.

PARAGRAPH

The left femoral head is slightly deformed and shows hyperdense sclerotic lesions, as described above.

Also the femoral neck shows these lesions, however the physeal plate is still open (Fig. 5).

The right hip does not show any lesions.

SECTION

Thorax

PARAGRAPH

The shoulder joints are both subluxated to the posterior.

The whole posterior part of the thoracic cavity shows an isodense structure, most likely corresponding to thickened embalming substances (Fig. 4c).

In the mediastinum tissue remnants, including a possible remnant of the heart are visible (Fig. 4c).

In addition, diaphragmatic rests are visible on both sides.

Remnants of what are possibly trachea and the oesophagus are also seen.

The sternal bone has a broad dehiscence between the manubrium and the corpus.

Several rib fractures are present, (notably the 5th and 6th rib laterally on the left side).

SECTION

Abdomen

PARAGRAPH

On the left flank there is a cut in the skin, indicating trans-abdominal organ removal.

Several dense structures are seen in the abdominal cavity as well as in the pelvis area which are likely to be organ – or bandage packages.

(Figs. 4b & 6a).

No remnants of liver, kidneys, spleen or pancreas are identifiable.

SECTION

Lower extremities

PARAGRAPH

Both ankle joints are in a flexed position, and the metatarso-phalangeal joints are hyperextended and at certain parts luxated (MT V right).

MT I and the proximal phalanx I show some irregular bone lesions of unknown etiology.

SECTION

Upper extremities

PARAGRAPH

No pathologies are seen.

SECTION

Age and sex estimation

SECTION

Sex estimation

PARAGRAPH

Possible remnants of the external male genitals can be identified.

No inner genital organs are preserved.

SECTION

Age estimation

PARAGRAPH

According to Greulich and Pyle related CT interpretation (De Donno et al., 2013) the bone age of the hand corresponds to plate 13 or 14, indicating an age of 4.6–5 years (male standard).

The first 4 carpal bones present show an already advanced shape (capitatum, hamatum, triquetrum, lunatum) as indicated in Fig. 6b.

PARAGRAPH

The radial head and the olecranon are not ossified yet.

According to Bodeur et al (Brodeur et al., 1981) the bone atlas of the elbow indicates an age of 4–4.5 years (Fig. 6c & d).

The bone age of the knee corresponds to plate 13 or 14, corresponding to an age of 4–4.5 years (male).

The bone age of the foot and ankle indicates an age of 4.2–4.9 years corresponding to Plate 14 or 15.

The dental status estimates an age of 4.5 years.

In conclusion the child was most likely to be 4–5 years old at time of death.

SECTION

Discussion

SECTION

Age and sex estimation

PARAGRAPH

In skeletal remains the sex is usually assessed by the shape of the pelvis (Bruzek, 2002).

Additional features such as the cranium might help to confirm, but should not be used alone.

In juvenile specimens however the form of the pelvis is not fully developed and reliable sex discrimination is not guaranteed (Scheuer and Black, 2004).

In mummified remains soft tissue is widely preserved and sexual organs might be still visible.

Due to possible remnants of the external genitals the mummy in this study is most likely of masculine sex.

PARAGRAPH

Age estimation in living individuals includes physical investigation as well as the hand bone age and the dental status (Schmeling et al., 2008).

Nowadays age estimation by using X-ray of the hand according to Greulich and Pyle (Greulich and Pyle, 1959) is widely accepted.

PARAGRAPH

In mummies, however, age identification is rather difficult, since the tissue is shrunken and the joints are often malpositioned.

Furthermore age estimation in historic remains and of people of different ethnicity might differ from the standard methods.

However the used approach is the current standard in palaeoradiology.

In conclusion an age at death of 4–5 years seems reasonable.

SECTION

Individual age-related alterations

PARAGRAPH

The clivus and the frontonasal suture are not fully ossified, which is physiologically normal for a child.

The synchondrosis sphenooccipitalis ossifies first in the youth at 13-16 years (Hofmann and Prescher, 2012; Melson, 1972; Scott, 1958).

The missing frontal sinus is probably also an age-corresponding fact, since the frontal sinus can start developing as early as two years, but pneumatization often starts later, around the age of 5 (Adibelli et al., 2011; Dixon et al., 1997).

SECTION

Peri-/postmortem alterations

PARAGRAPH

Diverse peri- and postmortem alterations can usually be observed in mummies (Hoffman et al., 2002; Micozzi, 1991; Milroy, 1999; Rühli and Böni, 2000).

Multiple changes occur due to dehydration and mummification and mainly affect soft tissue and internal organs (Aufderheide, 2011).

PARAGRAPH

Other postmortem changes are presumably caused by the use of force during mummification; especially when removing the brain and intestines – leading to e.g. small bone lesions, broken teeth or damage to soft tissue.

Further lesions probably occurred during the discovery and transport to other countries.

PARAGRAPH

Several postmortem changes are observed in the child mummy: the damages in the facial bone indicate a transnasal excerebration and the cut in the left flank results from the organ removement.

The lesions in the cranial plate and the fractured nasal bone are most likely postmortem changes.

The luxated shoulder joints, the deformed vertebral column, including the alterations at thoracic vertebra 8/9, as well as the sternal bone dehiscence and the rib fractures are probably caused by the mummification process or during discovery and/or transportation.

PARAGRAPH

Few possible organ remnants are identifiable.

The dense structures located in the right abdominal cavity and pelvis are most likely organ packages or remnants of intestines.

This is supported by the fact, that bandage packages are traditionally present dominantly on the left side, being used as stuffing material.

No other abdominal organs can be identified.

Generally pancreas, spleen and kidneys are rarely found in mummified remains, since they undergo rapid autolysis after death (Aufderheide, 2003; Hostiuc et al., 2017; O'Neill et al., 2016; Tomita et al., 2004).

SECTION

Pathologies

PARAGRAPH

The radiological analyses showed multiple sclerotic lesions in the vertebral column and a similar lesion affecting the left femoral head, probably leading to the deformation of the femoral head.

Most likely they are signs of a systemic process, since the distribution pattern seems typical for a hematogenous spread.

Various differential diagnoses seem possible, however most likely is an infectious origin, such as tuberculosis or alternatively brucellosis, fungal or parasitic infection.

Infectious involvement of the spine is most often secondary to hematogenous spread via the venous plexus, or alternatively with arterial placement of an infected micro-embolus in the vertebra, leading to infarction and secondary infection (Acharya and Gibbs, 2016).

Among the infectious diseases, tuberculosis commonly affects the spine.

Hereby the thoracic and lumbar spine are more frequently affected than the cervical spine.

Spinal tuberculosis is essentially a disease of childhood, with almost half those involved being under the age of 10 years (Murray and Jacobson, 1971).

Brucellosis can present as granulomatous osteomyelitis of the spine; however it seems less likely since it more often occurs in older patients and predominantly affects the lumbar spine (Garg and Somvanshi, 2011).

Even though fungal infection shows a similar disease pattern as in the presented case, it is a very rare disease, predominantely of the adult (Cobar et al., 2016).

PARAGRAPH

Sarcoidosis can seldom present with spinal involvement including multifocal vertebral lesions; however it seems rather unlikely, since it rarely affects children and there is no evidence that sarcoidosis was widespread in ancient Egypt.

PARAGRAPH

Other possible differential diagnoses include bone infarctions due to septic spread (e.g. endocarditis) or haemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease.

Also chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a potential differential diagnoses, since it can affect any bone, including the vertebral column and present with diverse patterns (Schilling et al., 2002).

A neoplastic origin is rather unlikely.

Especially metastases seem implausible, as the sclerotic margins suggest a benign process.

Since the inner organs are shrunken or missing, they cannot contribute to the diagnosis.

PARAGRAPH

Alternatively the lesions are not connected to each other and the process in the femoral head might originate from necrosis (e.g. Perthes disease).

PARAGRAPH

An infectious etiology of the lesions seems likely regarding the time period.

Evidence for the presence of tuberculosis in ancient Egypt has been reported from different regions and time periods (Bianucci et al., 2008; Crubézy et al., 1998; Nerlich et al., 1997; Nerlich et al., 2008; Zink et al., 2001).

The earliest documented case of tubercular spondylitis, written in Sanskrit, dates back to ca. 1500 BCE and several case reports of spinal tuberculosis are reported from ancient Egypt (Zink et al., 2007).

PARAGRAPH

Nowadays, tuberculosis is still widespread and one of the leading causes of adult deaths from an infectious disease.

Latent infections occur in about a quarter of the world's population and an estimated 10.4 million new (incident) TB cases/year are documented worldwide (WHO, 2016).

The causative agent is the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, most often M. tuberculosis.

Lung tuberculosis is responsible for about half of all tuberculosis infections, whereas osteoarticular tuberculosis accounts for 1–3% off all tuberculosis cases (Zychowicz, 2010).

The infection in musculoskeletal organs is typically secondary to another focus, located usually in the lungs or in the mediastinal lymph nodes, and is transmitted via hematogenous or lymphatic spread.

The infection is usually monoarticular, most often in the vertebrae and in the hip.

Other locations such as knee, ankle, elbow or wrist are rare.

Spinal tuberculosis is the most common form, also known as Pott's disease and was first reported by Percival Pott (1714–1788) in 1779.

The present case might be part of this disease with further spread to the left hip joint.

A primary focus in the lungs or the meninges can be speculated, however it can not be radiologically verified in the child mummy since the lung tissue and most part of the mediastinum as well as the brain have been removed.

A more advanced stage of the disease in another location could explain, that the vertebrae did not collapse yet and not build the classical Gibbus deformity.

PARAGRAPH

To further clarify, invasive investigations, including biopsies for histological and molecular analyses, might help.

However it will not be undertaken in the present case, since such precious historic remains should be left intact where possible.

PARAGRAPH

In what way these pathological changes contributed to the death of this child remains unknown.

However, if our hypothesis of the present systemic process due to an infection is correct, it might have led to death at this young age.

SECTION

Paleoradiology

PARAGRAPH

In paleoradiology, CT is currently the preferred imaging method for mummies.

Further imaging modalities such as MRI are evolving during recent years (Cavka et al., 2012; Rühli, 2015).

However it needs to be taken into account that the mummification and embalming processes alter the tissues, leading to difficulties in tissue identification and interpretation of pathological changes (Rühli et al., 2004).

Furthermore comparative data specifically for mummified tissue is lacking.

Diagnosis of disease in historic samples remains complex, especially since medical history and other investigations such as blood proofs are lacking and more invasive methods such as biopsies need to be avoided.

Thus multiple differential diagnoses need to be taken into consideration.
