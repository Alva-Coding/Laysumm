TITLE

Multifocal bone lesions in an ancient Egyptian child mummy

PARAGRAPH

An ancient Egyptian child mummy (Roman period, collection of Musée d’art et d’histoire, Geneva, Switzerland) has been investigated by Computed Tomography.

The aim of the radiological investigation was to estimate age and sex as well as to record intravitam pathologies and postmortem alterations.

Hereby the most interesting findings are multifocal bone lesions affecting the spine and the left hip.

Multiple diseases are discussed that could explain these lesions.

However, most likely seems an infectious etiology, and tuberculosis (TB) a possible diagnosis.

Also regarding the time period TB seems plausible, since the disease was wide spread in ancient Egypt.
