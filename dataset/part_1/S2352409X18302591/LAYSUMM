TITLE

Mid-late Holocene environmental and cultural dynamics at the south-west tip of Europe (Doñana National Park, SW Iberia, Spain)

PARAGRAPH

A multi-disciplinary research team presents the paleoenvironmental findings from a project that was carried out in the coastal marshland of southwest Spain.

A high-resolution, multi-proxy analysis—the first ever conducted in the area—allowed for a model that relates vegetation history and human impact with climate variability and the potential effects of extreme wave events (EWEs) on settlement patterns during the Copper and Bronze Ages.

Significant climate changes and four EWEs were identified for those cultural periods.

The magnitude of the second EWE, ~ 4200-4000 cal BP, was large enough to cause major landscape changes and usher in long-term depopulation.
