ABSTRACT

TITLE

Revisiting the date of the Java Sea Shipwreck from Indonesia

PARAGRAPH

In this article we draw on suites of new information to reinterpret the date of the Java Sea Shipwreck.

The ship was a Southeast Asian trading vessel carrying a large cargo of Chinese ceramics and iron as well as luxury items from outside of China, such as elephant tusks and resin.

Initially the wreck, which was recovered in Indonesia, was placed temporally in the mid- to late 13th century based on a single radiocarbon sample and ceramic styles.

We employ new data, including multiple radiocarbon dates and inscriptions found on some of the ceramics, to suggest that an earlier chronological placement be considered.
