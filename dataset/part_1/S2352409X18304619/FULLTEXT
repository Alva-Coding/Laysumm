TITLE

Variability in obsidian structural water content and its importance in the hydration dating of cultural artifacts

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Geological flows of rhyolitic glass, or obsidian, were routine sources of tool raw material for humans in the Lower and Middle Paleolithic (Adler et al., 2014; Merrick and Brown, 1984) and afterward (Shackley, 1998).

Easily accessible from primary surface outcroppings, or within secondarily deposited erosional contexts (Doleman et al., 2012), obsidian was knapped into functional tools, symbols of cultural interconnectedness (Torrence, 2011), or markers of social inequality (Pierce, 2015).

The abundance of obsidian in the archaeological record, created by its use within many types of cultural contexts, provides an opportunity for obsidian hydration age determinations to play a significant role in archaeological interpretation.

High resolution temporal reconstructions of past events benefit from chronometric assays where the standard errors associated with dates are small.

Rogers (2008b, 2010) discusses four major error sources that can impact the final age determination: hydration rim measurement precision, estimation of temperature history (effective hydration temperature), variation in the experimentally determined source-specific diffusion coefficient, and intra-source variability in intrinsic water content; all of which contribute to the final age uncertainty.

The fourth variable, the variability in obsidian structural water content, and its influence on the dating outcome, is the factor explored here.

PARAGRAPH

Once a geological nodule of obsidian is cleaved, molecular water is immediately adsorbed onto the new surface and begins to diffuse into the glass to form an optically visible hydration layer at high magnification (800×).

Over time the layer will increase in thickness if the glass surface is not dissolved by alkaline ground waters (Morgenstein et al., 1999) or subject to alteration through burning or abrasion (Steffen, 2005).

At any point in time the age of artifact manufacture may be estimated by measuring the amount of diffused water and converting that quantity to a calendar date with a compositionally dependent water diffusion coefficient adjusted for the temperature and humidity of the archaeological context (Rogers, 2007a, 2012; Stevenson et al., 1998).

PARAGRAPH

The development of ambient hydration rates is based upon extrapolations from diffusion coefficients experimentally determined at elevated temperatures (90–250 °C) on glasses of known geological provenance (Friedman and Long, 1976; Michels et al., 1983; Rogers and Duke, 2011; Rogers and Stevenson, 2017; Stevenson et al., 1998; Stevenson and Novak, 2011).

The application of the rate to archaeological specimens relies upon the assumption of compositional uniformity between the experimental source glass and the cultural artifact found away from the geological deposit.

Supportive evidence for this uniformity is based upon a similarity in trace element concentrations between the obsidian and its source as determined by commonly applied methods such as X-ray fluorescence (Shackley, 2005; Frahm, 2014; Fruend et al., 2015), ICP-MS (Tykot, 1998), or neutron activation analysis (Glascock, 2011; Perreault et al., 2016).

These data on the elemental composition are however are not sufficient in themselves and must be complemented by a knowledge of a source structural water content and its variability.

Only then can the laboratory diffusion coefficients be appropriately applied to equivalent materials.

PARAGRAPH

Accelerated hydration rate experiments on a variety of obsidians from around the globe have demonstrated that obsidian structural water in the form of bonded OH (hydroxyl) and/or total water (H2Ot) [H2Ot = OH + H2O] correlates strongly with experimental rates of diffusion to the extent that prediction equations for the Arrhenius rate constants have been developed (Stevenson et al., 1998; Rogers, 2015).

The influence of the anhydrous component on water diffusion has received only minor attention (Friedman and Long, 1976) and will require additional study to detail its role.

Consequently, our coverage of all the potential variables structuring the hydration rate will be incomplete, but we will focus on the impacts of structural water in the obsidian hydration dating (OHD) process.

PARAGRAPH

In this paper, it is our goal to illustrate the complexity of obsidian sources with respect to structural water content and how within-source variability can adversely skew the dating of cultural artifacts unless carefully evaluated.

To achieve this goal we have three objectives: 1) To provide a broad overview of a large number of prehistorically exploited obsidian geological sources to show the range of structural water content concentrations observed between sources with limited sampling (<33 specimens per source); 2) To examine in detail with a larger number of analyses, the intra-source variation in structural water content for two different geological locations that contain obsidians with high and low structural water concentrations; and 3) To demonstrate through calculation the potential errors in hydration dating that can be introduced by assuming an intra-source average for structural water content.

Current OHD methods in applied archaeological contexts generally employ hydration rates for a source, and account for intra-source water variation by increasing the standard deviation (Rogers, 2010).

Diffusion of water in rhyolitic obsidian

PARAGRAPH

The investigation of volcanic magmatic processes has generated an informative literature on the diffusion of water in natural glasses near and above the glass transition temperature (>600 °C) (e.g., Zhang et al., 1991; Zhang, 1999).

It has been proposed that during water diffusion within the bulk glass that molecular water (H2Om) moves through the glass in a series of jumps into “doorways” or small interstitial sites (Doremus, 2002).

The rate at which this process occurs depends upon the intermolecular distance of the host material matrix compared to the size of the diffusing species (Liritzis, 2006).

There is also a conversion between H2Om and OH which occurs at these higher temperatures, but this reaction is temperature dependent, and greatly reduced below 400 °C (Nowak and Behrens, 1995) and inferred not to be detectable in obsidian hydrated at ambient temperature (Anovitz et al., 2008).

PARAGRAPH

It is proposed that a different mechanism exists for ambient surface water diffusion in obsidian because the diffusion coefficients developed at >400 °C do not accurately extrapolate to coefficients developed on naturally weathered samples (Anovitz et al., 2008; Zhang and Xu, 2003; Yokoyama et al., 2008).

At low (archaeological) temperatures infrared spectroscopic studies suggest that ambient (environmental) molecular water (H2Ome) is the mobile species that enters the glass surface and that OH concentration within the glass matrix remains unchanged (Anovitz et al., 2008; Yokoyama et al., 2008).

PARAGRAPH

Variation in the hydration rate at low temperature is impacted by glass constituents that influence the nano-pore structure of the obsidian.

Rhyolitic glasses consist of high amounts of silica and alumina and lesser amounts of calcium, sodium, potassium, iron, manganese, and magnesium and slight variations in these constituents may impact the size of the “doorways”.

In addition, the presence of micro-crystals have been identified as a variable that may slow the water diffusion process (Laskaris et al., 2017; Liritzis et al., 2007) although this factor has not been quantified.

Structural water is also present within unhydrated bulk obsidian as both molecular water (H2Om) and as hydroxyl (OH) (Stolper, 1982; Newman et al., 1986; Silver and Stolper, 1989).

The sum of both species is referred to as the total water concentration (H2Ot).

It is the combined concentration of these two water species that is thought to be highly influential on the size of the glass pore structure and the diffusion rate for molecular environmental water (H2Ome).

SECTION

Analytical methods

PARAGRAPH

The realization of our research goals requires that we have high precision estimates of the total structural water (H2Ot) within our individual geological samples.

The measurement of water species in rhyolites is easily accomplished by infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTIR) on parallel sided coupons cut from hand samples (Stolper, 1982; von Aulock et al., 2014) coupled with calibrations that relate infrared absorbance to concentration (Newman et al., 1986; Zhang et al., 1997).

Applications of these sample preparation procedures and calibrations to archaeological artifacts are problematic in many cases because of small artifact size, restrictions on destructive analysis by museum conservators and government agencies, or the desire to process a very large number of samples.

Therefore, we have revised the calibration for total structural water estimation based upon obsidian specific gravity (density), as originally developed by Ambrose and Stevenson (2004), and use it to assess variation in this important hydration dating parameter in a manner that is non-destructive to the artifact.

PARAGRAPH

The revised H2Ot (OH + H2Om) vs. density calibration was developed using 35 samples from 15 geological deposits of obsidian (Table 1).

These samples exhibited an inter-source range of H2Ot between 0.07 and 1.66 wt%.

The concentration of the contributing hydroxyl (OH) and molecular water (H2Om) species for each sample was determined by transmission FTIR.

Geological hand samples were sectioned on a Buehler slow speed circular saw to generate ~1.0 mm parallel sided coupons approximately 1.5 × 1.5 cm in dimension.

The coupons were then polished on a vertically faced lapidary wheel with a series of polishing papers to an 8 μm finish and the final thickness in millimeters was measured with a Mitutuyo digital micrometer (Table 1).

The precision of the micrometer is reported by the manufacturer to be ±1.27 μm.

PARAGRAPH

Infrared absorbance measurements were made on a Thermo Nicolet Avatar 360 FTIR spectrometer.

The band at 4500 cm−1 was monitored for the concentration of OH and the band at 5200 cm−1 for H2Om.

The infrared peak heights represent 64 averaged scans run in air at 0.2 cm/s.

A background spectrum under the same parameters was collected immediately before each analysis.

Peak heights were determined using Omnic software using a linear baseline.

Peak heights were converted to weight percent concentration with the Beer-Lambert equation:%H2OmorOH=18.02∗abs/t∗d∗ewhere: 18.02 is the molecular weight of water, abs = infrared absorbance (peak height) at either 4500 cm−1 or 5200 cm−1, t = thickness in millimeters, d = density in g/cm3, and e is the appropriate extinction coefficient for OH (1.73 ± 0.02 l/mol) or H2Om (1.61 ± 0.05 l/mol) developed by Newman et al. (1986).

The resulting weight percent values for OH and H2Om are summed to produce the total structural water content (H2Ot) (Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

The density for each obsidian coupon of known structural water content was determined by the Archimedes method, or immersion method, using a heavy liquid.

Density values were computed using the equation:Densityg/cm3=massgof coupon inair∗density of liquidg/cm3massgof coupon inair−mass (g) of coupon in liquid

PARAGRAPH

The commercially available Unigrav 1.6 (tetrachloroethylene) served as the immersion liquid.

Of critical importance to the estimation process is the density of the liquid as a function of temperature.

During the density determination process the temperature of the liquid will increase as coupons of slightly higher temperature are repeatedly placed into the beaker containing the liquid.

The impact of this is an increase in fluid volume which results in a lower density of the immersion liquid from its reported value.

PARAGRAPH

To compensate for this dynamic, we developed a calibration that quantified the relationship between the density of the immersion liquid and temperature (Fig. 1).

Two pre-weighed volumetric flasks (100 ml and 50 ml) were filled with Unigrav 1.6 and placed within a 2 l thermoelectrically controlled water bath.

The flasks were placed within ceramic crucibles to buffer the impact of the heating element underneath the bath.

The temperature of the water bath was reduced to 0.4 °C using crushed ice and the water temperature was monitored with a Vernier temperature probe with a precision of (±0.1 °C).

The water bath was also stirred to reduce thermal gradients.

As the temperature of the bath gradually warmed the expanding heavy liquid was removed with a pipet to the fill line and the flask was removed from the bath, dried, and weighed to two decimal places on an electronic scale.

This was repeated until the immersion liquid reached a temperature of 35 °C.

A simple linear regression line (Fig. 1) was fit to the paired data values (Table 2) that resulted in the calibration:Density of Unigrav1.6g/cm3=−0.0016∗Temperature°C+1.608

PARAGRAPH

The density of geological obsidian samples was determined on a glass shielded Ohaus Adventurer Pro analytical balance with a precision of ±0.0001 g using the manufacturer supplied density kit.

A Vernier thermal probe and data logger was again used to monitor the temperature of the immersion liquid.

Three trials of 10 repeat measurements on different coupons from the Obsidian Cliff obsidian source, Wyoming, (Table 3) indicated the precision of density determinations ranged between 0.0009 and 0.0016 g/cm3.

Structural water calibration and an analysis of accuracy

PARAGRAPH

The information in Table 1 provides the raw data for developing a calibration relating obsidian density to intrinsic water content (%H2Ot).

In Table 4, infrared results are paired with their obsidian source densities, as determined by the gravimetric technique, on the same polished geological slab samples.

A bivariate plot of these data (Fig. 2) reveals a sigmoid shaped trend line.

The near horizontal part of the trend line represents H2Ot concentration of 0.07% to 0.20% for obsidian densities between 2.34 and 2.53 g/cm3.

The steeply sloping trend line covering the region between 2.34 and 2.30 g/cm3 represents the occurrence of H2Ot between 0.21% and 1.66%.

The unique configuration of this calibration curve is accounted for by the differentially occurring contributions of OH and H2Om.

In Fig. 3, the concentrations of OH and H2Om (Table 1) are presented in a bivariate plot against H2Ot on the X-axis.

At low concentrations of H2Ot the dominant form of structural water is OH and H2Om is not detectable.

As H2Ot increases above 0.2% the contribution of OH declines and approaches a zero slope while an increase H2Om accounts for the upward curve in the lower trend line.

Previous investigations on the proportional contributions of OH and H2Om demonstrate the lines eventually cross and OH makes no further contribution at higher H2Ot concentrations while H2O continues to increase linearly up to an 8% water concentration in high water glasses synthesized at elevated temperature and pressure (Silver et al., 1990:150).

PARAGRAPH

The calibration data follow a sigmoid form (Fig. 2), so the best-fit line is a four-parameter form known as a dose-response equation (PSI, 2010:247ff.).

We selected this model since two trends are represented in our data; the gradual increase and leveling off of OH in low water obsidians (the “dose”) and the exponential addition of molecular water (the “response”).

The four parameters describing the equation are the top asymptotic value (“Top”), the bottom asymptotic value (“Bottom”), the 50% point (“EC50”), and the slope (“Hillslope”).

The equation is of the form:w=Bottom+Top−Bottom/1+expHillslope∗d−EC50where: w is %H2Ot and d is density.

To account for the very shallow slope at higher densities, a decreasing exponential best fit was made in this region.

The exponential was then subtracted from the data set, and four-parameter logistic fit was computed between density and H2Ot.

The sigmoid best fit was computed using PSIPlot®, yielding the parameters in Table 5.

The complete form of the best fit is thus:wt%H2Ot=0.013312+1.561593−0.013312/1+exp236.63∗d−2.323609+1.7896∗exp−1.2486∗d

PARAGRAPH

The mean error of the fit is ±0.0003, and the standard deviation is ±0.189.

The small value of mean error indicates the bias is negligible, although the standard deviations are significant.

Further investigation of best-fit sigmoids, especially five-parameter fits for asymmetric sigmoids, showed that they increased computational complexity but did not improve quality, so the four-parameter fit was retained.

The best fit line discussed here has been derived from a data set with calibrated densities in the range 2.3049 ≤ d ≤ 2.5251 g/cm3.

Outside this range the calibration curve should be applied only with great caution, particularly for calibrated densities <2.3049 g/cm3 where the trend is not clear.

PARAGRAPH

Fig. 2 shows the visual fit.

The individual specimens are highly correlated with the model trend line except for a small cluster of specimens in the density range of 2.3450 g/cm3.

These specimens are of a slightly lower density than the best-fit line and as a result the water content values are slightly over estimated by approximately 0.05 wt%.

This dispersion is also present in the data presented by Ambrose and Stevenson (2004).

Fig. 2 also reveals there to be three outliers (open triangle symbols) in the calibration data set (Table 6).

An analysis of differences between the data points and the best-fit curve shows all of them to be higher in density than expected.

The source of error for the outliers in both situations is not clear, but may arise because obsidian is a naturally-occurring material and lacks the homogeneity of manufactured glasses.

In particular, density variations could occur due to varying mineral inclusions.

It is unlikely that the outliers could be resolved by improved gravimetric techniques.

PARAGRAPH

Eq. (5) is the calibration curve relating obsidian density to intrinsic water content.

As such, it predicts a point value, corresponding to an error-free density data point.

In reality, however, the new data point will also contain experimental errors or uncertainty.

If the new density data point has an error of standard deviation σd, it will lead to an error standard deviation of σm in %H2Ot when computed from Eq. (5).

By the theory of propagation of errors (Taylor, 1982), the expected value of σm can be related to errors in density by:σm=∣∂w/∂d∣∗σdwith: w defined as in Eq. (5), the error standard deviation is then:σm=S/T−B∗ws−B2∗expS∗d−EC50∗σdor numerically:σm=139.9∗w−0.1492∗exp216.93∗d−2.3232∗σd

PARAGRAPH

Eq. (8) is valid as long as the uncertainty in density (σd) is small enough that the second derivative of Eq. (5) is negligible.

Examination of Fig. 2 shows that the horizontal axis spans a range of densities of only 0.2202 g/cm3 (from 2.3049 to 2.5251 g/cm3) and significant change occurs over ranges as small as 0.003 g/cm3.

Thus, Eq. (8) should be used with care.

A similar caution applies to Eq. (5).

If the standard deviation of the density measurement exceeds approximately 0.003 g/cm3, the value of w computed from the mean value of d may not be representative of the data set.

A method to avoid these limitations is to use a Monte Carlo simulation to model the calibration process, including the effects of experimental error, as discussed below.

SECTION

Global obsidian sources

PARAGRAPH

Gravimetric density determinations were made on 336 coupons cut from geological hand samples from 27 different obsidian sources obtained from the reference collection managed by the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) (Table 7).

The number of samples analyzed was highly variable, between 3 and 34, but most sources were represented by 9 to 25 samples.

The sample size depended on availability.

PARAGRAPH

Intrinsic water content of the specimens was computed using Eq. (5) above.

The total structural water content (H2Ot) for the sample set ranged from 0.11% to 0.76% with 21 sources between 0.11% and 0.27% H2Ot, and 6 sources between 0.32% and 0.76% H2Ot (Table 7).

While this variation is significant is does not capture the full range of structural water contents in natural obsidians which have been documented to range up to 2.6% (Newman et al., 1986).

PARAGRAPH

A bivariate plot (Fig. 4) of the total structural water (H2Ot) against the standard deviation of all measurements from each source reveals the presence of two trends.

The first trend is the lower line representing a gradual increase in the standard deviation as H2Ot increases to 0.76% while the second and upper trend line represents a much larger overall standard deviation and a greater variation in structural water as concentration increases.

A review of the raw data indicates that the three sources (Superior, AZ; Timber Butte, ID; Ucareo, Mexico) included in this upper trend line all contain distinct subgroups of samples with both low and high structural water concentrations.

SECTION

The Orito Obsidian Source, Rapa Nui, Chile

PARAGRAPH

The Polynesian island of Rapa Nui hosts four outcroppings of obsidian (Vezzolli and Acocella, 2009) all of which were exploited prehistorically at various levels of intensity.

Three of the sources (Rano Kau I, Rano Kau II, Orito) are located in the southwestern corner of the island while the offshore islet of Motu Iti is the fourth source.

Rano Kau II and Orito are the obsidians most encountered at inland domestic sites (Stevenson et al., 2013).

Hand samples of obsidian were obtained from the spatially limited sources of Rano Kau I, Rano Kau II, and Motu Iti.

The larger source of Orito consists of two surface outcrops on the eastern and western flanks of Maunga Orito which were exploited with open-pit mines (Stevenson et al., 1984).

These areas were systematically sampled using collection transects by Beardsley and Goles (2001) from which we obtained samples for this analysis.

PARAGRAPH

Intra-source structural water determinations by applying Eq. (5) were made on 133 samples from the four outcrops with the two Orito exposures sampled separately (Table 8).

The concentration of H2Ot is low for all four sources.

Orito (east), Orito (west), and Motu Iti all have mean H2Ot values of 0.10% with a standard deviation ±0.001%.

The Rano Kau I and Rano Kau II sources have a mean H2Ot concentration of 0.10% and their standard deviations are slightly greater (0.002–0.003%).

The Rapa Nui sources can be considered as very “dry” with all of the water in the form of OH.

SECTION

The Red Hill Source, New Mexico, USA

PARAGRAPH

In contrast to the Rapa Nui example, the Red Hill obsidian deposit is considered a terrain source that occurs in Catron County, New Mexico (Findlow and Bolognese, 1982).

Spatially extensive and covering many square miles, the small obsidian nodules are 1–8 cm in diameter and occur in Middle Tertiary ash fall deposits (Shackley, 2005).

Twelve samples of unknown provenience were accessed from the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) collection and 29 samples from surface collections by Jeffrey Ferguson (WTP 150/194), for a total of 41 samples.

Intra-source structural water determination values calculated from Eq. (5) range from 0.17% to 1.38% with a 1-sigma standard deviation up to 0.62% (Table 9).

As such, the %H2Ot in the Red Hill source consists of both OH and H2Om and the concentrations are highly variable.

Impacts to archaeological hydration rates

PARAGRAPH

In many cases the range in obsidian density values for an archaeological source exceeds the precision value for an individual specimen.

As a result, a specific obsidian source will exhibit a range of hydration rates in proportion to its chemical variability and the magnitude of this range can be demonstrated through computation.

The form of the hydration rate prediction equation is independent of the hydration layer measurement method (optical versus mass gain) but the coefficients will differ because of the distinct units of measurement.

Thus, we present both alternatives that may be implemented by researchers today in the obsidian dating process.

SECTION

Obsidian hydration rates for optical measurements

PARAGRAPH

Obsidian hydration dating as performed by optical microscopy is based on measuring the thickness of the stress zone in micrometers created by water diffusion into the obsidian.

The experimental evidence indicates that surface water diffusion is a complex phase-specific dynamic (Liritzis, 2014).

After the initial surface conditions are established, the leading edge of this stress zone, or hydration front, progresses into the obsidian proportional to tn, where n is approximately 0.5 within the limits of experimental error (Stevenson and Scheetz, 1989; Stevenson et al., 1998; Rogers and Duke, 2011).

The agreement with classical diffusion theory, in particular Fick's formulations and the Boltzmann transformation (Crank, 1975:105ff.

; Rogers, 2007a, 2012), may be a coincidence or may be due to an as-yet-undiscovered property of the diffusion process itself.

PARAGRAPH

This prediction of hydration rates employs the equation of Rogers (2015), which is based on a square-root-of-time model:k=exp37.76−2.289∗w−10,433/TK+1023∗w/TKwhere: k is hydration rate in μ2/1000 years, TK is effective hydration temperature in Kelvin (K), and w is %H2Ot in wt%.

This equation is of the same form as equations developed by Zhang et al. (1991) and Zhang and Behrens (2000), although the numerical constants differ because of differing temperature and pressure regimes.

PARAGRAPH

By the same logic as Eq. (6), propagation of error theory gives a standard deviation of the rate due to errors in:σk=−2.289+1023∗w/TK∗k∗σm

PARAGRAPH

Eq. (9) can be put in the form of the familiar Arrhenius equation:k=A∗exp(−E/R∗TKwhere: k is hydration rate in μ2/1000 years, A is the pre-exponential factor in the same units, E is the activation energy in J/mol°K, R is the universal gas constant in J/mol, and TK is the temperature in K.

The Arrhenius constants are then:A=exp37.76−2.289∗wandE/R=10,433−1023∗w

Obsidian hydration rates for water mass uptake

PARAGRAPH

Measurement of the mass of water absorbed, or lost by an obsidian sample, per unit obsidian mass, is the most physically fundamental method of measuring hydration, and has a long history.

Methods employed for such measurements have been mass loss on heating (e.g., Ebert et al., 1991), infrared transmission spectrometry (e.g., Newman et al., 1986), and infrared photoacoustic spectrometry (e.g., Stevenson et al., 2013; Stevenson and Novak, 2011).

PARAGRAPH

It has been shown that the process of mass uptake is a function of temperature, pressure, and openness of the glass matrix as measured by intrinsic water concentration.

Stevenson and Novak (2011) demonstrated that mass gain proceeds proportional to tn where t is time and n is an exponent lying between approximately 0.4 and 0.7 and that water mass increase is described by:Cwt=ktn

PARAGRAPH

Most applications adhere to the use of tn where n = 0.5 and their data then yield an expression for hydration rate:k=exp24.80−5.196∗w−10,433/TK+2857∗w/TKwhere: k is in (wt% H2Ot)2/1000 yrs, TK is temperature in °K, and w is %H2Ot in wt% (Stevenson and Novak, 2011; Rogers, 2015).

For this case the pre-exponential A isA=exp24.80−5.196∗wand the activation energy is:E/R=10,433−2857∗w

PARAGRAPH

Appendix A briefly summarizes the analysis of the Stevenson and Novak (2011) data leading to this model.

Assessment of error: the computation method

PARAGRAPH

The density-H2Ot calibration curve (Eq. (5)), the optical hydration rate calibration curve (Eq. (9)), and the water mass uptake calibration curve (Eq. (15)) are all point solutions.

They are the result of a best-fit process, in which the assumption is made implicitly that the independent variable is error-free.

In actuality the independent variable is never error-free, and the presence of errors can significantly distort the outcome.

To address this issue a Monte Carlo simulation was constructed to model the computation process for both intrinsic water (w) and hydration rate (k).

Input variables were the mean and standard deviation of the density measurements.

The simulation carries out multiple computations of %H2Ot and hydration rates, including random errors in density.

The effects of density error are created by a random number generator, and scaled by the input density error standard deviation.

A total of N = 10,000 iterations were made for each data point, after which the mean and standard deviations were computed for both intrinsic water and hydration rate.

PARAGRAPH

The process simulation was applied to our data set of 27 global sources.

Table 10 and Fig. 5 present the results for %H2Ot and density.

This variation is also expressed in the hydration rates which were also computed by process simulation, and are presented in Table 10 with graphical results in Figs. 6 and 7.

PARAGRAPH

Inspection of Table 10 and Fig. 6 shows that seven obsidian sources exhibit large standard deviation values for the optical hydration rate, such that the coefficient of variation (CV) exceeds 0.20: (Crystal Springs, WY, CV = 0.87; Coso Sugarloaf Mountain, CA, CV = 0.31; Obsidian Cliffs, OR, CV = 0.26; Rio Hondo, Colombia, CV = 0.23; Superior, AZ, CV = 0.49; Timber Butte, ID, CV = 0.52; and Ucareo, Mexico, CV = 0.65).

Eq. (7) demonstrates that σm is increased when σd is increased, and also when the first derivative of the best-fit curve (∂w/∂d) is increased.

Further, as pointed out above, the calibration is most accurate when the second derivative of the best-fit curve is small.

All these factors contribute to the seven outlier cases.

PARAGRAPH

Inspection of Table 10 and Fig. 7 shows that five obsidian sources exhibit large standard deviation values of the mass gain hydration rate, such that the coefficient of variation of the mass rate exceeds 2.0: (Crystal Springs, WY, CV = 3.03; Obsidian Cliffs OR, CV = 9.24; Superior, AZ, CV = 3.68; Timber Butte, ID, CV = 3.53; and Ucareo, Mexico, CV = 2.16).

Furthermore, in each case the mean value of the rate is large, so, by Eq. (7) the standard deviation of the rate is expected to be large.

Furthermore, Eq. (12) shows that the coefficients of the intrinsic water terms are larger than in the case of optical microscopy (Eq. (6)), so again the effects of errors in water content are amplified.

SECTION

Hydration rates at other temperatures

SECTION

Optical measurement

PARAGRAPH

The hydration rates computed for Table 10 (see Appendix B for MatLab computer code) are at an effective hydration temperature of 20 °C (TK = 293.15 K).

Rates at other temperatures can be estimated by applying Eq. (9) to a new temperature, but such a procedure will not account for the Monte Carlo process.

A preferable method, for obsidian sources represented in Table 10, is to scale from the rates in the table.

The scaling equation is:kT2=k20∗expA1/293.15−A1/273.15+T2A1=10,433−1023∗wwhere: kT2 is the rate at temperature T2°C, w is the water content from Table 7, and k20 is the rate for this source from Table 10 for 20 °C.

PARAGRAPH

The standard deviation of the rate can also be scaled from Table 9 by the equation:σkT2=σk20∗B1∗kT2/B2∗k20B1=−2.289+1023∗w/273.15+T2B2=−2.289+1023∗w/293.15where: σkT2 is the standard deviation of the rate at temperature T2°C, σk20 is the standard deviation of the rate at 20 °C from Table 10, kT2 is the rate at temperature T2°C computed from Eqs. (18a), (18b), and the other variables are as defined above.

SECTION

Mass increase

Scaling hydration rates based on water mass increase for sources in in Table 10 follows a procedure similar to that for optical microscopy.

The scaling equation is:kT2=k20∗expA1/293.15−A1/273.15+T2A1=10,433−2857∗wwhere: kT2 is the rate at temperature T2°C, w is the water content from Table 7, and k20 is the rate for this source from Table 10 for 20 °C.

The standard deviation of the rate can also be scaled from Table 10 by the equation:σkT2=σk20∗B1∗kT2/B2∗k20B1=−5.196+2857∗w/273.15+T2B2=−5.196+2857∗w/293.15where: σkT2 is the standard deviation of the rate at temperature T2°C, σk20 is the standard deviation of the rate at 20 °C from Table 10, kT2 is the rate at temperature T2°C computed from Eq. (20b), and the other variables are as defined above.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this study we have developed a revised calibration that estimates the total structural water content (%H2Ot) of obsidian based upon density.

This is an improvement over the previous calibration of Ambrose and Stevenson (2004) (Fig. 8) in that: 1) the range of the calibration is increased from 1.19% to 1.66% H2Ot, and 2) the overall standard error of the prediction equation is less.

We attribute the greater precision of the calibration to a lower estimated error for each density measurement (0.0016 g/cm3 vs. 0.005 g/cm3) that may stem from a more precise temperature calibration of the immersion liquid.

PARAGRAPH

The two calibrations are similar in that each documents a two phase system.

In the density range of 2.52 to 2.35 g/cm3 hydroxyl (OH) dominates and increases slightly from 0.07% to 0.2%.

At densities below 2.35 g/cm3 there is an abrupt increase in H2Om concentration that leads to a steeply sloping trend line.

The major difference between the two calibrations occurs in the upper concentrations ranges for H2Ot.

Here the slope of the trend line is nearly vertical and then begins to decline at about 1.5% H2Ot.

We postulate that the dominance of hydroxyl at low concentrations represents molecularly bonded water to non-bridging oxygens in the alumino-silicate structure.

Above 0.2% OH, unbound water is present in molecular form as a result of incomplete degassing of the magma.

PARAGRAPH

The application of the new calibration to a predominantly western hemisphere sample of obsidian geological deposits reveals that 85% of obsidian flows in the sample (22 of 27) have mean intra-source structural water concentrations of <0.22% H2Ot.

This is however an underestimation since four additional sources (Coso, CA; Superior, AZ; Timber Butte, ID; Ucareo, Mexico) have flows with both low (<0.2%) and elevated (>0.2% H2Ot) structural water concentrations.

While our sample was not selected in a manner to be statistically representative, it does suggest that most obsidian sources will have a low structural water content range and fall within the linear range of the calibration (2.52–2.35 g/cm3).

However, it is equally clear that a significant number of sources will have multiple flows, or sub-sources, of varying H2Ot concentration (e.g., Stevenson et al., 1993) and it is important that a geological source should be thoroughly characterized to determine its water content variability.

PARAGRAPH

Our two case examples from Rapa Nui, Chile, and Red Hill, NM, represent the near extremes of what an archaeologist may encounter in the application of OHD to a region.

In the case of Rapa Nui, all of the obsidian deposits have low overall intra-source H2Ot levels (X-bar = 0.10% H2Ot) and low standard deviations associated with each source (±0.001–0.003% H2Ot).

In this case the impact of structural water estimates on age estimates will be low if source specific rate constants were applied using the mean values.

In contrast, the Red Hill source exhibits a very wide range in H2Ot concentration for the four sampling locations (X-bar = 0.17–1.38%H2Ot) and a large standard deviation (±0.17–0.62) around the mean.

Clearly, no one sample is representative of the obsidian source.

PARAGRAPH

The above data shows that the measurement of obsidian water content using the immersion method is a precise easily applied non-destructive method.

A greater accuracy in hydration rate may be determined by the analysis of each artifact density before application of the rate equations and dating of the artifact.

We see this procedure as preferable to the use of mean %H2Ot concentrations for geological sources or flows unless it has been demonstrated otherwise.

Conclusion

PARAGRAPH

Our sample of obsidian sources derived from the available materials in the archives of MURR demonstrates that the variability in intra-source structural water content can vary by in excess of 1% H2Ot.

As a result, using a geological source specific %H2Ot value for estimation of the Arrhenius constants for hydration rate calculation can lead to reduced accuracy in estimating age.

Rogers (2010) showed quantitatively that errors in the rate ascribed to a geochemical source are a major source of uncertainty.

In the application of OHD to a region it would be advisable to systematically sample the obsidian sources in the area to assess their variation in H2Ot.

In some instances it may be possible to use average values for archaeological artifacts originating from a single source but a more rigorous approach would be to estimate the H2Ot for each artifact using a density assessment.

Individual density determinations are inexpensive and >25 samples can be processed in a day.

This approach would assure the best possible estimate for a critical parameter in the OHD process.
