TITLE

Late Hellenistic and early Roman slumped and cast glass vessels from the House of Orpheus at Paphos, Cyprus. An interim report

PARAGRAPH

This paper provides the preliminary results from an integrated study of the Hellenistic and early Roman glass vessel assemblage from the large domestic context at Paphos named the House of Orpheus.

The homogeneous appearance of the omnipresent slumped and cast vessels in late Hellenistic and early Roman contexts within the entire Mediterranean makes it fairly complex to define the origin of specific assemblages when only studying the external features.

PARAGRAPH

We present here the results of a combined study of in-situ optical analysis by means of absorption spectroscopy and chemical analyses with SEM-EDS and LA-ICP-MS.

In a first step 107 fragments were optically analysed to categorize possible glass groups and 54 selected pieces were sampled to characterize their chemical composition.

Four optically defined glass types can be distinguished with respect to the use of a decolouring or colouring agent and the impact of the furnace condition.

The chemical analysis techniques define four distinct subgroups within the homogeneous cluster of Levantine glass.
