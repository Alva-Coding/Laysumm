TITLE

Late Hellenistic and early Roman slumped and cast glass vessels from the House of Orpheus at Paphos, Cyprus. An interim report

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Since 1983 (with a long break between 1992 and 2009) excavations have been conducted by Demetrios Michaelides in Nea Paphos at the site of the House of Orpheus.

These have brought to light a sequence of buildings, the earliest of which dates to the late 4th c. BC, and is more or less contemporary with the foundation of Nea Paphos.

The latest of the structures is a habitation dating to the mid-Roman period, which has been named the House of Orpheus, after the most important of its mosaics, which depict the mythical hero charming the beasts with his music (Michaelides 1991).

These different structures show that the site remained continuously occupied all through the Hellenistic and the Roman Imperial period up to the 4th c. AD, when Nea Paphos was devastated by destructive earthquakes.

After this date the area of the House of Orpheus appears to have been abandoned (Michaelides, 1983–1998, 1986, 1991a, 1991b).

PARAGRAPH

From the over 7500 so far recorded glass fragments recovered during the extended excavation period, we consider here only the Hellenistic to early Roman core-formed, cast or slumped vessel fragments numbering 262 pieces.

The Hellenistic and early Roman glass jewellery, utensils and counters are not taken into account, though well represented at the site, nor are the 1st–4th c. AD blown glass vessels.

An in-depth discussion of the entire glass assemblage including an intra-site evaluation of the glass material up to the period of abandonment of the house will be considered within a full excavation report of the site.

PARAGRAPH

This paper is to be considered an interim report providing a preliminary examination of the vessel forms covering the 3rd c. BC – 1st c. AD including grooved and linear-cut bowls, plain bowls, fluted bowls and bowls decorated with an abraded vegetal design, ribbed bowls, and cast vessels as well as one core-formed vessel (Fig. 1).

The first aim was to examine whether the glass used for making core-formed glass vessels is similar to that of the slumped and cast vessels.

Another was to verify whether two chunks of raw glass from the House of Orpheus are related to the late Hellenistic and early Roman vessel assemblage or whether they are of later date, when the glassblowing technique replaced the cast and slumping techniques.

Finally, the optical and chemical analyses of this large set of early glass assemblage is expected to characterize potential distinctive provenances of glass tableware supplying households in Nea Paphos.

PARAGRAPH

An assessment of the early glass from the Paphian House of Orpheus is important for a broader survey of the domestic consumption of vessel glass in the Hellenistic and early Roman period within the entire Mediterranean.

The debate concerning this subject commonly remains restricted to sites from the two established major production/consumption areas, i.e. the Aegean and the Levant.

The interest of including the House of Orpheus in this discourse is that Paphos was a major coastal city in the Hellenistic period (Młynarczyk, 1990; Ballandier, 2016) situated between these two regions.

It had strong connections with Egypt and the Levant, the traditional suppliers of raw glass and finished glass products, e.g. Beirut (Jennings, 2000, 2006; Foy, 2005), as well as with the Aegean, generally recognized as a region with secondary glass workshops, e.g. Rhodes (Weinberg, 1971; Triantafyllidis, 2000, 2003).

PARAGRAPH

Most sets of Hellenistic-early Roman glass vessels from Cypriot sites are small and come mainly from sanctuaries, e.g. the sanctuary of Apollo Hylates near Kourion (Grose, 1986), Geronisos opposite Agios Georgios of Peyia, allegedly an island sanctuary dedicated to Apollo (Burdajewicz, 2009) and the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Amathous (Nenna, 2006).

There is also some published material from public buildings, e.g. the Fabrika Hill at Paphos (McCall, 2016), and from burials, e.g. Amathous (Oliver, 1992) and Aphendrika (Dray and Plat Taylor, 1937–1939).

Recently, information from other Paphian domestic contexts (Mazanek, 2014, 2016a, b; McCall, 2016)1 has been made accessible providing an added value to the comparative study with, on the one hand, the large Hellenistic-early Roman assemblage from the House of Orpheus and, on the other, the early vessel glass consumption in Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean.

PARAGRAPH

It is generally accepted that the late Hellenistic cast glass vessels were produced in various workshops in the Aegean and the Levant/Syro-Palestinian coast, whereas it has been proposed that one or more Hellenistic glass workshops producing core-formed glass vessels were active in Cyprus (McClellan, 1984; Cosyns and Nys, 2010).

One of these glass workshops producing cast glass is thought to have been located in Rhodes (Triantafyllidis, 2000, 2003), but several other workshops were most likely active contemporaneously elsewhere in the Aegean (Jackson-Tal, 2004).

To the present, there is no identified workshop (Triantafyllidis, 2006) there, but one might well have existed at Tel Anafa, Israel, considering the huge amount of slumped glass vessels found within such a small settlement (Weinberg, 1970; Grose, 2012; Larson, 2016).

PARAGRAPH

Our endeavour was to define, through chemical characterization, the impact of Aegean and Levantine imports within the glass assemblage from the House of Orpheus.

Furthermore, we investigated whether the cast glass material from the House of Orpheus betrayed any evidence for local Cypriot production(s).

SECTION

Methodology

PARAGRAPH

An integrated discussion between typological and scientific methods is necessary in order to relate the Hellenistic-early Roman glass vessel assemblages from the House of Orpheus to Aegean and/or Levantine production centres.

Aware of many sites that yielded Hellenistic vessel glass (Nenna, 1999; Larson, 2016) the recorded material from the House of Orpheus is compared with available data of Aegean and Levantine sites (Table 1) in order to obtain a preliminary assessment.

PARAGRAPH

As a first step, the late Hellenistic and early Roman glass assemblage was analysed with the naked-eye, for features such as glass hue, decoration and shape.

This was done in order to quantify and obtain comparative data for an assessment with contemporary material from the set of selected sites in the Eastern Mediterranean listed in Table 1.

PARAGRAPH

The optical and chemical analyses, respectively absorption spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscope coupled with an Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (SEM-EDS) and Laser ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), have been applied in order to establish the elemental composition of the glass samples, identifying in this way the raw materials and the technology used.

Optical analysis by means of absorption spectroscopy is already a well-established qualitative method for defining fabric groups of archaeological glass artefacts (Meulebroeck et al., 2011, 2012; Cosyns et al., 2012; Ceglia et al., 2013; Ceglia et al., 2016).

The fact that this rapid and easy on-site method can be performed after polishing away the corrosion of a small section of the surface on both sides facilitates a careful sorting and excludes any random sample selection for chemical analysis as material can be selected based on their optical properties.

In total 107 fragments have been optically analysed.

The 54 samples selected for chemical analysis include seven pieces that were not measured with optical spectroscopy for various reasons: (1) the shape of the object (the two chunks of raw glass CYP52, CYP53), (2) the opacity of the glass (the core-formed vessel CYP54), or (3) because the obtained spectra were inaccurate (the slumped and cast vessels CYP3, CYP7, CYP15, CYP18) (see Appendix A).

In addition, through the application of such physicochemical techniques we are able to verify whether the House of Orpheus assemblage of late Hellenistic and early Roman slumped and cast glass vessels originates from different production centres.

SECTION

UV–vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy

PARAGRAPH

The in-situ set-up at the Archaeological District Museum of Paphos consisted of two light sources from Avantes, the DHS-BAL deuterium lamp for the UV and the Avalight-HAL for the vis-NIR region, a focusing lens, an integrating sphere to collect the transmitted light and a spectrometer.

The light from the lamps is conducted via a bifurcated optical fibre and focussed at the entrance of the integrating sphere with a spot size smaller than 4 mm2.

The spectrometer records the UV–vis-NIR spectral range between 200 nm and 1650 nm.

To remove the weathering layers covering archaeological glass affecting the optical aspect, about 5 × 5 mm of the glass surface was polished using a hand-held Dremel rotary tool prior to the in-situ transmission measurements.

To minimize the effects of the curvature of the glass fragments and eventual polishing defects, an integrating sphere was used to collect all the light that is transmitted (Ceglia et al., 2016).

To normalize the optical spectra, the thickness of each sample was measured using a digital micrometer with 0.001 mm resolution normalized to 1 mm of thickness.

In addition, reflection losses were subtracted in order to interpret quantitatively the spectral measurements (Ceglia et al., 2016, 615) and the colour coordinates of the optical spectra have been calculated in the CIE Lab system normalized to the standard illuminant D65 (Meulebroeck et al., 2011).

SECTION

SEM-EDS

PARAGRAPH

For the detection of major and minor oxides SEM-EDS was carried out at the Laboratory of Archaeometry of the University of the Peloponnese by using a JEOL (JSM-6510LV) scanning electron microscope, coupled with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer Oxford instruments.

The glass samples, cut in cross sections to avoid any weathered surfaces, were embedded into acrylic resin blocks and were mechanically ground with silicon carbide paper.

To obtain a smooth surface of unaltered glass on which SEM-EDS measurements could be performed without interference from the corroded surface layers of the glass fragments, the surface of the resin blocks were polished with diamond paste up to 1 μm.

Each sample was measured at least 5 times for 300 s and the mean value of the measurements was calculated.

All samples were analysed under high vacuum to avoid any interaction of air molecules with the electron beam and Xrays, with an operating voltage at 20 kV and working distance for each sample of 15 mm.

Spot size of the electron beam was set at 40 allowing a scanning surface of 300 × 400 μm at ×100 magnification.

The analytical data were obtained by INKA software, using the built-in calibration protocol.

Precision of the technique was established by analysing standard reference materials (NIST SRM610, SRM620 and SRM1412) (Palamara et al., 2016).

The analyses are in close agreement with the expected values, and the relative error between the expected and measured values is approximately 5% for most of the oxides (Table 2).

SECTION

LA-ICP-MS

PARAGRAPH

The LA-ICP-MS facility at the British Geological Survey in Keyworth, Nottingham, uses a NewWave UP193FX excimer (193 nm) laser system with built in microscope imaging coupled to an Agilent 7500 series ICP-MS for the identification of trace elements in ppm levels.

Prior to analysis the surface of each block and the glass standards were cleaned by rubbing a tissue soaked in dilute acid for a few seconds.

The sample block was then placed in a simple single volume ablation cell with NIST glass standards SRM610 and 612.

The measurements followed the protocol presented in more detail in Henderson et al. (2016).

The laser was fired for 45 s at 10 Hz and a typical fluence of 2.8 Jcm−2, ablating craters of 75 μm.

Before a series of ablations were carried out on the glass samples, the calibration standards and the quality control standards, data were collected in a time resolved analysis mode, comprising the measurement of a gas blank.

Calibration of the system was performed using NIST SRM610 as trace element glass standard, and NIST SRM612 was used for quality control purposes.

The accuracy and precision of the method is shown in Table 3.

The resin blocks used in SEM/EDS analysis were also used for the LA-ICP-MS method.

Results

SECTION

The archaeological data

PARAGRAPH

The examined glass vessel assemblage comprises the excavated material up to the campaign of 2012.

As already mentioned, all 262 fragments are cast or slumped bowls except for one single vessel piece made with the core-formed technique (Table 4).

PARAGRAPH

Although the earliest phase at the site of the House of Orpheus dates back to the foundation of Nea Paphos around the end of the 4th c. BC (Michaelides 1991, 5), the early Hellenistic levels (4th to mid–2nd c. BC) have yielded no glass.

None of the late 4th–early 3rd c. BC or late 3rd-early 2nd c. BC glass vessels as reported from the Delian houses (Nenna, 1999, 59–63) have been attested within the House of Orpheus assemblage with the exception of a neck fragment of a small core-formed amphoriskos of type MG III-Amphoriskos 5B (Harden 1981) dated 250–150 BCE (Fig. 1a).

As in most other contexts within the Mediterranean, the early glass vessels of the House of Orpheus largely fall within the second half of the 2nd c. BC up to the 1st c. AD, when glass commodities became more affordable.

It has to be born in mind however, that the earlier levels of the site were only minimally investigated (mainly through deep sondages) given the obstacles posed by the later overlying structures.

In any case, it would appear that this change in glass consumption, with the introduction of glass tableware within domestic contexts, coincides with the establishment of a self-administration with a dèmos, a boulè and a grammateus of the ‘City of Paphians’, around the mid–2nd c. BC (Vitas, 2016, 245).

PARAGRAPH

The vessels, shaped by slumping a glass disc over a form, are all open vessels and more specifically shallow and deep bowls.

The House of Orpheus mainly yielded the ubiquitous conical or hemispherical grooved bowls (Fig. 1b) and the younger shallow linear-cut bowls (Fig. 1c).

Less common are externally grooved bowls (Fig. 1d), ribbed bowls (Fig. 1f) and fluted bowls (Fig. 1g), whereas plain bowls (Fig. 1e), bowls with an abraded vegetal design (Fig. 1i), and beaded bowls (Fig. 1h) appear isolated (Table 4).

PARAGRAPH

The cast vessels are limited to monochrome decoloured dishes and cups with a wide overhanging rim (Fig. 1j).

PARAGRAPH

The early glass vessel assemblage from the House of Orpheus coincides with Levantine sites (Jennings, 2000, 2006; Foy, 2005).

All studied material is made in a monochrome glass, mainly decoloured or pale coloured, while deeply coloured glass is uncommon.

With the exception of the single core-formed amphoriskos, no polychrome glass vessel types such as striped, composite and gold-band mosaic or inlaid vessels have been recorded, something that contrasts with their relative frequency at Aegean sites (Weinberg, 1961; Nenna, 1999; Triantafyllidis, 2003, 2006).

On the other hand, the fluted bowls and bowls decorated on the outside with an abraded vegetal design are considered to be Aegean productions (O'Hea 2006/7; 2011; Reade and Privat, 2016, 10).

The archaeometric data

SECTION

UV–vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy

PARAGRAPH

In total 107 pieces or about 41% of the entire set of 262 Hellenistic and early Roman pieces have been measured in order to obtain an adequate sample selection.

In Appendix A are reported the Lab colour coordinates, Max T (the wavelength where there is the maximum transmission in the visible range) and Fe2+ concentration in wt% calculated following the method described in Ceglia et al., 2015a, b.

PARAGRAPH

The plot of the colour coordinate a and b is shown in Fig. 2.

Negative values of a indicate a green colour, positive values a red colour.

For the coordinate b, negative corresponds to a blue colour, while positive stands for yellow.

The distance from the centre indicates the intensity of the colour.

Three blue glasses (B), CYP11, CYP 56 and CYP57, are well apart from the rest of the fragments analysed with strongly negative b values, while one purple glass (P), CYP58, has positive a values.

All decoloured glasses (D) are very near the origin, with slightly positive values of b, while blue green (B-G), green (G), yellow-green (Y-G) and amber (A) glasses form a continuum distribution that moves from the negative b values towards the positive b values.

PARAGRAPH

Colouring agents are easily identified by analysing the optical spectra.

The three blue glasses are coloured by cobalt ions, Co2+, characterized by its typical triplet band in the visible at 535 nm, 595 nm and 650 nm (Fig. 3a) (Bamford, 1977).

The first absorption band position is sensible to the matrix composition; when it occurs at 535 nm, the glass has a soda-lime-silica composition (Green and Hart, 1987; Bacci and Picollo, 1996; Ceglia et al., 2012; Fornacelli et al., 2018).

In figure A, we report also a pale blue glass, CYP4, which has only 9 ppm of cobalt, but still detected by optical spectroscopy.

Using the intensity of the absorption of the band at 535 nm in the glasses CYP4 and CYP11 which were analysed by LA-ICP-MS and have respectively 9 and 300 ppm of Co, we made a correlation line which allows us to estimate that CYP56 and CYP57 were coloured with ca. 600 and ca. 850 ppm of cobalt respectively.

Purple glass is coloured with manganese in its trivalent state, Mn3+, characterized by an asymmetric absopriton band centered at about 500 nm (Bamford, 1977).

The spectrum of the purple glass CYP58 is shown in Fig. 3b.

PARAGRAPH

The majority of the glass is either decoloured or has a colour ranging from pale blue over green and yellow to amber.

Glass decolouring was obtained by using manganese to oxidize iron according to the following reaction:Mn3++Fe2+➔Mn2++Fe3+

PARAGRAPH

Mn2+ does not absorb light in the visible region, while Fe3+ is only weakly absorbing.

In Fig. 4, it can be noticed that when an excess of Mn3+ is present, some residual absorption at 500 nm is evident, and shifts the hue to more purplish tinges.

This is evident for samples CYP16 and CYP5, both decoloured with manganese.

However CYP16 has 7300 ppm of Mn, while CYP5 has 13,000 ppm in view of a similar amount of iron, correspondingly 0.27 and 0.3 wt% Fe2O3.

Consequently some of the Mn3+ does not react for sample CYP5 resulting in a more positive a colour coordinate.

PARAGRAPH

Concerning naturally coloured glasses the range of colours is due to the different amount of iron and sulphur.

Ancient glasses without the addition of manganese are strongly reduced, i.e. about 50–60% of the iron in the Fe2+ state (see also Ceglia et al., 2014 and Ceglia et al., 2016 for a more detailed discussion on the topic).

However, when the redox power of the batch increases, e.g. by adding carbon either intentionally or not, sulphur gets reduced to the S2− state and forms the ferri-sulphide complex Fe-S with the remaining iron in its trivale state.

This typically happens when the ratio Fe2+/Fetot is between 70 and 90%.

In Fig. 4, it can be noticed that moving from blue-green to green, yellow and amber colours, the absorption of the Fe-S complex at 410–420 nm increases.

Ancient glassmakers were able to control the colour by only playing on the redox conditions of the batch, that is by adding carbon to reduce the glass or manganese to oxydize it.

PARAGRAPH

Thanks to the study of glasses analysed with chemical methods, it is possible to interpret also the optical spectra of the fragments analysed only by optical spectroscopy.

In Fig. 5, we plot the b colour coordinate against the position of the maximum transmission in the visible region.

Decoloured glass clusters very well with b values around zero and maximum transmission in the region 700–750 nm.

Naturally coloured glass instead, has variable values according to the strength of the Fe-S band, which shifts the maximum transmission to higher wavelengths and increases the b colour coordinates.

SECTION

Chemical analysis

PARAGRAPH

To associate the four distinctive spectral groups with specific, recognized chemical groups it was essential to corroborate the qualitative measurements obtained from absorption spectroscopy with their chemical composition.

From the 54 chemically analysed samples in total 47 were optically examined.

An assessment of the acquired optical spectra and chemical compositions offers a potential advance in defining the origin of production or the production period.

The sampling includes four more sagged bowls that were not optically analysed, as well as the two chunks of raw glass and the core-formed vessel.

From the 51 sagged bowls 23 examples are grooved bowls, 19 linear-cut bowls, 7 externally grooved bowls, and 2 plain bowls (see Appendix A).

SECTION

SEM-EDS

PARAGRAPH

The sampled items from the House of Orpheus were manufactured using two standard raw materials, which introduced three components necessary for the formation of glass (Brill, 1988): a silica source acting as network former, an alkali source, acting as network modifier or fluxing agent and lime acting as a stabilizing agent.

The majority of glass produced between 800 BCE and 800 CE was manufactured according to an unchanged use of raw materials/ingredients (Henderson, 2013; Degryse, 2014).

As expected, the basic silica source was sand containing, among other, specific oxides as impurities in typical levels, such as Al2O3 (≃2.2 wt%) and Fe2O3 (≃0.3 wt%).

The use of a fluxing agent lowers the melting temperature to fuse sand (Brems and Degryse, 2014a, 2014b), which was during this period commonly a mineral form of flux, the so-called natron and/or trona, resulting in a consistent glass composition of major and minor oxides from the early 1st millennium BC to late Antiquity (Henderson, 2013; Degryse, 2014; Larson, 2016).

The SEM-EDS analysis results from the selected samples (Table 5) clearly indicate the use of natron (Na2CO3·10H2O) and/or trona (Na2CO3·Na2HCO3·2H2O), which is characterized by low magnesium (MgO) and potassium (K2O) values <1 wt% (≃0.6 wt% and 0.6% wt respectively) (Fig. 6b).

Besides the low amount of MgO and K2O the sodium based mineral source of the alkali incorporates also impurity levels of sulphur and chlorine and in few cases magnesium as demonstrated recently on the natron analysis from el-Barnugi (Egypt) (Jackson et al., 2018).

PARAGRAPH

Furthermore, the lime is most likely derived from the sand in the form of crushed shells rather than being a deliberate addition (Freestone et al., 2003; Henderson, 2013).

This lime component of the sands is crucial for the formation of the base glass composition and therefore scholars have shown that not all sands are suitable for glassmaking (Degryse, 2014; Blomme et al., 2016).

Also ancient writers such as Pliny the Elder (NH XXXVI, 190–194) mentions in the late 1st c. AD only few locations with raw materials suitable for glassmaking, including, for sand, the Belus river estuary, on the coast close to Akko, in present-day Israel, and the Volturno river bay in southern Italy.

PARAGRAPH

The bi-plot shows a typically correlated silica-soda match with the silica averaging between 66 and 72 wt%.

and soda levels between 15 and 19 wt%.

of the sampled glasses from the House of Orpheus.

The separated dot is the yellow opaque glass trail on the core-formed vessel because of the high level of lead due to the use of lead-antimonate.

The two other dots are samples of decoloured linear-cut bowls (CYP37; CYP40) showing soda levels around 22 wt%.

One would expect that the more silica, the more alkali (in this case soda) is needed to melt the sand at a specific temperature.

Conversely, the opposite behaviour is true as the majority of the samples show a negative correlation between silica and soda with the exception of two linear-cut bowls in decoloured glass (Fig. 6).

Samples having more silica (the samples on the higher left part of Fig. 6) tend to have a lower amount of soda (Table 5).

This in turn could lead to the assumption that these specific samples were manufactured using different expertise and/or recipe (e.g. raw materials melted at higher temperatures).

Of course, we cannot exclude the possibility that these variations might not be significant and might be due to the inhomogeneity of raw materials especially sand and the presence of other oxides e.g. CaO which might well affect the melting behaviour of the batch (Shugar and Rehren, 2002; Rehren, 2008).

PARAGRAPH

We can conclude that the homogeneity of the glass matrix indicates the use of a very standardized sand based silica-soda-lime composition with a lime content ranging from 5 to 9 wt%.

and an alumina level ranging from 1.9 to 2.5 wt%.

Table 6 demonstrates that the samples from the House of Orpheus fall into the general silica-soda-lime category (Sayre and Smith, 1961) and therefore they have corresponding values in the major and minor oxides to coeval samples from other regions: Israel, Greece, Syria and Lebanon (Nenna, 1999; Thirion-Merle, 2005; Grose, 2012; Reade and Privat, 2016).

SECTION

LA-ICP-MS

PARAGRAPH

LA-ICP MS analysis is a powerful technique for the investigation of the trace elements existing in ancient glass compositions.

The analysis provided data for 40 trace elements, but in the present study, we took into consideration only six specific trace elements, namely manganese (Mn), barium (Ba), strontium (Sr), titanium (Ti), chromium (Cr) and vanadium (V), which are not associated with the colorants (Table 7).

The identification of trace elements has been widely used in the last 15 years in ancient glass analyses and has proved to be a powerful tool for provenance studies (e.g. Shortland et al., 2007; Walton et al., 2009; Jackson and Nicholson, 2010; Gratuze, 2014; Henderson et al., 2016; Oikonomou et al., 2016; Coutinho et al., 2017; Blomme et al., 2017; Ceglia et al., 2017).

Trace elements can be associated with the local geology of the raw materials and because some of them are not affected by the glassmaking procedure they can be used as technological and provenance discriminants (Degryse, 2014).

PARAGRAPH

Mn was added deliberately to the glass batch and was used, depending on the occasion, as a colourant or more frequently as a decolourant (Brems and Degryse, 2014a, 2014b and references therein).

When Mn is used as a decolourant it is often associated with Ba, and both elements are positively correlated (Paynter, 2006; Foster and Jackson, 2010).

In the case of the samples from Cyprus, Fig. 7 shows that both elements are strongly correlated (r2 = 0.83), indicating the use of psilomelane ((Ba,H2O)2Mn5O10) (Jackson, 2005), but Mn is also strongly linearly correlated with V, Ni, Zn and Mo (Fig. 8) what has been associated to psilomelane from the southeast region of the Sinai in particular in relation to Mo (Ayalon et al., 1985).

Furthermore, on Fig. 7 we can distinguish three groups with low, middle and high Mn content (indicated by the ellipses).

These three groups have been attested for the glass from Jebel Khalid, Syria (Reade and Privat, 2016, Fig. 4), where the high Mn levels are associated with purely to imperfectly decoloured glass, the middle group is featuring the pale green, amber and blue glasses, and the amber and onther coloured glasses with low manganese levels.

PARAGRAPH

Sr is associated with the source of calcium (Wedepohl and Baumann, 2000; Freestone et al., 2003).

High Sr concentrations of 300–600 ppm indicate the use of shell fragments (Brems et al., 2014; Brems and Degryse, 2014a, 2014b) which are usually found as impurities in sands, and therefore Sr can be an indirect discriminant of sands.

PARAGRAPH

Ti, Cr and V can be associated either with iron oxides or with heavy minerals such as rutile, ilmenite, titanite and chromite (Wedepohl et al., 2011; Brems and Degryse, 2014a, 2014b).

All of these are usually found in sands as impurities.

Fig. 9a–d shows that there are no significant correlations between these elements.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

A full detailed discussion on the vessel shapes is not possible here as it would require a thorough study of the different assemblages already published in order to make a concordance of the diverse subdivisions and different descriptions.

Table 4 demonstrates that the bulk material is of grooved and linear-cut bowls which include conical and hemispherical shapes, shallow and deep, and this in a variety of glass hues.

These vessels mainly have one or more parallel grooves on the interior of the vessel just below the rim and/or somewhat deeper just above the base.

Only a few examples display grooves on the exterior.

This decoration pattern is considered characteristic to the ovoid shaped grooved bowls, as from Marresha (Jackson-Tal, 2004).

Most rims are straight but some have an everted S-shaped rim.

Besides a small number of plain conical and hemispherical slumped bowls, a small set of decorated bowls have been catalogued: bowls with fluted, floral/vegetal, ribbed bowls or beaded design imitating contemporaneous metal ware and relief pottery.

While the grooved bowls are considered to come from the Syro-Palestinian coast, the decorated shapes are said to be Aegean productions (Jackson-Tal, 2004; Triantafyllidis, 2006; Reade and Privat, 2016).

PARAGRAPH

A first comment on an integrated discussion between the vessel types, absorption groups and chemical groups is that the glass of the mid-Hellenistic core-formed vessel (CYP54) is slightly different from the late Hellenistic and early Roman sampled cast and slumped cups and bowls.

The blue glass of the core-formed vessel contains a slightly more elevated concentration of iron oxides and potash, respectively 0.87% and 0.94 wt% whereas all other samples fall within the range of 0.09–0.39 wt% with the exception of 0.52 wt% for (CYP15) and 0.69 wt% for (CYP11) for the iron oxide and of 0.31–0.81 wt% for the potash.

The trace elements of both the blue and yellow glass show a very high level of arsenicum (As), respectively 12.84 ppm and 24.23 ppm, while all other samples range between 0.82 ppm and 3.98 ppm, with the exception of one linear-cut bowl in pale yellow-green glass with 6.02 ppm (CYP15).

Instead, the strontium level is relatively low, respectively 458.67 ppm and 373.67 ppm, compared to the main concentrations ranging from 450 ppm to 717 ppm, with the exception again of the pale yellow-green linear-cut bowl (CYP15) with 791.73 ppm.

PARAGRAPH

The chemical composition of all late Hellenistic and early Roman vessels of the House of Orpheus implies a quite homogeneous composition (Figs. 6 and 9).

This homogeneity is also noticed when checking the glass hues and various vessel shapes, since no relation can be observed between the chemical compostion and the different glass hues (Fig. 10a) or the different shapes (Fig. 10b).

So in contrast to the discussion from an archaeological approach all different glass vessel shapes of the House of Orpheus seem to have one single provenance.

However, it is more likely that the secondary glass workshops within the Eastern Mediterranean were widely supplied by raw glass made from a single longlasting recipe that has to be attributed to one source, i.e. (northern) Levant.

We have to take into consideration that the very close proximity of Cyprus to the Levantine coast as well as the prevailing sea currents and main wind-driven circulations (Cosyns and Ceglia, 2018, 75–78) made Cyprus easily reachable from the Levantine coast, a region with great tradition in glassmaking during the late Hellenistic period (Grose, 1979; Jennings, 2000; Jackson-Tal, 2004; Foy, 2005; Larson, 2016) and Roman period (Brill, 1988; Grose, 1991; Jennings, 2006).

In addition, trade activities between Cyprus and the Levant took place for many centuries (Lund, 1999, 2006; Fenn and Römer-Strehl, 2013) and therefore we may assume that glass (either as an object or as raw glass for a secondary glassmaking workshop) is most likely coming from the Syro-Palestinan coast rather than the other big glassmaking center of the era which can be located in Egypt and especially in Alexandria (Nenna, 2015).

Conclusion

PARAGRAPH

A first observation resulting from the study of the glass assemblage from the earliest levels below the House of Orpheus is the total absence of glass tableware of the post-Classical and the early and mid-Hellenistic periods (4th to mid–2nd c. BC).

The only early glass vessel present is one single core-formed perfume bottle dated to the period between the mid–3rd and the mid–2nd c. BC.

The assemblage confirms the general absence of glass in early Hellenistic domestic contexts and the largely privileged curiosity value of glass tableware in this phase (Grose, 1989).

A second observation is that, from the second half of the 2nd c. BC, glass tableware became an abundant consumer good for the inhabitants of the structures under the House of Orpheus; and this corroborates the general impression derived from settlements and shipwrecks within the Mediterranean and the Celtic world.

This observation confirms that the eastern Mediterranean experienced a commercial boom in the late Hellenistic period.

This was due to the increasingly growing impact of Rome on trade and, consequently, on the production of glass and pottery.

The third observation is that the glass assemblage we have studied appears more connected to Levantine rather than to Aegean production, whereas the 1st c. AD monochrome decoloured cast tableware imitates Roman metal ware as does sigillata ware.

The 1st c. AD linear-cut bowls and ribbed bowls from below the House of Orpheus are to be related to Levantine workshops, while the cast glassware was imported from Italy, as was the Italian sigillata.

Absorption spectroscopy defined four different optical groups, two coloured groups (blue and purple glass), one naturally coloured and the decoloured glass.

The naturally coloured glass goes from pale blue to amber, which required a different technological procedure i.e. the addition of carbon.

According to the Mn/Fe ratio the decoloured glass was more or less colourless, but always embraces a tinge going from slightly yellow-green to purplish.

The observation of four specific clustering sets within one homogeneous Levantine glass group, based on chemical analyses, confirms this observation.

At this stage, we cannot rule out possible chronological shifting from the mid-2nd c. BC to the 1st c. AD.

Besides the four connected subgroups, it is clear that the earlier core-formed vessel is made of a different glass, and so are the two pale blue-green glass chunks, which probably date from the 2nd–3rd c. AD.

Lastly, we can say that these promising results from the combined archaeological, optical and chemical analyses of the early glass from the site of the House of Orpheus demonstrates the great potential of a large-scale research project.

This would be directed at defining different glass groups and different glass recipes in relation to specific vessel types of the Hellenistic and early Roman period, which can eventually be linked to specific glass workshops.
