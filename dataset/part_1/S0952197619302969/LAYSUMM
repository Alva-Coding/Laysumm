TITLE

A population-based iterated greedy algorithm for no-wait job shop scheduling with total flow time criterion

PARAGRAPH

The no-wait constraint widely exists in real production environments, e.g. steel-making industry and concrete manufacturing.

The no-wait job shop problem with total flow time minimization is formulated asa mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model and decomposed into timetabling and sequencing subproblems.

A population-based iterated greedy (PBIG) algorithm is proposed.

In the algorithm, individuals evolve in parallel by means of a destruction and construction perturbator and an insertion-based local search.

Computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art metaheuristics.
