TITLE

Can the combination of hyperthermia, seizures and ion channel dysfunction cause fatal post-ictal cerebral edema in patients with SCN1A mutations?

PARAGRAPH

A 21 year-old male with Dravet Syndrome (DS) died of the consequences of brain swelling 3 hours after a seizure occurring during physical activity.

Cases of fatal brain swelling in patients with sodium channel mutations - a characteristic of DS - after fever or prolonged seizures have been reported raising the question whether sodium channel dysfunction may contribute to brain swelling and thereby to the high mortality in DS.

We report on our patient and discuss whether the combination of increased temperature and sodium channel dysfunction may not only trigger seizures but also a fatal cascade leading to cardio-respiratory collapse.
