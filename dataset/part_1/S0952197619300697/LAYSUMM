TITLE

A new metric for individual stock trend prediction

PARAGRAPH

This paper proposed a new metric to address the profit bias in the stock market prediction.

Previous studies mainly focused on proposing effective approaches to make profits.

However, there is an ineffectiveness in model evaluation due to the inconsistency between a model's performance and profitability.

In order to address the profit bias in model evaluation, we propose a new effective metric, Mean Profit Rate (MPR).

The using of MPR enable evaluating models profit-bias free.
