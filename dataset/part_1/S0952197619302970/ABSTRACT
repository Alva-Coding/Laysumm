TITLE

Performance analysis of Chaotic Multi-Verse Harris Hawks Optimization: A case study on solving engineering problems

PARAGRAPH

In recent years, several optimization algorithms are proposed, one of them is Multi-Verse Optimizer (MVO).

In this paper, a modified version of MVO is proposed, called CMVHHO, which uses the chaos theory and the Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO).

The main aim of using the chaotic maps in the proposed method is to determine the optimal value for the parameters of the basic MVO.

Besides, the HHO is used as a local search to improve the ability of the MVO to exploit the search space.

The performance of the CMVHHO is conducted using a set of chaotic maps to determine the most suitable map, as well as, the different experiments are performed to determine which parameter has the largest effect on the effectiveness of the MVO.

Moreover, the performance of the CMVHHO is compared with a set of state-of-the-art algorithms to find the best solution for global optimization problems.

Furthermore, the proposed CMVHHO with the best map is applied to solve four well-known engineering problems.

The experimental results illustrate that the chaotic Circle map is the best map among all maps because it improved the performance of the CMVHHO, as well as the HHO, affected positively in the behavior of the proposed algorithm.

The CMVHHO showed the best results than other algorithms in terms of the performance measures as well as in engineering problems and it outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithms in all problems.
