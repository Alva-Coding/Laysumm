TITLE

A case of auditory disturbance caused by lacosamide

PARAGRAPH

Changing auditory pitch perception is known as a side effect of the traditional anti-seizure drug carbamazepine in some patients.

However, auditory disturbance has not been previously reported as a side effect of lacosamide, a third-generation anti-seizure drug, blocks sodium channels, as also seen with carbamazepine.

This report presents a first case of pitch perception deficit associated with lacosamide, we outline features seen in our patient and compare our findings with those of previous reports describing carbamazepine-associated auditory disturbance.
