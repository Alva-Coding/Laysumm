TITLE

Mobility and trade in Mediterranean antiquity: Evidence for an ‘Italian connection’ in Mycenaean Greece revealed by ancient DNA of livestock

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

The Late Bronze Age (ca. 1700/1600 BCE–1050 BCE), was a period of an upsurge in interconnections between societies around the Mediterranean basin.

These patterns of connectivity were driven by trade in precious raw materials and finished objects of metal, ivory, glass/faience, wood, pottery, etc. (Burns, 2010; Cline, 1994, 2007).

Human mobility during this period ranging from travels of individuals to migration of entire groups of people also enhanced the dissemination of knowledge, materials and objects (Burns, 2010; Cline, 2007).

PARAGRAPH

The site of Tiryns, situated in the Argolid, a fertile plain in the Northeast of the Peloponnese, Greece, was one of the political centers of Mycenaean Greece during the palatial period (ca. 1400–1200 BCE) and post-palatial period (ca. 1200–1050 BCE).

In this study, we focus on settlement contexts dating to the period between 1250 and 1050 BCE which comprises the transition between the late palatial period (Late Helladic [LH] IIIB) (ca. 1300–1200 BCE) and the post-palatial period (LH IIIC) (ca. 1200–1050 BCE).

This span of roughly 200 years saw the destruction of the Mycenaean palaces (ca. 1200 BCE) and the resurgence of Tiryns as one of the most important sites of the Northeastern Peloponnese in the 12th century BCE (Maran, 2009; Maran, 2015).

The special position of post-palatial Tiryns is reflected in processes of political restoration and architectural expansion that are unprecedented in other regions of Greece (Maran, 2010; Maran, 2015; Maran, 2016).

Tiryns is also one of the key sites for understanding patterns of inter-societal connectivity in the Late Bronze Age Eastern Mediterranean.

It served as an important harbor for supra-regional exchange during the palatial period and was able to reestablish this position during the post-palatial period (Maran, 2012; Maran, 2004).

Long-term excavations at Tiryns have provided rich evidence for relations with Crete, the Levant, Cyprus and Italy during the 13th and 12th cents BCE.

PARAGRAPH

Whereas the material evidence of this intercultural network has been amply discussed as regards pottery and small finds of foreign derivation (Belardelli and Bettelli, 1999; Cohen et al., 2010; Davis et al., 2014; Kardamaki et al., 2016; Kilian, 2007; Kostoula and Maran, 2012; Stockhammer, 2015; Vetters, 2011), human and animal remains have yet to be used as sources for gaining insights into such issues.

In the meantime, the rich tool-box of scientific analysis enables us for the first time to shed light on mobility and trade connections during the Mycenaean palatial and post-palatial periods through the study of animal remains.

SECTION

The archaeozoology of Tiryns

PARAGRAPH

Archaeozoological studies in Tiryns have provided important information on the use of domestic animals in different phases of the Bronze Age of Tiryns (Morgenstern, 2016; von den Driesch and Boessneck, 1990).

The results of the new investigations of Tiryns, carried out by Morgenstern (2016), are based on the analysis of >15,384 faunal remains dated to LH IIIB and IIIC in three excavations.

In general, the remains exhibit a high degree of fragmentation, characteristic of Late Helladic faunal remains (Cosmopoulos et al., 2003; Forstenpointer et al., 2006; Reese, 1998, 2007, 2008).

About two-thirds of faunal remains were assignable to specific animal species (Morgenstern, 2016).

The largest part (>98%) of the assemblage represents bones from domestic mammals (of sheep/goats, cattle, and pigs).

Numerically, sheep and goat are the most abundant taxa followed by cattle and pig in LH IIIB and LH IIIC.

There is a small change in the number of sheep, goats and pigs at the transition between LH IIIB to LH IIIC, but the number of cattle rises and it becomes more dominant in LH IIIC (Morgenstern, 2014).

PARAGRAPH

Cattle were almost exclusively slaughtered at an adult age, while sheep and goats were slaughtered as either subadults or adults (Morgenstern, 2016).

The preponderance of adult individuals suggests that they were exploited for secondary products (e.g., milk, wool and traction labor).

Dental eruption patterns suggest that the majority of pigs were killed as juveniles or subadults, which means that pigs were kept to provide meat.

PARAGRAPH

An intra-skeletal distribution analysis revealed that all regions of the skeleton of domestic mammals are represented in the assemblages (Morgenstern, 2016).

The sex determination characterized by the size of canine tooth of pig shows a normal frequency distribution.

That suggests that the majority of pigs discovered in Tiryns were not traded, but bred locally (Morgenstern, 2014).

An additional purchase of pigs through exchange networks would probably represent a surplus-number of young male individuals.

PARAGRAPH

The question of whether the composition of livestock has undergone changes due the introduction of new animal breeds is almost impossible to answer using traditional morphological analysis alone.

Therefore, using morphology, the parsimonious assumption was that the most frequent Late Bronze Age domestic animals sheep, goat, cattle and pigs descended from breeds introduced to the region at the beginning of the Neolithic and indigenously bred since that time (Larson et al., 2005; Larson et al., 2007; Troy et al., 2001).

The possibility that, in the course of younger prehistory, not only new species of domestic animals, such as equids, but also new breeds of already established domestic animals may have been spread by patterns of societal mobility and exchange only came to the fore with the advent of DNA-analyses.

This has revolutionized our understanding of the heterogeneous and entangled origins of the livestock of Neolithic, Chalcolithic and Bronze Age societies in the Aegean (Beja-Pereira et al., 2006; Meiri et al., 2017).

PARAGRAPH

Ancient DNA of domestic animals has proven a valuable tool to illuminate patterns of trade, interconnections and mobility of humans in ancient times (Beja-Pereira et al., 2006; Larson, 2012; Larson et al., 2007; Pellecchia et al., 2007).

Previous studies have provided evidence for connections with regard to the transport of domestic animals between the Aegean region and the southern Levant and Anatolia in the Late Bronze Age (Meiri et al., 2013; Meiri et al., 2017).

Ancient DNA studies suggest translocation of pigs from Greece to the southern Levant occurred no later than ca. 900 BCE, and between Greece and Anatolia during the whole of the Bronze Age (3500–1150 BCE) (Meiri et al., 2013; Meiri et al., 2017).

This fits well with the conclusion reached on the basis of the study of other archaeological finds such as pottery and a variety of small finds (Cline, 2007; Rahmstorf, 2011).

PARAGRAPH

We study segments of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of pig and cattle, to examine whether there is evidence to suggest that the major historical changes, accompanying the transition between the palatial and post-palatial periods, may have affected the genetic structure of these livestock species.

We use bone and teeth samples from Tiryns, a major site of Mycenaean Greece over time, to gain insights into the genetic composition of the livestock used during these times.

Material and methods

SECTION

Sample collections and archaeological find contexts

PARAGRAPH

20 pig (Sus scrofa domesticus) and 35 cattle (Bos taurus) bones and teeth were selected among archaeozoological remains from three recent excavations (in 2000, 2002–2003 and 2014–2015) in different areas of Mycenaean Tiryns (Supplementary Table 1).

The bones came from excavations in the Late Helladic IIIC (LH IIIC; ca. 1200–1050 BCE) Northern Lower Town, namely the Northeastern Lower Town (2000; 6 bones) (Maran and Papadimitriou, 2006) and the Northwestern Lower Town (2014–2015; 18 bones) (Maran and Papadimitriou, 2006; Maran and Papadimitriou, 2016), and from an excavation in the northernmost part of the Lower Citadel (2002–2003; 31 bones), where a stratigraphic sequence of layers belonging to the final palatial period (LH IIIB2) and the early to advanced stage of LH IIIC was investigated (Maran, 2008).

All bones selected for archaeozoological and DNA-analysis derive from well-stratified domestic contexts with no signs of disturbances by activities of periods later than the layers in which they were included.

SECTION

DNA extraction and amplification

PARAGRAPH

DNA extractions and preparations for PCR reactions of the samples were carried out in a dedicated ancient DNA lab, at the Institute of Archaeology of Tel Aviv University, Israel.

The lab is located in a building where no other molecular work takes place.

PCRs and post-PCR work were performed at the Zoology Department of Tel Aviv University, Israel.

PARAGRAPH

DNA from both pig and cattle remains was extracted according to a method modified from Yang et al. (1998), and described in Meiri et al. (2017).

PARAGRAPH

Short fragments of the mtDNA Control Region (CR) were amplified.

For the pig samples, following Larson et al. (2007), a short fragment of mtDNA CR was amplified with ANC1F (5′-CTTTAAAACAAAAAAACCCATAAAAA-3′), and ANC1R (5′-TTAATGCACGACGTACATAGG-3′).

This 74 bp fragment is highly variable and can distinguish between European, Near Eastern and East Asian pig haplotypes.

PARAGRAPH

For the cattle, following Meiri et al. (2017), three primer pairs were used to target the nucleotide positions in the highly variable region of the mtDNA CR and define the major four haplotypes (for more details see Meiri et al., 2017).

PARAGRAPH

PCR amplifications were performed in 25 μl reactions with: 1× PCR buffer, 1.5 U of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase High Fidelity, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.2 mM of each dNTP (all Invitrogen, UK) 0.1 mg/ml Bovine Serum Albumin (New England, Bio Labs, UK)/Rabbit Serum Albumin (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) for the pigs and the cattle respectively, 0.4 μM of each primer (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) and 2–4 μl of DNA extract.

The PCR amplification consisted of an initial denaturing at 94 °C for 4 min, followed by 55 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 47–58 °C (depending on the primer pair) for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 40 s with a final extension period of 5 min at 68 °C.

PARAGRAPH

The amplicons were cleaned from unincorporated primers using Exonuclease I, and Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK).

The samples were sequenced and analyzed in ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer or Beckman-Coulter CEQT 8000 Genetic Analysis System.

Sequencing was conducted on both strands.

PARAGRAPH

Negative controls were used during DNA extractions (every sixth or seventh sample) and in all PCR reactions.

All blanks were clean.

All reagents used were molecular biology grade, and when possible, were decontaminated using UV irradiation.

All working areas and equipment were decontaminated using bleach, and/or UV irradiation.

PARAGRAPH

All ancient samples were re-extracted and between one to two fragments were amplified.

Only samples that were consistent with the results of repeated extractions and amplifications were included in the analyses.

PARAGRAPH

DNA sequences have been deposited in GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) with accession numbers: MH745979–MH745991.

SECTION

Phylogenetic analyses

PARAGRAPH

The ancient pig DNA sequence data were aligned manually with modern wild boar, domestic pigs, and ancient pig sequences available in GenBank.

Specifically, to compare haplotype frequency in the Mediterranean by period, ancient DNA sequences mainly from Mediterranean and Near East were added to the data obtained in this work (Supplementary Tables 1 & 2).

PARAGRAPH

MtDNA sequences from cattle were aligned manually with modern and ancient domestic cattle sequences available in GenBank.

PARAGRAPH

Median joining haplotype networks of 23 ancient and 196 modern Greek pig sequences and 19 ancient and 34 modern cattle sequences from Greece were obtained using Network v.5.0.0.3 (http://www.fluxus-engineering.com), using default parameters.

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

Extraction and amplification of part of the mtDNA proved possible only in the case of bones from the northernmost part of the Lower Citadel (the third group).

The success rate reached in this group was 22.7% (5 out of 22 samples) for cattle bones, and 88.9% (8 out of 9 samples) for pig bones.

These differences in DNA preservation between samples from excavations at the same site are likely to be rooted in diagenetic processes caused by different depositional environments to which the three selected groups of animal bones have been exposed.

The groups of animal bones from the two excavations in the Northern Lower Town both came from layers that yielded well-preserved walls and installations of the LH IIIC settlement, but were situated immediately beneath nowadays surface.

By contrast, the Mycenaean settlement layers in the Northern Lower Citadel were covered by almost 2 m of sediments that had accumulated in the time between the Early Iron Age and the Byzantine period.

SECTION

Pigs

PARAGRAPH

We successfully extracted and sequenced DNA from eight out of 20 ancient domestic pigs: five came from LH IIIB and three from LH IIIC contexts (Supplementary Table S1).

To our surprise, we found an unknown haplogroup in Greece, E2 ANC-Italy, which is represented by a mandible from a layer dating to the advanced sub-phase of LH IIIC (ca. 1100 BCE).

This is the first time that this haplogroup is reported outside of Italy, which makes it highly likely that its occurrence in Tiryns is connected to that part of Europe.

PARAGRAPH

In light of the considerable importance of this find, it was decided to 14C-date the mandible in order to ascertain its date and exclude the unlikely possibility of a later intrusion.

The sample was dated in the DANGOOR Research Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (D-REAMS) Laboratory of the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel.

The age of the sample (RTD 9440) was 3100 ± 38 years BP.

After calibration in OxCal v4.3.2 (https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html) using calibration curve IntCal13 (Reimer et al., 2013) the 68.2% probability was between 1420 and 1300 cal.

BCE, and 95.4% probability was between 1445 and 1260 cal.

BCE (with a median date of 1354 cal.

BCE).

Accordingly, while the mandible was found in a context dating to the time around 1100 BCE it seems to be considerably earlier and to date to the palatial period.

PARAGRAPH

Adding the data published by Meiri et al. (2017), Fig. 1 presents the different haplotypes throughout the Bronze Age of the Greek Mainland (Early Helladic [EH] until LH IIIC).

The composition of the haplogroups between EH II to LH IIIB is very similar: the European haplogroup E1 ANC-A, and the Near Eastern haplogroup Y1 dominate in both periods.

Haplogroup Y2 which Meiri et al. (2017) suggested is of European origin also appears in both periods.

In the palatial period (phases LH IIIA and IIIB), as mentioned above, we found for the first time haplogroup E2 ANC-Italy.

In the LH IIIC period, Y1 and E2 ANC-Italy haplogroups cannot be ascertained.

PARAGRAPH

The median joining haplotype network shows that the most frequent haplotype today in wild boars across Greece is the European E1-ANC-C.

This is in contrast with the Bronze Age of Mainland Greece period during which the European E1-ANC-A was the most frequent haplotype (Fig. S1).

PARAGRAPH

During the time of the Aegean Bronze Age (ca. 3100/3000–1050 BCE), the Near Eastern haplotypes spread across the Mediterranean, and can be detected in Sardinia, Sicily and Greece (Fig. 2B).

In later periods, these haplotypes disappear from the region, and the dominant haplogroup is European (Fig. 2C & D).

It should be noted that the Y1 haplotypes that appear nowadays in Greece, are from Samos, an island situated close to the coast of Asia Minor (Alexandri et al., 2012).

SECTION

Cattle

PARAGRAPH

We successfully extracted and sequenced DNA from five out of 35 ancient domestic cattle specimens sampled: four were from LH IIIB and one was from LH IIIC (Supplementary Table S1).

Two haplogroups were detected: T and T3, both are common in Europe (Troy et al., 2001).

Their composition does not change much across the period of EH II to LH IIIB (Fig. 1).

Unfortunately, due to poor DNA preservation, there are insufficient data concerning LH IIIC, thus, we cannot follow possible changes from the palatial to the post-palatial period.

PARAGRAPH

Nowadays the major four haplogroups (T, T1, T2, and T3) can be found in Greece (Fig. S1).

This is not surprising as cattle is economically one of the most important livestock and has been constantly bred.

In the Bronze Age of the Greek Mainland, we found only two haplogroups in Greece, T and T3, but haplogroup T3 was more diverse than it is today with many haplotypes subsequently going extinct (Fig. S1).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The results of our study imply that the periods under discussion were accompanied by changes in the genetic signature of pigs.

The Near Eastern haplogroup Y1 cannot be ascertained after the end of the palatial period (Fig. 1), although future research is needed to assess whether this is a result of livestock composition shift.

The palatial date of the first Italian pig haplotype outside of Italy emphasizes the increasing connectivity between southern Mainland Greece and Italy from the beginning of the palatial period (14th cent.

BCE) onwards.

The fact that the haplotype was obtained from a mandible suggests that pigs were traded alive, rather than their products (e.g., salted pig meat, ham), in which case cranial parts would be unlikely to be transported.

This new evidence considerably widens the existing general picture of close ties between Italy and the inhabitants of the palatial and post-palatial Mycenaean settlements and especially Tiryns.

Until now, it was reflected in various aspects of the material culture such as pottery (Handmade Burnished Ware, Ceramica Grigia) and a variety of metal objects (Belardelli and Bettelli, 1999; Jung and Mehofer, 2013; Kilian, 2007; Mehofer and Jung, 2017; Stockhammer, 2008, 2012).

Based on this evidence a migration of an increasing number of individuals from Southern and Central Italy to the Southern Greek mainland from the late 13th century BCE onwards – mercenaries, slaves, servants or part of larger migrant communities – has been inferred (Kilian, 2007; Stockhammer, 2008; Jung, 2009).

Future studies will have to determine the scale of the transfer of pigs with Italian descent to Tiryns during the palatial period, and whether their number increased together with the number of Italian migrants in the post-palatial period.

PARAGRAPH

Unfortunately, due to bad DNA preservation, there is insufficient data to arrive at firm conclusions regarding the potential movement of cattle during the transition between the two periods (Fig. 1).

We found that, during the early parts of the Bronze Age, the two most abundant European haplogroups T and T3 (Troy et al., 2001) existed in Tiryns.

Within these haplogroups, and despite the small sample size, we found greater diversity than is known from more modern samples, suggesting subsequent extinction (Fig. S1).

PARAGRAPH

During the Bronze Age the Near Eastern pig Y1 haplogroup appears in many regions including Greece and the southern Islands of Italy (Lega et al., 2017; Meiri et al., 2017).

European haplotypes start appearing in Turkey around the same time, and later in the southern Levant (Meiri et al., 2013; Ottoni et al., 2013) (Fig. 2).

This probably reflects pig translocations connected to various patterns of human mobility and trading activities between the times of the “Sea Peoples” (early 12th cent.

BCE) and the Phoenicians (early first millennium BCE) in the Mediterranean basin (e.g., Cifola, 1988).

Pigs were favorable livestock for marine transportation.

Piglets are relatively small with high fat reserves and an omnivorous diet, making them easy to transport alive (e.g. Harris, 1987; Hesse, 1990).

These results go together with recent ancient mtDNA study on humans, which show movement between Sardinia and the Levant in both directions, and present a picture of mobile communities (Matisoo-Smith et al., 2018).

PARAGRAPH

Nowadays the Near Eastern Y1 pig haplogroup does not exist on either the Greek Mainland, Sicily or Sardinia, and its occurrences are reported from a few museum samples from Campania and Tuscany, Italy dated to about 1800 CE (Maselli et al., 2016), and from the East Aegean island of Samos near the Turkish shore (Fig. 2D).

The issue of when this pig haplogroup may have become extinct on the Greek Mainland may only be clarified through future DNA-analyses of pigs from find contexts dating to the first millennium BCE.

The archaeozoological data from Tiryns indicate that the majority of domestic animals were slaughtered on-site (Morgenstern, 2016).

Still, the Near Eastern genetic signature is not found in the mtDNA of modern mainland-Greek wild boars, while the European lineage signature existed during the Bronze Age and can be found today in modern wild boar in the region (Alexandri et al., 2012) (Figs. 2 & S1).

In contrast, in the southern Levant, Meiri et al. (2013) reported a turnover in pig population, caused by European pigs, which were brought to the region, and then over time took over the mtDNA genetic signature completely.

The difference between the regions may result from the nature of the respective patterns of mobility (trade vs. migrations), or different local factors.

Another possible explanation can relate to European pigs, which might have some sort of advantage over Near Eastern pigs.

The same replacement happened before when early Neolithic farmers spread domestic pigs westward into Europe, nonetheless, once domesticated, European pigs rapidly replaced pigs of Near Eastern origin throughout Europe (Larson et al., 2007).

However, our results, derived only from mtDNA, which represents solely the maternal lineage, thus might not reflect the whole picture.

Further studies should determine the amount of influence these translocations had on the modern population of wild boars.

PARAGRAPH

The results of this study show that ancient DNA is a powerful tool that enables us to reveal ancient translocations, and pigs serve as good proxies for studying human mobility and trade connections.

SECTION

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

The Bronze Age in the Aegean Basin was a period of great changes.

Patterns of mobility in this period are well captured in the mtDNA of pigs.

During this time, pigs with Near Eastern signature were brought to Greece, Sardinia and Sicily, while pigs with European signature were translocated east to Anatolia and the southern Levant.

We also detected, for the first time, connections between Greece and Italy using ancient DNA of pigs.
