ABSTRACT

TITLE

New onset refractory status epilepticus due to primary angiitis of the central nervous system

PARAGRAPH

Primary Angiitis of the central nervous system is a rare and poorly understood variant of vasculitis.

We narrate a case of a 46-year-old male who presented with new onset refractory status epilepticus mimicking autoimmune encephalitis.

In this case we are reporting clues that could be useful for diagnosis and extensive literature review on the topic.
