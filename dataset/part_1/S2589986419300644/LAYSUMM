TITLE

Efficacy and tolerability of perampanel in patients with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE): A retrospective, single-center study from the United Arab Emirates (UAE)

PARAGRAPH

Genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) accounts for nearly one third of all epilepsy types and Perampanel is an approved adjunctive treatment option.

The study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of Perampanel in patients with GGE in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Of the 21 subjects enrolled, 11 achieved seizure freedom and eight showed a reduction in their seizure frequency.

Nineteen patients remained on Perampanel treatment beyond six months and seven continued with Perampanel as their only form of treatment.

Adverse events were reported in only two patients.

Perampanel should be considered as an option for patients diagnosed with GGE.
