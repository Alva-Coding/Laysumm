TITLE

Optimizing speed/accuracy trade-off for person re-identification via knowledge distillation

PARAGRAPH

Person re-identification refers to the problem of identifying a person of interest across a network of cameras.

This task is specially required by surveillance applications for security systems in public areas such as airports and train stations.

For a real-world person re-identification application, in order to guarantee a timely response, it is crucial to find the balance between accuracy and response time.

We analyse this trade-off, by comparing classical machine learning methods, with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

Additionally, we propose and analyse network distillation as a learning strategy to reduce the computational cost of deep learning architectures at test time.
