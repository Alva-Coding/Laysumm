TITLE

A point-of-interest suggestion algorithm in Multi-source geo-social networks

PARAGRAPH

Newly emerging location-based social network (LBSN) services provide us with new platforms to share interests and individual experience.

The problems of data sparsity and user distrust in LBSNs create a severe challenge for traditional recommender systems.

Moreover, users' behaviors in LBSNs show an obvious spatio-temporal pattern.

Valuable extra information from microblog-based social networks (MBSNs) can be utilized to improve the effectiveness of POI suggestion.

We propose a model to fulfill the top-$k$ suggestion based on the fused data of LBSNs and MBSNs.

Extensive experiments on two real geo-social networks show the superiority of our model.
