TITLE

Adjunctive perampanel for glioma-associated epilepsy

PARAGRAPH

Patients with gliomas, a common type of primary brain tumor, can suffer from epilepsy.

It is thought that seizures and epilepsy arises in glioma patients from the signaling via glutamate receptors.

Therefore, we sought to evaluate perampanel, a glutamate receptor antagonist.

In the single-arm study, we evaluated patients with focal-onset seizures caused by underlying glioma.

Eight subjects received perampanel and six patients experienced some benefit from perampanel therapy.

Perampanel should be considered in patients with glioma-associated epilepsy.
