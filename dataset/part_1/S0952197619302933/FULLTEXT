TITLE

Optimal capacity allocation under random passenger demands in the high-speed rail network

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

With the rapidly increasing requirement for “high-speed and high-density” railway transportation, the railway industry has to pursue the intelligence of railway transportation system.

Railway intelligent transportation system is a new generation system that is integrated by advanced intelligent technology, communication technology and information processing technology to fulfill the aims of guaranteeing safety, improving transportation efficiency, enhancing management and high service quality at lower cost (Li et al., 2003; Ning et al., 2006).

High-speed railway is a mode of transport with large capacity and high safety, which is mainly used as inter-city routes with heavy passenger transport (Wong et al., 2002).

Thus, effectively managing and operating the high-speed railways then becomes an important issue for the railway operators.

PARAGRAPH

In the daily railway operations, train timetables and capacity allocation are essential to the enhancement of profitability, level of service and competitiveness in the market for the high-speed rail network operators.

In practice, as a sub-problem of the train operating managements, train timetabling problem determines trains’ arrival and departure time at stations and yards, such that conflicts among trains will not occur and the transportation efficiency is improved.

And capacity allocation problem aims to find an optimal passenger allocation of capacity subject to constraints like maximum capacity, flow balance and so on to meet each demand.

As tactical plans of complex rail operations, trains timetables are programmed and updated every year or every season because of remarkable variation of passenger demands.

In reality, if consider the deterministic passenger demands, it would tend to use resources too tightly and may produce big variations in performance when applied in real-world operations.

In the worst situation, where demand fluctuates wildly during daily operations, the pre-specified timetable could be disturbed enough to lose its optimality.

It is obviously that if trains do not run under full load, it may cause unnecessary waste of resources.

So it is worth studying the capacity supply optimization problem under stochastic passenger fluctuation in operations.

In other words, to provide flexible train timetables based on the optimal capacity allocation to meet the fluctuation of daily passenger demands is necessary for the high-speed rail network operators.

Flexible train timetables can be implemented by autonomous decentralized train scheduling system in the integrated railway intelligent transportation system.

Details for concept of autonomous decentralized system have been described previously (Miyamoto et al., 1984; Mori et al., 1986; Ihara and Mori, 1984).

PARAGRAPH

In the real-world train timetabling problem, many factors have been considered including passenger demands, ticket prices, track capacity constraints, train capacity constraints, energy consumption, as well as maintenance and operating costs, which typically aims to construct a timetable that specifies a physical network route and detailed arrival and departure time for each train at passing stations.

In addition, passenger demands vary randomly in actual train timetabling problem.

Although determined train timetable under published timetable is easily implemented, but it may produce lower performance.

Therefore, to get a robust train timetable, not only trains and related capacity supplies have to be considered, but also stochastic fluctuations of passenger demands in daily operations should be considered.

It is of significance in practice, and has attracted tremendous attention from a variety of researchers over the past decades.

Many studies have adopted different effective methods to analysis the uncertainty of passenger demands in optimizing train timetable problem.

Under the fuzzy environment, the number of passengers getting on/off the train at each station was firstly treated as a fuzzy variable other than a crisp quantity (Yang et al., 2009).

It is a common way to treat scare data as a fuzzy variable according to the experience or expert’s evaluation.

However, compared with fuzzy variables, the method of stochastic programming is easier to deal with the influence of random parameters.

Then based on a stochastic programming with recourse framework, the robust single-track train dispatching problem under stochastic segment running times and capacity loss duration (Meng and Zhou, 2011) were studied, which incorporated different probabilistic scenarios.

They presented an example of adapting and extending known stochastic optimization frame work to meet the challenges of building realistic disruption handing tools under dynamic and uncertain data inputs.

Both of the above studies focused on the single-line railway, rather than rail network.

The research on the rail network is more necessary to accommodate the development of the modern railway.

Using the same method, a major Taiwan inter-city bus routing and timetable setting problem were studied with the stochastic variations of daily passenger demands and established a stochastic-demand timetabling model (Yan et al., 2006).

In order to improve the service quality and robustness against uncertain through minimizing the total waiting time of passengers, the robust multi-objective stochastic programming models (Hassannayebi et al., 2017) and a two-stage stochastic programming model (Shakibayifar et al., 2017) for train timetabling problem in the rail network were studied.

Besides, control strategy with simulation-based method is also used to deal with dynamic uncertain passenger demands in optimizing the train timetabling problem (Feng et al., 2017).

But too many assumptions should be considered and loses universality.

Further, the passenger arrival flow was assumed to be dependent on a discrete Markovian process to investigate robust train regulation problem (Li et al., 2016) and presented the stochastic stability condition for the train traffic subject to control constraints.

The Markovian processes are good models for many stochastic systems, including certain queuing systems, inventory systems and reliable systems.

But it is not suitable for systematic medium- and long-term forecasting.

In this paper, we not only propose a stochastic programming model to adapt the impact of random passenger demands, but also propose a strategy of optimizing timetable and train formation adjustment, which allows for quick optimization results.

PARAGRAPH

Given the inherent complexity for solving this problem, many algorithms were presented to deal with the uncertain passenger demands and realize real-time train operations.

The train routing and timetabling problem was formulated as a mixed integer programming model, and was solved using a fast heuristic algorithm based on the tabu search (Feng et al., 2018).

To solve a mixed-integer linear programming model of network design problem, a memetic algorithm (Wang et al., 2018) was developed to obtain high quality solutions.

Besides that, many meta-heuristics techniques were presented to provide useful ways of determining the initial solution, move rules, etc. (De et al., 2017a, b).

They proposed a hybrid particle swarm optimization with a basic variable neighborhood search algorithm, which has been proved to be successful is solving a variety of combinatorial problems and dealing with large size problems.

Besides that, many other superior meta-heuristics (particle optimization algorithm, genetic algorithm, etc.) are proposed to solve the problem in a large-scale realistic environment (De et al., 2019; Maiyar and Thakkar, 2018).

A particle swarm optimization-composite particle was employed to calculate ship routing and scheduling problem (De et al., 2016).

Further, a chemical reaction optimization algorithm was compared with the results with block-based genetic algorithm, genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization and performed better than others (De et al., 2018).

PARAGRAPH

To formulate a rail network capacity allocation scheme reasonably, the utilization rate of transport equipment capacity, the robustness and the efficiency of the capacity allocation process should be improved constantly on the basis of investigating the random variation of passenger flow of all lines in the rail network.

When establishing the draft timetable, operators formulate the train stop plan and determine the type and number of trains according to the passenger demands, the transportation equipment configuration conditions, physical properties (e.g., track curvature and gradient, maximum allowed speed and so on) and interaction among trains.

The draft timetable may be adjusted based on the actual operational situations.

In the past decades, there have been few studies on the capacity allocation problem based on the fluctuating passenger demands.

In order to deal a capacity allocation problem for the central headquarters that determines the capacity limits, the agent behavior and network flow models were incorporated (Demirag and Swann, 2007).

Then developed a mixed integer program and some simple heuristic algorithm to solve the problem.

By considering the formulation which maximizes the expected total profit over the possible decision under the uncertainty of demands, a heuristic algorithm for the capacity allocation problem with random demands in the rail container transportation was proposed (Cao et al., 2012).

PARAGRAPH

Despite the breakthroughs of the above studies, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there has been few research on high-speed passenger capacity allocation problem and train timetabling problem under stochastic demands.

Specifically, this study intends to provide the following contributions to the frameworks of the capacity allocation problem based on the optimization methods:

PARAGRAPH

(1) Using the theory of rail network and the train and passenger flow space–time network representation respectively, a detailed description for the structure and characteristics of train capacity allocation problem under stochastic demands in the high-speed rail network is presented.

PARAGRAPH

(2) A two-stage stochastic integer programming model is provided to meet stochastic fluctuations of passenger demands in daily operations.

The model incorporates demand uncertainty and makes no assumptions for the rail network structure and distribution of passenger demands.

Then the model is rewritten as an integer programming model when assumes that there are finite number scenarios.

PARAGRAPH

(3) Since the complexity of large-scale models make it difficult to use the integer programming solvers to search for the optimal capacity allocations within an acceptable computational time, this research especially designs an efficient heuristic algorithm based on tabu search to obtain approximate optimal solutions in a short time.

Besides, some strategies are proposed to obtain an efficient timetable and train formation adjustment based on the near-optimal capacity allocations, whose objectives are uniform departure time of trains and minimizing the total travel time of all the involved trains.

PARAGRAPH

(4) Two sets of numerical experiments, in which a five-station rail network and the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway in China are performed to illustrate the applications and to evaluate the performance of the proposed model and solution algorithm.

The results demonstrate the correctness of the proposed models.

Further, sensitivity analyses are implied to verify the practicality of the proposed methods.

PARAGRAPH

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Section 2 gives the detailed problem statements.

The train capacity allocation problem under stochastic demands in the high-speed rail network is formulated as a two-stage stochastic integer programming model in Section 3.

Then we provide a heuristic algorithm based on tabu search and strategy to obtain an efficient timetable and train formation adjustment in Section 4, followed in Section 5 by numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed model and the solution method.

Section 6 draws some conclusions and outline directions for further research.

SECTION

Problem descriptions

PARAGRAPH

Capacity allocation is one of crucial factors to indicate the efficiency of a busy railway operations.

Practically, a variety of capacity allocation based on the daily volatile passenger demands can influence train formation plan.

From the viewpoint of the railway operators, the timetables development that meet randomly variable passenger demands can be regarded as one of key factors to affect the performance of the entire transportation systems.

Thus identifying the optimal capacity allocation and driving a more reasonable timetables become significant issues faced with the railway operation managers in the practical operations.

The scope of this study is optimizing the train timetabling operations for the given passenger demands based on a pre-given timetable which can provide the trains’ maximum capacity.

So for the purpose of detailed describing the problem, we focus on the following aspects.

SECTION

Rail network representation

PARAGRAPH

Firstly, to describe high-speed rail network clearly, we consider the high-speed rail network (N,L), where N is the set of rail stations and L is the set of all arcs in the rail network.

Let A denotes the set of all arcs in the rail network including the dummy node 0 which denotes the nodes outside of the network, i.e., A=N∪0×N∪0∖︀{i,i∈N∪0×N∪0}, which means there is no connection arc between the node and itself.

The rail network considered in this paper consists of the double-track railway which has a pair of single tracks and involves running one track in each direction, compared to a single-track railway where trains in both directions share the same track.

Fig. 1 shows the double-track railway, where several stations locate along the railway and the stations are denoted consecutively with 1,2,…,n.

There are two tracks connect each pair of adjacent stations in the double-track railway in Fig. 1.

PARAGRAPH

The two direction trains will not influence each other.

So in this paper we only consider the outbound trains in train timetabling problem in the double-track high-speed rail network as shown in Fig. 2.

There are 5 station represent by rectangles, and the track segments connecting stations represent by straight line with arrow.

In order to demonstrate the flow-balance behavior of trains clearly, the dummy nodes are introduced as shown in Fig. 3.

PARAGRAPH

In Fig. 3, the dummy node 0 is represent by hollow rectangle which means the place outside of the rail network where trains enter and depart.

The long dotted curve separates dummy node 0 and actual station.

As for the passengers, each actual station would be connected to a dummy nodes since there are passengers getting on and off at each station.

We assume that there are following four train service lines in the network (they arrive the origin station from outside of the network and leave the network from the terminal station):

PARAGRAPH

In this paper, the OD (O and D denote passengers’ origin and destination respectively) pairs of passengers is pre-known based on the ticket reservation system online.

For instance, if there are four passenger travel OD pairs in the network as shown in Fig. 3, where dij=(i,j) means that passengers’ origin is station i and their destination is station j.

The possible routes for an OD pair means that each passenger has the fixed origin and destination, who may travel to the destination by different routes.

For example, a possible route: “station 1 → station 2 → station 4 → station 5” or “dummy node 0 → station 1 → station 2 → station 4 → station 5 → dummy node 0” for a passenger with OD pair d15=(1,5).

All possible routes for passenger flow with the four OD pair are described in Table 1.

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

There are 10 possible passenger OD pairs shown in Table 2 in the high-speed rail network with 5 stations as shown in Fig. 3.

In high-speed rail operations, trains will not stop at every station, and not all stations have large passenger demands.

In this paper, we ignore the OD pairs at those stations whose passenger demands are small.

PARAGRAPH

The train-flow and passenger-flow space–time network

PARAGRAPH

The space–time network is adopted to demonstrate the relationship between train-flow and passenger-flow.

The train-flow and passenger-flow in the high-speed rail network indicate that many passengers with different OD pairs arrive at their origin station from the outside of the network, and travel to their destination station where they leave the network.

In order to demonstrate clearly, a space–time network is adopted.

The network as shown in Fig. 4 indicates a trains’ movements within certain time periods and space locations.

The horizontal axis represents the time duration; the vertical axis stands for the station.

Two types of arcs are defined: service arc and holding arc.

Service arc represents a train trip from one station to another and holding arc represents the holding of trains at a station.

The four lines in Fig. 4 represent passenger demands: d35.

The origin station and the terminal station of Line 1 and Line 4 who stop at station 4 and station 3 respectively are station 1 and station 5.

And for Line 2 who would stop at station 2 and Line 3 who would stop at station 2 and station 3, the origin station and the terminal station are station 1 and station 4.

PARAGRAPH

Besides that, the right side of Fig. 4 illustrates trains stop plan corresponding to the space–time network: the red nodes represent origin and destination of trains in the network, the green nodes represent stations where trains pass and stop and the hollow nodes represent stations where the train passes without stopping.

The arc that trains passing can be seen clearly in the Fig. of trains stop plan, which provides basis for maximum capacity calculating.

PARAGRAPH

The space–time network is also applied to mobility of passengers corresponding to certain times and stations.

As shown in Fig. 5, a passenger flow space–time network represents a specific OD pair.

Such networks are designed to be symmetrical to the train flow time–space networks.

The horizontal and vertical axes are defined as the same as those in the train flow space–time network.

An arc designates an activity that shows passenger movement.

Altogether, there are three types of arcs defined: delivery arc, holding arc and demand arc.

A delivery arc represents passengers being transported from one station to another on the corresponding train.

A holding arc indicates that the passengers stay at a station to transfer.

And a demand arc connects the origin station and the terminal station of the network’s corresponding OD pair, which denotes the service demands for the OD pair that would actually be served in the network.

Mathematical formulations

PARAGRAPH

In this section we formally propose a two-stage stochastic integer programming model for capacity allocation problem under stochastic demands in the high-speed rail network by using network optimization techniques.

Before introducing the model, to facilitate problem solving, we make the following assumptions:

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

For stations which involve many service lines, passengers may held for a period to transfer from one train to another.

In this paper we assume the cost of transferring is a constant.

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

Due to the fluctuation of passenger demands in high-speed train operations, in the solution process, we consider the estimated number of passenger demands at each arc randomly based on the actual situation, instead of considering the detailed number of passengers getting on/off each train at each station.

Besides that, as stated in Section 2.1, the OD passenger demands are not existing among all nodes in the network, thus we ignore the OD pairs at those stations whose passenger demands are very small.

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

All trains in the carrier’s operation are assumed as the same size in this paper.

And only one class of ticket price is taken into account.

SECTION

The stochastic programming theory and notations introduction

PARAGRAPH

Stochastic program aims at modeling optimization problems that involve uncertainty in the parameters.

Stochastic integer programs (Birge and Louveaux, 1997) are those for which some decision variables are required to be integer or binary.

Although some exact and approximate methods have been proposed to solve specific problems, there are no general efficient methods for solving general stochastic integer programs.

PARAGRAPH

We assume that the train timetabling decision (for a planning horizon) has to be made, with only some knowledge of future scenarios (i.e., possible realizations) of parameters.

The overall objective is to determine a train scheduling plan, such that the total expected profit is maximized.

The decision is tactical in nature and needs to be decided over longer planning periods.

However, it is also used as the operational level planning tool and can be decided when more information becomes available.

In principle, the planning decision will be revised as time progresses and more information becomes available.

Therefore, to incorporate the uncertainty in parameters, these parameters can be realized as one of SC scenarios and the possible realizations probability of scenario ω is denoted by pω, as the scenario-based methods of dealing with random variables.

PARAGRAPH

Before formally stating the problem, we firstly introduce the notations of subscripts and parameters in Table 3, which are closely related to the train capacity allocation problem.

This problem intends to determine the capacity allocation based on the pre-given timetable which can provide maximum capacity, and meanwhile the operation profits can be maximized through optimizing the timetable.

In this research, decision variable xij denotes the number of passengers which can be carried by train flow through arc (i,j).

For convenience, let node 0 denote the outside of the network.

Then, x0i denotes the amount of capacity provided by trains with the origin station i and xj0 denotes the amount of capacity provided by trains with the terminal station j.

In addition, decision variable yijmω denotes the number of passengers with OD pair m which will be carried by train flow on arc (i,j) under scenarios ω.

The decision variable yijmω is used to present passenger flow with OD pair m on arc (i,j) to meet the actual passenger demands with OD pair m after it becomes known (see Table 4).

Model formulation for capacity allocation problem under random passenger demands

PARAGRAPH

In this paper we only consider the outbound train timetabling problem in the double-track high-speed railway, and the stations along the railway are indexed by 1,2,…,sN, where sN denotes the number of elements in the set N.

We assume that parameters μii, xii, yiimω, Cii and γiim are zeros for all i∈N∪{0}.

Based on the train flow and the passenger flow introduced above, the timetabling problem under stochastic demands can be formulated as the following two-stage stochastic integer programming model (M1): Minimize Z=∑ω∈SCpωξy,ω+∑(i,j)∈Auijxijsubject tosubject∑j∈N∪{0}xij−∑h∈N∪0xhi=0∀i∈N,subjectxij≤Cij∀i,j∈A,subjectxij∈Z+∀i,j∈A,where, for all ω,where,orξy,ω=min∑m∈OD[∑i,j∈Aγijmyijmω+ηm(Dmω−y0m̃mω)]subject tosubject∑j∈N∪{0}yijmω−∑h∈N∪0yhimω=0∀i∈N,m∈OD,subject∑m∈ODyijmω≤xij∀i,j∈N∗N,subjecty0m̃mω≤Dmω∀m∈OD,subjectxij,yijmω∈Z+∀i,j∈A,m∈OD, where Z+ denotes the set of nonnegative integers.

The first-stage objective function (1) denotes the minimization of the total expected cost (i.e., cost generated by the passenger flows, the train flows and penalties for underage of capacity supply), which is equivalent to profit maximization.

Constraints (2)–(4) are constraints of the first-stage program.

Specifically, constraint (2) is the train flow conservation constraint at every node in the network.

Constraint (3) denotes that all arc flows in the network are kept within their upper bounds.

Constraint (4) ensures that all train flows are non-negative integers.

In the second stage, the objective function (5) denotes the minimization of the negative ticket fares generated by passengers and the penalties for underage of capacity supply under scenario ω.

Correspondingly, constraints (6)–(9) are constraints of the second-stage program.

Constraint (6) is the passenger flow conservation constraints at all nodes under scenario ω.

Constraint (7) ensures that amount of passenger flows is kept within the arc capacity provided by train flows under scenario ω.

Constraint (8) holds that the number of delivered passengers with OD pair m is almost surely kept within the amount of demands with OD pair m under scenario ω.

Constraint (9) ensures that all train flows and passenger flows are non-negative integers.

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

The train capacity allocation problem in non-double track rail network is different from the problem considered in this paper.

For example, meet and pass constraints should be considered in the single track rail network due to the fact that trains can meet and pass only at stations and sidings.

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

Here, the capacity allocation problem is formulated as a two-stage integer programming model to represent the randomness arising from passenger demands.

Two-stage stochastic programs with recourse consist of two parts: the first part decisions (first-stage variables) have to be made under uncertainty in some parameters and the second part decisions (second-stage or recourse variables) can be made after the realization of the uncertain parameters is known.

The first-stage variables are subject to structural constraints, and represent decisions that must be made before the values of uncertain parameters are observed.

Since the first-stage decisions cannot anticipate which scenario will realize, they have to be identical for all scenarios (called non-anticipativity constraints).

Subsequently, based on these decisions, the second-stage decision variables represent recourse actions that can be taken after a realization of the uncertain parameters is observed.

Their optimal value depends both on the realization of the uncertain parameters, and on the optimal value of the first stage variables.

In the two-stage stochastic integer programming model (M1), decision variables are divided into first- and second-stage decision variables xij, and yijmω.

The first-stage constraints (2)–(3) are scenario independent.

The second-stage decision variables yijmω denote scenario-dependent recourses which are associated with a realization of the second-stage constraints (6)–(8).

PARAGRAPH

If we assume that there are finite number scenarios in the problem, then the two-stage stochastic integer program (M1) can be rewritten as the following integer programming model (Birge and Louveaux, 1997) (M2): Minimize Z=∑ω∈SCpω∑m∈OD[∑i,j∈Aγijmyijmω+ηm(Dmω−y0m̃mω)]MinimizeZ=+∑(i,j)∈Auijxijsubject tosubjectto∑j∈N∪{0}xij−∑h∈N∪0xhi=0∀i∈N,subjecttoxij≤Cij∀(i,j)∈A,subjectto∑j∈N∪{0}yijmω−∑h∈N∪0yhimω=0∀i∈N,m∈OD,ω∈SC,subjectto∑m∈ODyijmω≤xij∀i,j∈N∗N,ω∈SC,subjecttoyom̃mω≤Dmω∀m∈OD,ω∈SC,subjecttoxij,yijmω∈Z+∀i,j∈A,m∈OD,ω∈SC, where Dm is a random variable and has finite scenarios, for each m∈OD.

So the optimum of model (M2) can be regarded as an approximate optimum of model (M1).

Since there is no effective method to deal with the large-scale stochastic integer programming model (M2), even when there is several scenarios in the problem.

Before presenting an effective heuristic algorithm, we first analyze some special properties of the model (M1) below.

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

There exists a feasible solution for the stochastic integer programming model (M1).

PARAGRAPH

In fact, all decision variables may be taken zero to get a trivial feasible solution for the stochastic integer programming model (M1).

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

All feasible solutions have bounds for the stochastic integer programming model (M1).

PARAGRAPH

Because all decision variables have bounds in the stochastic integer programming model (M1), all feasible solutions of the stochastic integer programming model (M1) also have bounds.

In summary, we can infer that there must be an optimal solution of M1.

Solution methodology

SECTION

Tabu search heuristic algorithm

PARAGRAPH

As introduced above, we have to optimize capacity allocation that could best absorb stochastic demand disturbances.

For a large-scale problem, it would cost a significant amount of time to solve and may not even get the optimal solution in a reasonable computation time.

Actually, there are tens of thousands of integer decision variables in the real-world capacity allocation problem with random demands.

In order to obtain a better feasible solution than the previous one at each step, and obtain a high quality feasible solution in a reasonable calculation time, we attempt to design a meta-heuristic algorithm: tabu search heuristic algorithm (TSHA) to obtain a near-optimal solution of the mathematical model (M2).

PARAGRAPH

The tabu search algorithm was first introduced by Glover (1986).

It is a deterministic meta-heuristic on account of local search, which makes extensive use of memory for guiding the search (Corman et al., 2010).

And it can well avoid being trapped in local optimal and re-visiting the same solution.

Therefore, a heuristic algorithm based on tabu search is designed according to the characteristic of the proposed model in this paper.

To illustrate the solution process clearly, the detailed procedure of TSHA is first given in Table 5.

PARAGRAPH

The TSHA is realized by repeating search process from a feasible solution to another better one as illustrated in Fig. 6.

There are three important aspects in the process.

One is that we need determine a good quality initial feasible solution which can greatly improve the efficiency of searching.

The other is the establishment of incumbent solution neighborhood which should be done if it fails to meet iterative termination conditions.

It is crucial for a better direction of the search, which affects the quality of solution at each step.

In addition to this, the aspiration criterion is set to reinforce the local search to avoid losing an admirable state.

That is, if a solution in the tabu list is largely superior to others, then reconsider and search it as a new incumbent solution.

The other solutions are forbidden in the tabu list to avoid being trapped in local optimal or infinite loops.

To deal with the problems mentioned above in the model presented in this paper, we discuss the selection of initial solution, the setting of the neighborhood of incumbent solution and the aspiration criterion of algorithm in detail below.

PARAGRAPH

Determined of initial solution: Since most real-world optimization problems involve multiple constrains, which are not easy to find feasible solutions.

It has been proven that all decision variables may be taken zero to get a trivial feasible solution for the stochastic integer programming model M1.

So in this paper, we start from it to obtain a good quality feasible solution to be the initial solution of TSHA.

In the process of seeking the optimal capacity allocation, we use the objective function of the model M2 to measure the priority of each feasible solution.

The procedure is summarized in Table 6.

PARAGRAPH

Neighborhood structure: At each step, a neighborhood is generated base on the initial solution.

Assuming that ynow is the seed solution at the incumbent iteration, generate the neighborhood Nynow then select one element in it as the seed solution for the next iteration.

Thus the structure of the neighborhood must be determined.

In order to avoid empty neighborhood as far as possible, we generate the neighborhood which involves all the variables.

The following method is used to generate neighbors of ynow: ynow=a1,b1,…,n1,a2,b2,…,n2,…,[am,bm,…,nm]Nynow=a1′,b1′,…,n1′,a2,b2,…,n2,…,[am,bm,…,nm]a1,b1,…,n1,a2′,b2′,…,n2′,…,[am,bm,…,nm]⋮a1,b1,…,n1,a2,b2,…,n2,…,[am′,bm′,…,nm′]

PARAGRAPH

In this paper, the neighborhood Nynow contains m solutions due to there are m OD pair.

At each step, the size that needs to be added on the non-zero element is calculate by the potential passenger demands on each arc minus the incumbent solution, then divided by 2 and rounding down.

Besides, the capacity constrains the passengers’ number, so the extra passenger demands are allocated to other arc under the same OD and scenarios.

Here we take a 3-station rail network as an example as shown in Fig. 7, the capacity of arc 1-3 is 1000, and there are 1400 passengers would like to go from station 1 to station 3.

We assume the element of the initial solution under d13 and ω1 is 700,0,0,700,0,0,700, which represent on the arcs (0-1, 0-2, 1-2, 1-3, 2-3, 2-0, 3-0) respectively.

When expanding neighborhood, (1400-700)/2 = 350 needs to be add to each non-zero element.

Because of the capacity limitations on arc 1-3 (1000), there are 50 passengers have to choose another route, that is 1-2 and 2-3.

So the neighborhood is extend as: (1000,0,50,1000,50,0,1050).

PARAGRAPH

Then the objective function values are calculated and choose the optimal one and corresponding y.

Then judge whether it is the same as the solution set in the tabu list TL.

If so, choose the second-best solution, else, it is the incumbent solution in the next stop.

By cycling this step until the iterative termination condition is satisfied as illustrated in Fig. 6.

PARAGRAPH

Aspiration criterion: At each step in the TSHA considered in this paper, the optimal solution need be tabooed in the tabu list TL, and is forbidden for subsequent |TL| cycles in order to avoid being trapped in local optimal.

Besides, the aspiration criterion should be considered to obtain an optimal solution as soon as possible.

At the iteration whose frequency is integer multiple of 5, if the objective value of y is better than that of the best solution encountered so far, then this tabu move will be invalid, that is, solution y can be selected.

In addition, if all elements of the seed solution are forbidden to change, the best solution into the tabu move neighbors can be selected as a seed solution for next iteration, even if it may result in a worse solution than the current one.

Strategy of optimizing timetable and train formation adjustment

PARAGRAPH

The near-optimal capacity allocation are obtained by the proposed model and heuristic algorithm.

In this section, we propose a strategy of optimizing timetable and train formation adjustment (SOTTFA) reasonably.

At the planning stage, the pre-given timetable which provides maximum capacity can be adjusted by reducing redundant trains and adjusting the number of compartments based on the capacity allocation.

Besides that, we consider the two periods: peak hours and off-peak hours.

At peak hours, the number of trains (or the trains which need to adjust train formation) remains unchanged.

At non-peak hours, the trains’ departure times at each station keep uniform as soon as possible.

It means that uniform departure time of trains can supply capacities better and it is convenience to reduce the redundant trains (or redundant car compartment).

For example, if there are 4 trains whose departure time are 10:00, 10:15, 10:20 and 11:00 respectively, and one of them need to be reduced.

Thus we generate uniform departure interval of the remaining train, that is: 10:00, 10:30 and 11:00.

Then 3 trains are selected to calculate the variance between their departure time and the uniform timetable respectively.

Finally we get the optimal solution: the 3 trains are remained whose departure time is 10:00, 10:20 and 11:00 respectively.

It is one of the objective, which can be defined as the following function: minQ1=1Nretain∑i∈N∑t∈Tst(Ttdi−Ttui)2.

PARAGRAPH

In the Eq. (17), Ttdi represents the departure time of train t at station i, and Ttui represents the departure time of train t at station i in the uniform timetable.

PARAGRAPH

In addition to this, there is another objective particularly considered in this section.

That is, minimizing the total travel time of all the involved trains, which can be described as the following function: minQ2=∑t∈Tst(TtDt−TtOt).

PARAGRAPH

In the Eq. (18), the parameters TtDt and TtOt are the time that train t arrives at the terminal station Dt and departs from the origin station Ot respectively.

It aims to retain the trains with high speed to improve efficiency of operations.

PARAGRAPH

Apart from this, there are three compromise approaches (Xu et al., 2015) introduced including ideal-point, linearly weighted and fuzzy linear programming approach.

In this section, we adopt the linearly weighted compromise approach to deal with the two objectives stated above.

Firstly, the two objectives need to be normalized into a common scale by using the following two equations, μ¯Q1=μQ1−μQ1minμQ1max−μQ1min,μ¯Q2=μQ2−μQ2minμQ2max−μQ2minwhere μ¯Q1 and μ¯Q2 are the normalized values of Q1 and Q2 respectively. μQ1min

and μQ2min, μQ1max and μQ2max are minimum and maximum values of Q1 and Q2 respectively.

Through effectively handled through linear weighted method, the objective is: minQ=β1μ¯Q1+β2μ¯Q2

PARAGRAPH

In the Eq. (20), βi(i=1,2) are the weight nonnegative coefficients with 0≤βi≤1(i=1,2), and meet the equation requirement: β1+β2=1, which denote the importance weights of those two objectives.

By considering the objective, we set the strategy to optimize timetable or adjust train formation.

The detailed SOTTFA is described in Table 7.

Numerical experiments

PARAGRAPH

In this section, two experiments are implemented to show the performance of the proposed model and algorithms.

Specifically, the small case is implemented to demonstrate their applications and performances.

While the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway is applied to illustrate the performance of proposed model and the algorithm when applies to a real-world train timetabling problem under stochastic demands.

To understand the influence of the stochastic demand disturbances on the solution, we also performed sensitivity analyses on the mean of the passenger demands.

The algorithm has been coded in PYTHON 2.7.14 and run under Microsoft Windows 10 platform with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU and 8G RAM.

SECTION

A small-scale case study

PARAGRAPH

We firstly suppose a small-scale high-speed rail network with five nodes and nine arcs as shown in Fig. 3.

There are four service lines in the network and a total number of 12 trains are operated in the rail network.

In addition, there are four passenger travel OD pairs in the network, i.e., d15=(1,5), d14=(1,4), d25=(2,5), d35=(3,5).

The time period we considered is from 7:05 to 12:27, and the draft train timetable under maximal supply of capacity is listed in Table 8.

Based on that, three scenarios are considered.

Under such circumstances, there are 182 variables and 107 constraints.

Since underage of capacity supply means that there are passengers who do not get on the train.

We set the penalty coefficient of capacity supply underage is a sufficiently large number ηm=1000.

The relevant experimental data of railway network: the distance of stations in Table 9.

We may also obtain the other parameters: γijm and μij from real-world data and they are presented in Table 10.

PARAGRAPH

In the real-world train timetabling problem, many factors have been considered.

If all trains served for the four lines in the peak passenger flow period are the coupled 16-car train with 1114 seats, then the upper bound of each arc (i,j) capacity in the high-speed rail network can be obtained from the timetable under maximal supply of capacity as in Table 8, and the matrix of parameters Cij in the time period from 7:05 to 12:27 can be calculated from it.

For example, there are 3 trains pass through the link 2 between station 2 and station 4 in the time period from 7:05 to 12:27, so C24=3×1114=3342.

PARAGRAPH

As stated above, passenger demands vary randomly in real-world train timetabling problem.

To get a better train timetable, not only the trains and related capacity supplies have to be considered, but also stochastic fluctuations of passenger demands in daily operations should be taken into account.

We assume that Dm are random variables with mean: EDm=(1725,1300,1600,1440), in the time period from 7:05 to 12:27.

Then we can get an approximate optimal values of xij in model (M1) by solving model (M2) as shown in Table 11.

PARAGRAPH

The number of retained trains are calculated by the capacity allocation on each arc between two stations.

After being calculated by SOTTFA, a near optimal timetable for the problem is given as shown in Table 12 based on the approximate optimal link capacity allocations obtained by solving model (M2) and the strategy proposed in Chapter 3.

It is worth mentioning that the exact solution is calculated by commercial software Cplex and is compared to the results solved by the proposed algorithm.

The capacity allocation results and the optimized timetable of them are the same under the determined passenger demands.

SECTION

Large-scale case experiment

PARAGRAPH

In this section, we provide a large-scale real-world experiment to illustrate the performance of proposed formulation and the solution algorithm.

The real-world train timetabling problems are quite complex and all aspects of the problems cannot be considered in a paper.

So some parameters such as Cij, μij and γijm etc. are based on data from the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway in China.

The passenger demands in large-scale station are relatively large while in small-scale station is relatively small.

Thus the parameters Dm are randomly generated based on the situation in real-world.

PARAGRAPH

The Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway, connecting two major cities, Beijing and Shanghai, with length of 1318 km and 23 intermediate stations (see Fig. 8), which was opened on June 30, 2011.

The railway operates with high speed trains which have the top speed of 350 km per hour in commercial service.

And in this paper, according to the high-speed railway ticket fare setting in China, we consider the fare is CN¥0.46 per km without considering the fares of different seats.

PARAGRAPH

In the real-world train operation, trains will not stop at every station in high-speed rail operations, and not all stations have large passenger demands.

So we ignore the OD pairs at those stations whose passenger demands are small.

There are 71 passing trains and the origin station, terminal station and passing station are listed in Fig. 9 (the red nodes represent origin and destination of trains in the network, the green nodes represent stations where trains pass and stop and the hollow nodes represent stations where the train passes without stopping).

The timetable is correspondingly listed at the end of the paper (Appendix) (The name of stations are abbreviated).

As shown in Fig. 9, there are 18 pairs train service lines in the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway.

For example, Line G175: Beijing South → Cangzhou West → Dezhou East → Jinan West.

All trains served for the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway may be the coupled 16-car train with 1114 seats.

The upper bound of each arc (i,j) capacity Cij in the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway can be obtained from the timetable for holiday period published on June 6, 2018.

The other parameters γijm, ηm and μij may be obtained from real-world data, which are listed in Table 13.

PARAGRAPH

It is worth noting that the origin and destination of the trains shown in Fig. 9 are not the real origin and destination station.

For example, the origin and destination of Line G175 are Beijing South and Jinan West respectively on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway.

But its real origin and destination are Beijing South and Qingdao respectively.

In this case, trains cannot provide the all capacity since there are passenger demands on other railways rather than the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway.

Thus we set capacity impact factor αt.

Then capacity that train can provide is: αtWt.

We discuss the different situations as follows:

PARAGRAPH

(1) If the trains only travel on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway station, i.e. both the origin and destination station are on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway station, we set αt=1.

PARAGRAPH

(2) For the trains whose origin or destination station is not on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway station: the value of αt depends on the proportion that the number of stations which trains stop on the Beijing-Shanghai railway in the trains’ travel lines.

Taking Line G175 as an example: there are 8 stations that train would stop from Beijing to Qingdao, and 4 stations on the Beijing-Shanghai railway line, thus the factor αt=0.5.

PARAGRAPH

In this example, we choose 14 stations where more than 13 trains stop at in the period from 6:00 to 12:00.

The number of all possible passenger trip OD pairs in the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway is 91, and Dm is randomly generated and their mean values are listed in Table 14.

It should be noted that the number of decision variables increases fast when the number of nodes in the network increases, e.g., the number of decision variables is more than twenty thousand for the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway.

We may obtain an approximate optimal capacity allocation as shown in Tables 15–16 and Fig. 10 for the problem by solving model M2 after getting the data of random passenger demands and the pre-given timetable.

Tables 15 and 16 list the capacity allocation that passengers enter and depart from the network respectively.

The name of stations are abbreviated in turn of Beijing South, Tianjin South, Dezhou East, Jinan West, Taian, Qufu East, Zaozhuang, Xuzhou East, Suzhou East, Bengbu South, Nanjing South, Wuxi East, Suzhou North and Shanghai Hongqiao.

In Fig. 10, the capacity allocation assignment between every two high-speed railway stations.

Lines of different weights and depth of color represent different numbers of capacity allocation, which are listed on the left side.

PARAGRAPH

Fig. 11 shows the comparison of passenger allocation and maximum capacity of trains.

Since the timetable as shown in Appendix is set to provide the maximum capacity, it is adjustable slightly and the train formation also can be adjusted.

The passenger allocations from Jinan West to Xuzhou East are almost equal to trains’ capacity, so the corresponding trains need not be adjusted as shown in Fig. 11.

Besides that, the timetable and train formation who travel from Beijing South to Jinan West and from Wuxi East to Shanghai Hongqiao should be adjust.

Due to the situation that there are unknown passenger demands outside of the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway, we adjust the train formation instead of reducing the redundant trains.

So from the stop plan, the capacity of trains and the near optimal passenger allocation, we adopt SOTTFA to calculate.

Then the result is that the coupled 16-car trains which involve Line G175, Line G471, Line G177, Line G179, Line G27, Line G181, Line G473 and Line G183, whose origin and destination station are Beijing South and Jinan West respective, and Line G7597, Line G1735, Line G7575, Line G7131, Line G7127, Line G7571, Line G7135, Line G7563, Line G7195 and Line G7139, who travel from Nanjing South to Shanghai Hongqiao on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway that can be adjusted and those trains are marked in the timetable of Appendix.

In fact, there are many trains passing from Beijing to Jinan and from Nanjing to Shanghai due to the relatively large passenger demands, but not all trains passing through the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway.

At the same time, the passenger demands considered in this paper are those on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway.

Thus extra capacity can provide for the arc from Beijing to Jinan and from Nanjing to Shanghai whose passenger demands are large.

SECTION

Mean passenger demand sensitivity analyses

PARAGRAPH

The sensitivity analyses are performed on the mean of the passenger demand, which is analyzed to test the influence for the timetable adjustment if the passenger demand increases or decreases.

The passenger demand should not change too much for suit the real-world situation.

Thus in this paper, we tested two more situations, 80% and 120% of the original mean based on the small-scale case as stated in Section 5.1.

PARAGRAPH

For the simplicity of implementing numerical experiments in this section, the parameters Dm are randomly generated with mean:EDm=(1725,1300,1600,1440), which is realized by generating random numbers between 0.8 and 1.2 and multiplying with the mean respectively.

Fig. 12 shows the different passenger demand with 80%, 100% and 120% of the original mean under 3 different scenarios.

We would like to test the effect of different mean passenger demand on timetable optimization.

The near optimal passenger allocations are obtained by TSHA which can be seen Table 17.

The result comparison of the three cases is shown in Fig. 13 clearly.

PARAGRAPH

After being calculated by SOTTFA, we get the near optimaltimetable respectively.

The timetable comparison of the three situations is presented in Table 18.

Comparing to the optimized timetable Table 12 under the original mean, the situation that 80% of the original mean can reduce a train on Line 1 whose departure time is 7:50.

In addition to this, the number and departure time of the other trains in Table 12 are not change.

For the other situation that 120% of the original mean of passenger demand, a train on Line 2 whose departure time is 8:05 should be adding.

Besides that, the passenger allocations on Line 1 and Line 4 are saturated, which can be studied to add additional trains that not limited by the pre-given plan timetable.

PARAGRAPH

From the above analysis, we can know that for the low passenger demand, we can obtain low passenger allocations relatively and reasonable timetable after reducing redundant trains, at the same time adjusting the train formation from coupled 16-car to 8-car trains.

For the high passenger demand, a higher passenger allocations are obtained to optimize timetable.

And many trains can run under fully loaded.

The result shows that the proposed model and the solution algorithm can optimize the train timetabling operations based on a given passenger demand and it is consistent with the real-world situation.

SECTION

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

In this paper, we propose a stochastic integer programming model for passenger capacity problem under random passenger demands and some strategies for optimizing train timetabling problem in the high-speed rail network by using network optimization techniques.

Then rewrite it as an integer programming model when assumes that there are finite number scenarios.

The model incorporates demand uncertainty and makes no assumptions for the rail network structure and distribution of passenger demands.

And it needs data from train service planning and online scheduling system to provide available transport capacities as well as all associated prices and costs.

Historical data is gathered and maintained over time to permit forecasting the variation of passenger demands.

In addition, we provide a tabu-based algorithm and strategies in order to obtain approximate optimal solutions and near-optimal timetable for the problem in a short time.

PARAGRAPH

There are two possibilities for future research.

One can consider the high speed train timetabling problem under stochastic demands and several different classes of ticket prices.

In this research, we assume that only one class of ticket price in the problem, but it is not reasonable.

Another future research topic is the more detailed timetable optimization problem, which needs to optimize train stop plan, dwelling time at station etc. to obtain more optimal timetables, rather than by reducing or increasing the number of trains.
