TITLE

Autosomal dominant temporal lobe epilepsy associated with heterozygous reelin mutation: 3 T brain MRI study with advanced neuroimaging methods

PARAGRAPH

Advanced neuroimaging techniques are increasingly being implemented in clinical practice.

Here we present a case report of an 18-year-old patient with autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy caused by heterozygous mutation in RELN gene.

3T MRI brain scan and advanced neuroimaging methods were used in the standard protocols to analyse voxel-based MRI, cortical thickness, and functional connectivity.

The functional connectivity analysis revealed higher local synchrony in the left temporal, left frontal, and left parietal regions and the cingulate.

Evidence of multiple areas of functional connectivity confirm the theory of epileptogenic networks in ADTLE.

Connectivity abnormalities have potential for clinical relevance and correlation.
