TITLE

Settlement patterns during the Magdalenian in the south-eastern Pyrenees, Iberian Peninsula. A territorial study based on GIS

PARAGRAPH

During the Magdalenian, the hunter-gatherers established their settlements in the south-eastern Pyrenees (Iberian Peninsula).

The region is characterized by rocky landscapes, mountain reliefs and river courses, which have shaped the reliefs.

During the Upper Pleistocene, montane pines were the main tree cover, an essential wood resource for use as fuel.

To evaluate the settlement patterns of archaeological sites set according to their chrono-cultural phase, we have studied, for first time, the territory around the sites through the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis.

The quantitative analysis of territorial variables suggests common diachronic changes in the territorial characteristics for each chrono-cultural phase.
