TITLE

Isotopic evidence of diet variation at the transition between classical and post-classical times in Central Italy

PARAGRAPH

This paper presents new carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of human and animal samples from two historical sites in central Italy to determine diet variation at the transition from classical (1st- 3rd century AD) to post-classical (6th â€“ 8th century AD) time.

Results obtained showed limited differences between the sites, although the distribution of data reveal a larger dispersion for the Roman set as opposed to the Longobard one.

This is interpreted as a result of the mixed composition of the Roman population and might be indicative of a progressive impoverishment in the diet, mostly reliant on grains, during post-classical times.
