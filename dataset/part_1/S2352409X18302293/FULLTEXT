TITLE

Isotopic evidence of diet variation at the transition between classical and post-classical times in Central Italy

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

There are no isotopic works in Europe focusing on the transition from classical to post-classical times.

While most isotopic studies concentrate either on the first period (Chenery et al. 2010; Fuller et al. 2006; Prowse et al. 2005; Prowse et al. 2004) or the latter (Bourbou et al. 2011; Hakenbeck et al. 2010; Müldner and Richards 2005; Reitsema et al. 2010; Richards et al. 2006) a diachronic perspective is still lacking.

However, the transition to the post-classical times is one of important changes, which involved a shift in social and economic aspects of everyday life for most populations in the western world.

Health status and life conditions changed dramatically and human groups faced periods of instability that, among other aspects, are also testified in population replacement (Amorim et al. 2018).

In Italy, in particular, with the fall of the Western Roman Empire (476 CE), the Gothic war and the following Byzantine domination, the contribution of Longobard migration to the Peninsula had a profound impact on the cultural as well as genetic background of the Italian people (Melucco Vaccaro, 1988; Rotili 2010).

PARAGRAPH

Paleobiological data obtained earlier from two skeletal series in the area or Rome (Manzi et al. 1995; Salvadei et al. 1995; Sperduti et al. 1995), prove a clear discontinuity in health status at the transition to the post-classical world.

In this perspective a paleodietary investigation, through stable carbon and nitrogen analysis of human bone collagen of the same series, might contribute to understanding the social and economic implication that such a transition entailed.

PARAGRAPH

While this study stems from an earlier project, undertaken during the 1990s (Manzi et al. 1995; Passarello et al. 1993; Salvadei et al. 1995; Sperduti et al. 1995) on archaeological and anthropological evidence of the Longobard occupation in Italy at the end of the Roman Empire, a new season of investigations of Longobard communities in Italy by our group is currently in progress (cf. Micarelli et al. 2018).

PARAGRAPH

This paper aims to identify possible changes in human diet using stable carbon and nitrogen analysis of bone collagen.

The populations buried at the two sites, should in fact reflect very different paleodietary stories.

Lucus Feroniae, despite being a rural town on the outskirts of Rome was still part of its rich Province between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD.

According to various scholars (Garnsey 1989; Gazzetti 1985) the population here was extremely heterogeneous, characterized by slaves, freedmen and veterans.

Such heterogeneity might have resulted in a variety of diets practiced at the site, either in relation to access to foods or to the diverse origins and social background of the individuals considered.

Furthermore, a selection of resources could have either been produced locally or imported via the many ports that served Rome at the time.

Selvicciola, on the other hand, is the cemetery of a Longobard tribe, an allochthonous group occupying a declining territory at the end of the 6th century AD (Incitti 1997), with its own social and economic habitus; if some intermixing with the locals might have occurred, this was during a period of severe decline in Italy, where local populations were exiting the long phase of the Gothic War and undergoing a period of general impoverishment and crisis (Christie 1998; Giostra 2011).

PARAGRAPH

Previous paleobiological studies have shown differences between the two sites, mainly in terms of dental health (Manzi et al. 1999; Salvadei et al. 1995).

The high frequency of oral pathologies such as caries and enamel hypoplasia at Selvicciola was explained through a substantial poverty in the diet of this population, mainly based on the consumption of large quantities of grains and a limited contribution of proteins coming from meat and animal by-products.

Better oral conditions at Lucus Feroniae might have resulted from a more varied diet with a greater contribution of proteins from meat or fish.

Such a hypothesis was in line with other studies on the dietary practices of Longobard populations and their differences with the Roman diet (Bedini et al. 1997; Belcastro et al. 2007).

SECTION

Evidence of dietary practices at Roman times and later phases

PARAGRAPH

It is a common assumption that Roman diet was based on a ‘triad’ of foodstuffs: grains (wheat and barley predominately), vines and olives (Foxhall and Forbes 1982; Garnsey 1999; Potter and Mattingly 1999).

Legumes were no less important to the diet, while meat seems to have contributed to a lesser extent to the daily intake, with pigs being the main source of animal proteins and sheep and/or goat only occasionally part of the meal.

Fish seemed to have been occasionally consumed, with the use of garum, a typical fish sauce, frequently reported (Garnsey 1999).

Roman diet cannot be fully understood if divorced from a social perspective; what was served on the table of upper class families – that consumed a larger variety of foodstuffs, such as meat, fruit and vegetables, and spices – might have been very different from what was regularly consumed by the plebes – who were probably mostly relying on the grain dole – freedman or slaves.

As an example, millet, a crop rarely reported in the daily diet of upper classes is described by Columella in De Re Rustica as a rich source of protein, ideal for slaves or workers.

Regardless of the status, food in Roman times was likely to be unequally distributed between men and women.

Men were considered to be the productive part of society, either for kinship or role, hence they were allocated larger or better portion of foods, while women's diet was strictly regulated (Fuller et al. 2006; Garnsey 1999).

PARAGRAPH

Evidence of the diet of Longobard populations is less extensive.

Meat was hardly part of everyday diet although by-products, particularly dairy products, were largely consumed as reported by Paulus Diaconus in his Historia Longobardorum.

The transformations of part of the Italian territory, together with measures of security, redesigned the urban and rural orders (La Rocca Hudson and Hudson, 1987).

The population intensified in the hilly areas and in narrow lowland strips; the diffused settlement pattern of Roman Italy was gradually replaced by fixed settlements that, being related to cultivated zones, led to localized high population densities, thus exposing people to the risks of famine and to the spread of illnesses (Del Panta et al. 1985).

A number of skeletal studies, mostly focused in northern Italy, reveal a transition from a strong consumption of meat and animal proteins in the earlier phases of the Longobard occupation to a diet progressively more reliant on grains (Ahumada, 2010; Bedini et al. 1997; Mallegni et al. 1998).

Further, it is possible that the precariousness of the alimentary regimens, i.e., phenomena of “marginalization” in the production of food and of progressive degeneration of health conditions (Ginatempo 1987; Montanari 1981), maintained mortality in a high level and life expectancy low.

PARAGRAPH

Despite historical sources, our understanding of food consumption at Roman and post-classical times has seldom been questioned directly through the observation of the archaeological record.

One way to do this is through the examination of the dietary practices of these populations via stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of bone collagen.

Isotope content in the bone is able to determine the protein contribution to human and animal diet over the period in which bone tissues forms, ca.

the last 7–10 years prior to death (Ambrose and Norr 1993; Hedges et al. 2007).

Carbon isotope values (δ13C) are able to distinguish between marine (13C enriched) and terrestrial diet (13C depleted); within the latter, they can reveal if the type of plant consumed follows a C4 photosynthetic pathway (13C enriched) as opposed to a C3 one (13C depleted).

Nitrogen isotopic values (δ15N) can instead reveal the consumption of certain foodstuffs (particularly meat) as they increase by 3–5‰ according to the trophic level (Hedges and Reynard 2007; Minagawa and Wada 1984; Schoeninger and DeNiro 1984); for the same principle they can reflect consumption of marine and freshwater fish which have high values in the trophic level (Schoeninger et al. 1983).

What must be taken into consideration is the tight relation between isotopic composition of food resources, that is linked to the ecosystem, and their eaters, which is not always easily assessed archaeologically (Goude and Fontugne 2016; Hedges and Reynard 2007).

PARAGRAPH

So far only few Roman or post-classical contexts in Italy have been analyzed isotopically for paleodiet (Craig et al. 2009; Iacumin et al. 2014; Killgrove and Tykot 2013; Prowse et al. 2005; Prowse et al. 2004); our study represents a contribution to the new isotopic scenario unveiled.

Archaeological background

SECTION

Lucus Feroniae (LFR)

PARAGRAPH

The cemetery of the Via Capenate, is linked to the rural center of Lucus Feroniae, about 30 km northeast of Rome (Fig. 1).

The town was an ancient commercial and religious center.

Excavations undertaken during the 1980s (Gazzetti 1986) unearthed nearly 200 single burials of the type called a fossa with a skeletal sample of 166 individuals.

Funerary practices and the virtually systematic absence of grave goods led the archaeologist to suggest that the necropolis was assigned to manual laborers of humble origins (slaves, freedmen, war veterans etc.), that lived in the nearby town.

No radiocarbon dates are available for the site and chronological attribution was based on archaeological material.

Extensive anthropological investigations undertaken between the 1980s and the 1990s (Manzi and Argenti 1988; Manzi et al. 1989; Manzi et al. 1997) seemed to confirm such a hypothesis through the elevated presence of skeletal markers of metabolic stress.

SECTION

Selvicciola (SLV)

PARAGRAPH

The cemetery of La Selvicciola, located near the town of Ischia di Castro in the province of Viterbo, northern Latium (Fig. 1), was excavated during the 1980s (Gazzetti 1985; Gazzetti 1986).

Over a hundred burials were unearthed, with 110 individuals available for detailed anthropological analysis (Manzi et al. 1995; Salvadei et al. 1995; Sperduti et al. 1995).

The tombs were carved in local stone and grave goods suggested a Longobard origin of the burials, which often contained >2 or 3 individuals.

As for LFR, no radiocarbon dates are available for the sites, with chronological attribution based on grave goods for most of the tombs.

The skeletal sample showed reduced body and dental measurements (i.e., stature and dental area), with the former interpreted as a response to severe nutritional condition and low protein-calorie intake (Salvadei et al. 1995; Sperduti et al. 1995).

SECTION

Materials and methods

PARAGRAPH

For the humans, bone samples (approx. 2–5 g) were collected from the rib, while for the animals equal quantities were samples from the shaft of long bones.

A total of 66 human (33 from LFR and 33 from SLV) and 5 faunal (2 from LFR and 3 from SLV) specimens were collected.

Adults of both sexes and individuals of various age classes (only weaned individuals, i.e. older that 3–4 years) were selected for analysis in order to test for intra- and inter-site dietary differences.

PARAGRAPH

Sex estimates were performed according to Acsàdi and Nemeskèri (1970) integrated with Ferembach et al. (1979).

Age for adults was determined through dental wear following Lovejoy (1985) and cranial suture closure according to Meindl and Lovejoy (1985).

For subadults, the estimation of age at death was performed through the observation of dental development and eruption according to Ubelaker (1989).

PARAGRAPH

The nature of the contexts (both necropolises) explains the limited number of animal species available for sampling; isotopic data from faunal specimens from Roman sites of Isola Sacra, Rome (Prowse et al. 2004), Velia (Craig et al. 2009), the area of Verona (Laffranchi et al. 2016), Paestum (Ricci et al. 2016) and the Longobard sites in Friuli (Iacumin et al. 2014) were used to define the isotopic baseline of the foodstuffs for the archaeological sites and to reconstruct the dietary patterns of the associated humans.

PARAGRAPH

Collagen extraction followed a modified Longin method (Longin 1971).

Cortical bone (0.3 g) was cleaned by air abrasion and demineralised in 0.5 M HCl at 4 °C for several days.

The samples were then rinsed to neutral pH and gelatinised in pH 3 HCl at 70 °C for 48 h. Insoluble residues were filtered off with Ezee filters 5-8 μm.

Samples were then frozen and freeze dried for 48 h. Each of the collagen extracts were weighed (ca. 1 mg) in duplicate into tin capsules and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios were calculated using a Roboprep connected to a Europa 20–20 mass spectrometer at the Department of Archaeological Sciences, University of Bradford (UK).

Analytical error was + or −0.2‰ (per mil) or better.

The collagen yield, the percentage of carbon and nitrogen, and the atomic C:N ratio of each sample were also recorded to check collagen quality (Ambrose 1990; DeNiro 1985; van Klinken 1999).

The stable isotope data are presented in the δ-notation.

Statistical tests were performed using SPSS ver.

24.

Results and discussion

SECTION

Collagen preservation

PARAGRAPH

The atomic C:N ratio reveals a good degree of collagen preservation (Table 1) with values for all of the humans and animals in the expected range of 2.9–3.6 (DeNiro 1985; van Klinken 1999).

Collagen yields were extremely variable for humans (2.6–15%) and, to a less extent, animals (2–8%).

Within the 71 samples selected, 3 samples (2 humans from SLV and 1 human from LFR) did not meet the preservation criteria and were therefore excluded from the analysis.

Elemental composition and C:N ratios are similar at both sites (LFR: %C = mean 38.5 ± 2.2: %N = mean 13.8 ± 0.9: C:N = mean 3.3 ± 0.0 and SLV: %C = mean 40.7 ± 3.1: %N = mean14.8 ± 1.2; C:N = mean 3.2 ± 0.0).

However, there is a difference between collagen yields at the two sites (t-test, p = 0.00).

The percentage of collagen extracted from the SLV samples is on average higher (mean 8.7 ± 2.7%) than the one of LFR (mean 5.2 ± 2.1%), probably as a result of different diagenetic disturbances at the two sites.

This does not affect the overall quality of the collagen extracted; hence stable isotope data can be analyzed at an inter-site level without considering the state of preservation as influencing isotopic variation.

SECTION

Isotopic data for the faunal remains

PARAGRAPH

For the animals, the δ13C data range between −20.7‰ and −20.8‰ at LFR and −20.5‰ and −21.2‰ at SLV.

Nitrogen values range respectively between 4.1‰ and 4.7‰ and 4‰ and 4.7‰ (Table 1).

Considering limited variations between the sites, we could argue that the environment in which the animals of both site fed was isotopically similar.

The δ13C values of all of the faunal remains are consistent with a predominantly terrestrial C3 plant diet.

The nitrogen values obtained from the four pig samples (2 from each site) are unexpected for omnivores, and cluster with the only herbivore (cow) examined.

This might suggest that pigs were raised on a grazing diet similarly to what is argued for the Roman sites of Isola Sacra (Prowse et al. 2004) and Velia (Craig et al. 2009).

SECTION

Isotopic data for the humans

PARAGRAPH

Human stable isotope values from LFR range between −20.5‰ and −17.9‰ (mean − 19.6‰ ± 0.5, n = 32) for carbon and 6.7‰ and 12.1‰ (mean 10.0‰ ± 1.3) for nitrogen.

At SLV, stable isotope values range between −20.0‰ and −18.6‰ (mean − 19.4‰ ± 0.3, n = 31) for carbon and 7.6‰ and 10.4‰ (mean 9.1‰ ± 0.7).

The average isotopic difference between faunal and human remains is 1.1‰ for carbon and 5.6‰ for nitrogen at LFR and 1.5‰ for carbon and 5.1‰ for nitrogen at SLV.

The overall pattern of isotopic data from the two sites reflects a C3 terrestrial environment: with the consumption of plants and meat with different proportions according to the individuals (Hedges and Reynard 2007), and the possible consumption of marine products for some of the individuals (Schoeninger et al. 1983).

According to the relative increase in the nitrogen isotopic values of humans as compared to animals, one could argue that at both sites the consumption of animal proteins was quite significant.

PARAGRAPH

The most interesting evidence in examining the data at the two sites is given by the difference in the dispersion of the isotopic signatures (Fig. 2).

The range of δ13C values for the humans is 2.6‰ for LFR and 1.4‰ for SLV, while for δ15N it is 5.4‰ for LFR and 2.8‰ for SLV.

Both carbon and nitrogen values at Lucus Feroniae have a wider range, which suggests that a variety of foods contributed to the protein component of the diet of the individuals examined inasmuch different food habits were likely to take place at the site.

At La Selvicciola carbon and nitrogen values are tightly clustered to give a homogeneous pattern, so as to suggest that the humans were getting their proteins from a relatively restricted source.

PARAGRAPH

The difference in the isotopic distribution between the two sites considered could be explained by a consumption of a wider range of resources by the Romans as opposed to the Longobards.

Moreover, despite being located inland, it is possible that some of the Romans from LFR, coming from different social origin had the opportunity to consume more 13‑carbon and 15‑nitrogen enriched resources such as marine foods and/or anadromous fish.

As a general note, despite our understanding of the social composition of the LFR group (Gazzetti 1986), the isotopic data could also be evidence of a differential access to food resources for a number of individuals at the site, as if revealing unexpected social inequality within this community.

PARAGRAPH

Further, it is interesting to compare the human to animal offset in the nitrogen data, as this seems to suggest that the protein from the animals analyzed did not contribute much to the diet of the humans, considering that the latter are more than one trophic level above them.

Hence, we should argue that the human protein intake was likely to derive from other sources, which is striking, especially considering the importance that pork had in the Roman diet (Garnsey 1999).

This in general appears to be true also when analyzing animal data from other coeval sites, with Isola Sacra showing to be the only site where the off-set between animals (in particular pork) and humans corresponds to about one trophic level (Fig. 3).

In fact, the comparison with other Roman and Longobard sites in the area (Fig. 3) indicates that LFR presents a variability of protein intake in agreement with what is known from the Roman period (Δ15N from 4.4 to 7.7‰) (Prowse et al. 2004; Craig et al. 2009).

The slightly larger dispersion of carbon isotope ratios for LFR compared to the other Roman sites (Δ13C from 1.1 to 1.9‰), could be related to the social position and/or origin and mobility of the people constituting this group, which included veterans and slaves.

This might result in an overall heterogeneity of the type of grains that constituted the baseline diet of these people, which would in fact translate in a large range of carbon data.

PARAGRAPH

With several Roman series available for comparison, but only one published isotopic work on Longobard populations in Italy so far (Iacumin et al. 2014), our ability to compare the data obtained at LFR and SLV with other coeval series is limited.

It is however interesting to attempt a comparison with a perspective on the transition from one phase to the other.

We do so it is striking to note a general reduced variability in the dispersion of δ15N values for the Longobards when compared to the Roman series from the same geographic area (Fig. 4).

This again speaks in favor of a less varied composition of the protein portion of the diet for the Longobards, possibly as a result of a reduced contribution of either 15‑nitrogen enriched (i.e., marine meat) or 15‑nitrogen depleted (i.e., pulses) foods.

Carbon values seems to be consistent across phases (Fig. 4), with the only exception or the Longobard sites in Friuli, for which C4 crop consumption has been suggested (Iacumin et al. 2014).

Intra-site variation

SECTION

Differences according to sex and age at death

PARAGRAPH

Several non-parametric tests have been performed to detect possible differences in isotopic values at the intra- and inter-site level, primarily in accordance with sex and age at death of the individuals.

Differences according to archaeological evidence, such as grave goods composition (burial with vs. without grave goods) or burial structure/position, could not be tested because of the extremely homogeneous composition of the graves at both sites.

PARAGRAPH

No significant difference is recorded at LFR and SLV for either carbon or nitrogen values in accordance to sex (Fig. 2, Table 2).

However, when grouping adults according to age ranges (<30 = young; 30–50 = mature; >50 years old = senile), a significant difference in δ13C values emerges at SLV, specifically between young and senile individuals and again between mature and senile individuals (U-Mann Whitney test p < 0.05 for both).

Senile adults have in fact higher δ13C values (mean − 19.1‰ ± 0.3, n = 6) compared to young (mean − 19.4‰ ± 0.2, n = 9) and mature ones (−19.5‰ ± 0.2, n = 11).

When the same analysis is performed adding sex as a variable, the difference is significant (U-Mann Whitney test p < 0.05) only within male mature (−19.5‰ ± 0.3, n = 7) and old (−19.1‰ ± 0.4, n = 4) individuals.

Although statistically significant such differences should be interpreted with caution; overall a difference below 1‰ should not be considered biologically meaningful, hence such result might be linked to the extremely homogenous distribution of data for this sample.

With no known sex-related differences in the carbon isotopic signature of adults we could however consider this variance as culturally driven, likely to be associated with a greater consumption of 13‑carbon enriched foodstuffs (e.g. marine fish, C4 grains) by older members of the population.

SECTION

Differences according to health status

PARAGRAPH

According to the relative increase in the nitrogen isotopic values of humans as compared to animals we suggest a fair consumption of animal proteins at both sites (Fig. 2).

This is somehow in contrast with what proposed by Manzi et al. (1999), on the basis of oral health.

The high frequency/incidence of carious lesions and enamel hypoplasia was in fact associated by Manzi et al. (1999) with a high consumption of grains and relatively low consumption of meat at SLV as opposed to LFR.

Nitrogen data obtained here while excluding the reduced consumption of meat at SLV cannot rule out the high intake of cereals, which can in turn be confirmed by the higher occurrence at this site of porotic hyperostosis (Salvadei et al. 2001), a pathological condition that is, in fact, multifactorial but has also been linked to the elevated consumption of grains, whose high concentration of phytates impede the absorption of vital minerals such as calcium and iron (Stuart-Macadam 1989).

SECTION

Specific individuals

PARAGRAPH

A few outliers (Fig. 2) at LFR call for further questioning; one male (LFR FRS T3 C2) shows extremely low nitrogen values, which are consistent with a diet fully reliant on plant resources (Craig et al. 2006), together with the consumption of 15‑nitrogen-poor species, such as legumes.

The relatively lower carbon isotope ratio of another male (LFR ENELI A18) from the same site could be associated with consumption of aquatic resources, however as the nitrogen values are not entirely supportive for this it is more likely the case of C4 plant contribution to the diet.

With so little funerary data to differentiate between individuals within the cemeteries, it is difficult to correlate such a pattern to social or cultural phenomena; data will be explored in a wider paleobiological scenario in future studies.

SECTION

Concluding remarks

PARAGRAPH

The stable carbon and nitrogen isotope study conducted on human and animal bone collagen at Lucus Feroniae and Selvicciola has proven to successfully detect differences in foodways at the transition between the Roman Empire and Late Antique, as well as revealing intra-site variation.

The difference in the distribution of the isotopic signature at the two sites is likely a reflection of cultural phenomena that involved the way these two populations accessed and controlled food resources.

While the distribution of carbon and nitrogen values at Lucus Feroniae might reflect the profound heterogeneity that characterized the Roman world, the tight clustering of isotopic values at Selvicciola might represent a reflection of an unvarying diet, at least in the portion of proteins ingested, which in turn could be associated to uniform access to food resources.

Furthermore, the combination of isotopic and skeletal data might reveal a progressive impoverishment in the diet – now mostly reliant on grains – throughout the post-classical world.

This interesting evidence calls for further work on both Roman and Longobard populations of Italy, although the diachronic perspective proposed here has proven to intercept the decline in life conditions that followed the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and perpetrated throughout the Middle Ages.

Moreover, this study demonstrates that biochemical analyses are a good proxy to infer human behavior, particularly when combined with other biological information on human adaptation to changing conditions.
