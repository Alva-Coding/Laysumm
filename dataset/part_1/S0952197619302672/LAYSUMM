TITLE

The application of machine learning techniques for driving behavior analysis: A conceptual framework and a systematic literature review

PARAGRAPH

Driving Behavior is a complex concept describing how the driver operates the vehicle in the context of the driving scene and surrounding environment.

This paper outlines an unconventional theoretical framework whereby Driving Behavior is viewed in a holistic perspective in terms of dimensions and influencing aspects within the Driver-Vehicle-Environment system.

A premier and unbiased last-decade overview of the Machine Learning techniques adopted in assessing Driving Behavior was revealed, laying foundations for grasping the major contributions and shortcomings in the state-of-the-art research.

Interesting research questions were prepared, and their answers gave an eye-opening discovery for further research endeavours.
