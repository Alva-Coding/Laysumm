TITLE

Combining dynamic finite state machines and text-based similarities to represent human behavior

PARAGRAPH

Human behavior can be grouped to elaborate profiles that would enable the classification of individuals.

Nevertheless, the elaboration of profiles related to human behaviors presents some difficulties associated with the volume of data and the number of parameters typically considered.

Thus, the development of software able to automatize the manipulation of data through graphical assistants to produce understandable visualizations of the human behaviors is crucial.

The VISUVER framework uses finite state machines to represent and visualize the dynamic human behavior automatically.

It also includes similarity metrics based on text mining techniques to establish possible profiles among the analyzed behaviors.
