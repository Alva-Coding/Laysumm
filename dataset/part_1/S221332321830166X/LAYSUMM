TITLE

Non-convulsive status epilepticus associated with neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease: A case report and literature review

PARAGRAPH

We report a case of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) confirmed by skin biopsy.

This patient developed non-convulsive status epilepticus with generalized periodic discharges on electroencephalography after slowly progressive cognitive decline.

To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of NIID with non-convulsive status epilepticus.

Since adult patients with NIID display a wide variety of clinical manifestations, skin biopsy should be considered in patients who have leukoencephalopathy of unknown origin.

When NIID patients display impaired consciousness, cognitive decline as well as the possible association with NCSE should be taken into account to ensure adequate anti-seizure drugs have been administered.
