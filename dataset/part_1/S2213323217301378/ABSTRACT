ABSTRACT

TITLE

Seizures in HIV: The case for special consideration

PARAGRAPH

This study aimed to determine the rate, cause and management of seizures in the context of potential ARTâ€“ASD interactions in a cohort of HIV + individuals.

PARAGRAPH

Records of 604 HIV + patients were reviewed and those reporting epilepsy/seizure diagnosis were further evaluated.

PARAGRAPH

This cohort exhibited a seizure rate of 2.4%.

HIV + patients treated for epilepsy displayed low serum ASD levels and failed to achieve seizure control.

They were more likely to disengage from Neurology follow-up.

PARAGRAPH

For HIV + patients presenting with seizures/epilepsy the ASD prescription and the provision of supplementary support services needs to be carefully considered.
