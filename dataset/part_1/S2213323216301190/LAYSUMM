TITLE

Spiders, ladybugs and bees: A case of unusual sensations in a child with cingulate epilepsy

PARAGRAPH

Epilepsy is a disorder characterized by the predisposition to develop recurrent unprovoked seizures.

A seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.

Cingulate gyrus epilepsy represents a rare form of epilepsy and can be challenging to diagnose.

Seizures from the cingulate gyrus manifest with a variety of features such as fright, changes in mood, vocalizations, excessive motor movements and repetitive behaviours.

We describe a boy who developed cingulate gyrus epilepsy secondary to a low-grade tumor (ganglioglioma).

His seizures were characterized by unique sensory phenomenon â€“ spiders, ladybugs and bees.
