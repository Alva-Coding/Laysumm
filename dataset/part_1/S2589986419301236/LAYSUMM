TITLE

Hemispherotomy for drug-resistant epilepsy in an Indonesian population

PARAGRAPH

"Hemispherotomy is a surgical procedure for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, associated with unilateral hemispheric pathology.

Compared to hemispherectomy, hemispherotomy is a less invasive procedure and therefore maybe associated with fewer complications.

We report a series of patients who underwent hemispherotomy performed in our centers in Indonesia during a 20 year period and follow-up duration spanning from 24 to 160 months.

Our surgical techniques include (a) vertical parasagittal approach, peri-insular hemispherotomy and disconnection, and a modified ""Shimizu approach"".

To our knowledge this is the largest case series documenting hemispherotomy in an Indonesian population.

Surgical outcome resulted in seizure freedom in 62.5% of people and 81.3% who showed improvement in pre-operative seizure frequency."
