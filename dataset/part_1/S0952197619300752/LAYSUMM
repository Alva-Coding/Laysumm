TITLE

Integrated and concurrent detailed design of a mechatronic quadrotor system using a fuzzy-based particle swarm optimization

PARAGRAPH

Mechatronics design is a complex task involving many interdependencies between subsystems alongside a variety of objectives and constraints.

Due to this complexity, a concurrent, systematic and multi-objective design methodology is crucial to replace the often-used sequential approach which deals with the different domains separately.

This study presents a fuzzy-based approach for the modeling of a unified performance evaluation index in the detailed design of mechatronic systems by considering the interactions and correlations amongst the objectives.

Using this method, we carried out the design of a vision-guided quadcopter which demonstrated performance improvements compared to a commercial system designed with traditional approach.
