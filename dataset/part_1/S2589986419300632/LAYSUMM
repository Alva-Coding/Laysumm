TITLE

Unusual progression of an adult-onset subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) in Turkey

PARAGRAPH

Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a late complication of measles infection due to the defective cell-mediated immune response.

Compared with childhood SSPE, adult cases present with a more atypical presentation and a more aggressive course.

We describe an adult SSPE case which presented with psychiatric symptoms and had an aggressive course in order to emphasize that if not specifically considered SSPE can be missed in adult cases.

The incidence of measles is still high in the world and have continued to climb into 2019 and measles vaccination is the only measure that can reduce the risk of SSPE.
