TITLE

Adolescent-onset absence epilepsy years after resolution of childhood epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures

PARAGRAPH

Childhood epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures (EMAS) is a rare form of epilepsy associated with drop seizures at a young age.

It often resolves permanently.

This case report describes 3 boys who appeared to have typical EMAS, but then surprisingly developed absence type seizures during early adolescence.

In all three cases, the seizures came under control again.
