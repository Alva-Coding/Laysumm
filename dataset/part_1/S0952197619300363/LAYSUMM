TITLE

A minimax probability extreme machine framework and its application in pattern recognition

PARAGRAPH

Without making any assumptions on data distribution, we propose a minimax probability extreme learning machine, which combines the benefits of minimax probability machines with extreme learning machines.

It can be interpreted geometrically by minimizing the maximum of Mahalanobis distances to the two classes.

Then two variants of the MPME are presented.

The proposed methods can provide explicit upper-bounds for the generalization error.

By comparison with traditional methods, experiments show that the proposed methods achieve comparable results in generalization, and are easy to implement for nonlinear classification.
