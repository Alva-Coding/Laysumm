TITLE

Detecting prehistoric landscape features using thermal, multispectral, and historical imagery analysis at Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, Illinois

PARAGRAPH

A perennial challenge for archaeologists is locating the multiple components of archaeological sites, which can have uneven visibility and be spread across large distances.

In this paper, we present the results of advances in drone-acquired imagery alongside historical aerial photography to detect previously unknown and widely dispersed archaeological features at Middle Grant Creek, a late prehistoric village (c. 1600 CE) at Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, Illinois.

We detected probable housing and ritual areas and propose an expansion of the site from 3.4ha to 20ha.

These findings contextualize ongoing archaeological excavations and expand how archaeologists can identify and investigate archaeological landscapes.
