TITLE

The Mesolithic inhumation at Brunstad â€“ A two-step multidisciplinary excavation method enables rare insights into hunter-gatherer mortuary practice in Norway

PARAGRAPH

Evidence of Mesolithic mortuary practice is rare in Middle/Northern Scandinavia.

We present the newly discovered Brunstad burial, Norway, dating to c. 5900 cal BC.

This inhumation of an adult individual placed in flexed position, with bad bone preservation in very hard surrounding soils, could be recovered and reconstructed with the help of a two-step multidisciplinary excavation method.

Being rare in its regional context the burial exhibits features known from other Mesolithic sites in Europe, like island location, proximity to settlement and body position of the deceased.

We suggest that it might represent a distinct mode of burial at the time.
