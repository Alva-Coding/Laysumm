TITLE

Through diachronic discontinuities and regionalization: The contribution of the analysis of the lithic industries from Grotta della Serratura (Strata 10-9) in the definition of Epigravettian in the southern Italian peninsula

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

The paleogeographic changes which followed the last glacial maximum raised natural barriers and boundaries that probably form the basis of the division into two large post-Gravettian techno-complexes: that of central-western Europe, where the chrono-cultural unity of the Solutrean, Badegoulian, Magdalenian, Epimaddalenian/Azilian are developed, and the eastern and Mediterranean Europe, defined on a techno-typological and chrono-cultural scale as “Epigravettian province”.

PARAGRAPH

Originally defined by the Italian industries (Laplace, 1964), the Epigravettian includes the lithic complexes subsequent to the Gravettian; over time this taxonomical unity has been identified in an increasingly broader area, which now stretches from Provence to Armenia (Montet-White and Kozlowski, 1983; Montet-White, 1996; Djindjan et al., 1999; Kozlowski and Kaczanowska, 2004; Mihailović and Mihailović, 2007; Montoya et al., 2013; Tomasso, 2014).

PARAGRAPH

The Epigravettian in Italy was initially characterized by means of typological studies that established a chronological and structural framework, which are in part still valid today (Laplace, 1964; Palma di Cesnola, 1983, 1993; Bietti, 1997, Bietti et al., 1983; Martini, 1993; Broglio, 1997; Dini and Tozzi, 2005; Martini and Martino, 2005; Bertola et al., 2007; Martini et al., 2007).

The Epigravettian, with a chronological division into three phases, early (approximately 20,000–16,000 bp), evolved (approximately 16,000 to 15,000/14,500 bp) and final (approximately 15,000/14.500–10,000 bp), in turn divided into subphases on the basis of typological structures, show the extensive variability and configuration of the techno-complexes that compose it.

PARAGRAPH

The appearance of the regionalization phenomenon that burst forth during the Late Glacial in Italy is probably due to paleoenvironmental changes that have, at least in part, influenced the communication between human groups, who, by the time they settled into the different ecological niches in which they lived, gave rise to differentiated technical complexes.

This is why the attribution of “environmental wisdom” (Martini, 2015, p. 73), or the human capacity to interact with -a given territory, without adapting passively, but rather exploiting the resources and fully integrating, has determined that regionalization is reflected in the different industrial facies of Laplace (Laplace, 1964a, 1966).

However, within this “mosaic of cultures” common trends can be identified such as the microlithic progression of stone tools, certain stylistic and structural parameters, and the circulation of artistic-cultural manifestations, showing generalized trends throughout the peninsula (Palma di Cesnola, 1993).

In an attempt to understand the origin, evolution, and spread of these common trends that we find within a clearly indicated differentiation process, technological analytic reseach may provide new results.

In fact it is with the technological approach (Leroi-Gourhan, 1943, 1945; Lemonnier, 1976; Cresswell, 1983; Inizan et al., 1995), which has, at least in part, redefined the serialization of the Italian Epigravettian (Montoya, 2004, 2008b; Montoya, 2008a; Montoya and Peresani, 2005; Bertola et al., 2007; Tozzi and Dini, 2007; Cancellieri, 2010; Serradimigni, 2013; Tomasso et al., 2014).

Montoya (2004) proposed a new sequence for the early Epigravettian of northern Italy, subdividing it into three phases (ER1, ER2, ER3), based on the objectives of the lithic production and the methods adopted to achieve them.

These are organized in a chronological scheme that has recently been confirmed and completed by other studies concerning the Ligurian-Provencal arc and northern Tuscany (Tomasso, 2014).

PARAGRAPH

The present study, concerning the layers 10 and 9 (10C: 15,700 ± 110 bp uncal; layer 9: 13,100 ± 120 bp uncal) of the Grotta della Serratura site puts forth new and unpublished data (both typological and technological), contributing to the debate concerning the last Pleistocene industries of the Italian peninsula, and more generally, in the Mediterranean.

Preliminary typological analysis has placed these two horizons in the chrono-cultural phase of the Epigravettian evolved and final, respectively.

This work aims to complete its analysis by introducing new techno-economic data, thus beginning the collection of technological information still barely available in southern Italy for the final phase of the Upper Paleolithic.

Through the study of the operational chains and production systems one tries to define the technical traditions, for detailing the techno-complexes relative to the lower Tyrrhenian coast integrating them with a diachronic reading that will allow the identification of discontinuities and/or continuities within the sequence under consideration and on a macro-regional scale.

Materials and methods

SECTION

The site and the research

PARAGRAPH

The Grotta della Serratura opens onto the cobble beach at Lentiscelle, in the territory of Marina di Camerota (Salerno-Campania) (See Fig. 1).

The cave, generated by the karstic process fostered by the presence of a NE-SW directional fault, has always been affected by profound modifications resulting from eustatic changes in sea level.

In the Late Glacial, during the maximum Holocene transgression, the sea flooded the interior of the cave, realising the last major erosion that shaped the archaeological deposit located in the Atrium (Fig. 2).

PARAGRAPH

The research, which started in 1984 by the Universities of Siena and Florence in collaboration with the Archaeological Superintendent for the provinces of Avellino, Benevento and Salerno, continued systematically for over ten years.

Through interdisciplinary studies a first monograph was carried out (Martini, 1993), to which numerous studies on lithic industries (Martini et al., 2002; Lo Monaco, 2001; Martini et al., 2001; Ricci, 2018) and the supply of raw materials (Martini et al., 2003) were added.

PARAGRAPH

Palaeoclimatic and faunal contributions (Bertolini et al., 1996; Bon and Boscato, 1996; Colonese, Wilkens, 2005) have highlighted a series of climatic-environmental changes including the last glacial maximum and the Late Glacial.

Thanks to these studies the landscape has been defined, composed of various ecological niches: large flat areas favorable to aurochs, modestly present throughout the Late Pleistocene sequence, closed woodland zones and thickets on the ridges immediately behind the site, where deer and wild boar resided, and on which, at higher altitudes, tall forests emerged alternating with valleys, typical habitat for herds of deer (the animal primarily hunted with percentages >50% throughout the Epigravettian sequence).

PARAGRAPH

Numerous phases of prehistoric occupations are reconstructible through the integration of stratigraphic sequences highlighted in the two excavation areas (Figs. 2 and 3).

In the atrial area, about 12 m from the current entrance, horizons attributable to the middle Paleolithic and the upper Paleolithic (Aurignacian, Gravettian and Epigravettian) are preserved.

During the last excavation campaign there also was an Uluzziano level identified, sealed by stalagmite casting which divides the horizons of the upper Pleistocene from the earlier levels (unpublished data).

At different heights on the walls, up to 10 m above sea level, small strips of hardened sediment dating to the Late Glacial and early Holocene have been preserved, having resisted marine erosion which removed the more recent Pleistocene and the Holocene levels.

PARAGRAPH

The second area investigated, comprising the two horizons under consideration, is situated at a distance of about 30-40 m from the entrance.

The excavated trench (19 sqm) brought to light in the cave bottom what remains of a foredunes deposit accumulated almost exclusively as a cause of wind; This is documented by the strong inclination of the layers especially starting with the Final Epigravettian, and by their tendency to thin towards the bottom of the cave.

The entire sequence is based on a compelling stalagmite shelf which is lined by four levels attributed to the Aurignacian (layers 13 and 14) and the Gravettian (layers 11 and 12).

The Late Pleistocene sequence begins with the layer 10, a large layer of about 40 cm, rich in skeletal limestone and also of important dimensions, divided into six different detailed horizons under excavation on the basis of the location of structures (such as hearths) and the orientation of material on the floor.

The study of the lithic industries showed complete uniformity in the economy, in technical systems, techniques, and types, allowing us to consider them as part of a single macro-segment timeframe.

Layer 9, having a capacity of 13 cm, consists of a sandy-argillaceous deposit pattern containing slightly altered limestone skeletons of a small size.

PARAGRAPH

Followed by another eight horizons attributable to the final stages of the Epigravettian (layer 8, subdivided into 16 palaeosurfaces, subsequently marked in three horizons), the first Holocene (layers: 7, 6, 5 and 4) and the Neolithic (layers: 3, 2 and 1) (Fig. 4).

SECTION

Materials

PARAGRAPH

The lithic set analyzed is composed of a total of 3334 elements, divided into the 2316 pieces coming from layer 10 and 1018 elements coming from layer 9.

The layers containing this lithic group are preserved in the “deep cave” (Figs. 2 and 3).

This area, as mentioned, had been preserved from the marine erosions that partially disturbed the atrial part of the site, keeping intact the entire anthropogenic deposit covering a chronological range that spans from Neolithic to Epigravettian.

PARAGRAPH

The test material is rather fresh, with rare alterations of the surfaces due to chemical and/or mechanical post-depositional disturbances.

PARAGRAPH

The reliability of the archaeological record is also confirmed by the methods of excavation and recovery of materials.

The microstratigraphic excavation permitted the detailing within a single geologic layer, more horizons attributable to palaeosurfaces or to short-term events (layer 10: having a capacity of about 40 cm, divided into six horizons, detailed on the basis of the structures and materials found; layer 9: having a thickness ranging from 5 cm up to a maximum of 13 cm).

In addition, careful flotation performed using sieves with fine mesh (1 mm), has allowed the recovery of all the elements micro- and ultramicrolithic, debris, fragments, etc.

SECTION

Methodology

PARAGRAPH

The study of the lithic material was realized using a dual approach: typological (Laplace, 1964) and techno-economic (Perlès, 1991; Inizan et al., 1995; Pelegrin, 2000).

The latter chracterizes the innovative aspect of the study of the lithic industries of this site, and tries, through a broader perspective, to answer new questions and to add new data and information to the current knowledge related to the lithic production of the Late Pleistocene at the Grotta della Serratura and more generally the lower Tyrrhenian coast.

Typometric catagories already known in the scientific literature were also used: dimensional structure (Laplace, 1968), elongation index (Bagolini, 1968), complete carena (Martini, 1975) and width of the projectile (Martini, 1993).

The purpose of the technological study is the identification of the objectives of débitage and recognition of the behaviors, actions, gestures, and choices that led to the obtainment of these.

In an effort to isolate elements of discontinuity or continuity we have studied the industry rebuilding the chaîne opératoire in the classical sense (Inizan et al., 1995).

PARAGRAPH

First the different rock types were identified in order to trace the selection of the baseline volumes.

Subsequently the cores and the analysis of the initialization products and the operation of débitage allowed us to define the methods, and the analysis of full débitage products has allowed us to identify the refined products, methods, and techniques applied to obtain them.

Finally, the typological study (Martini et al., 2002; Martino, 2005) made it possible to detail the final stage of finishing the tools.

PARAGRAPH

Inside the lithic set of layer 10 a distinct presence of bipolar débitage from an anvil stone had been identified.

It was therefore necessary to make a specific database for each recognized category (cores, initialization products, and those of full production, bâtonnets,1 etc.), distinguishing, where possible, the same categories, usually grouped in the scientific literature under the name of “scaled pieces”2 (Escalon De Fonton, 1969; Cremillieux and Livache, 1976; Mourre, 1996, 1996a; Le Brun-Ricalens, 2006; Mourre et al., 2009–2010).

Often times within the group of knappings those products also converge, originating from any débitage, used the same way as a modern chisel, between the percussor and a more or less hard material (wood, bone, etc.).

This type of repeated action leaves identifiable traces such as bi-directional knapping.

We conform with the names used by certain authors (Hayden, 1980; Bicho and Gibaja, 2006; Gibaja and Bicho, 2006; de la Peña Alonso, 2011) defining them as “intermediary pieces”.

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

From a technological point of view the lithic industry of layers 10 and 9 shows differentiation already highlighted with typological studies (Martini et al., 2002; Martino, 2005).

The techno-economic analysis taken together allowed definition of the different production systems and techniques used within each horizon, detailing as well the different technical and behavioral traditions.

SECTION

The lithic industry of layer 10

PARAGRAPH

Layer 10 is composed of six different horizons.

The typological study (Martino, 2005) was achieved by combining the horizons 10 ABC (10 upper) and 10 DEF (10 lower) for the morpho-structural homogeneity of the industry within these two macro-groupings.

Technologically, the whole appears homogeneous, without any recognizable change in production objectives or in the operational chains.

PARAGRAPH

The set consists of 2316 lithic remains.

Not included in the count were materials that do not come from an action of knapping or human use (thermoclastic flakes and natural blanks).

SECTION

Raw material

PARAGRAPH

The geological analysis of rock types present within the archaeological series has been exhaustively conducted in previous studies (Martini et al., 2003; Martini et al., 2006).

This research, using a methodology of investigation well known in the scientific literature (Cipriani et al., 2000–2001) and a micropalaeontological analysis of samples, has led to the division of the analyzed material into different lithological categories and the allocation of these to the category of flint nodules or stratiforms.

Beyond the purely petrographic analysis, we will refer primarily to the three supply areas (Fig. 5) of the raw material (especially through the reading of natural surfaces of the cores and supports) in order to identify the collection areas in relation to the study of the mobility of hunter-gatherer groups who frequented the site.

PARAGRAPH

In layer 10 > 97% of cortices are very rounded, or rounded (secondary cortices), indicating a coastal collection (presumably the one on which the cave opens) or from a riverbed.

The presence in the archaeological sample of flints methodically well-selected (often devoid of internal fracture lines or other imperfections) seems to further support the hypothesis of collection in the riverbed or the beach whereby the river currents or waves induce a rapid fragmentation of the varied raw material.

PARAGRAPH

The lithic set of layer 10 is characterized by an almost exclusive use of cobbles, flint and jasper, more or less rounded; from initial volumes two categories can be identified: small cobbles 30–40 × 20–30 × 10–20 mm in size and cobbles 70–80 × 50–60 × 30–40 mm in size.

The presence of a product in quartzite is also noted, and of rare elements of very fine blonde flint, in which the cortex returns to a nodular volumes.

In addition, with a percentage lower than 2%, the use of a limestone at various stages of silicification should be noted, which is also recovered in the form of cobbles, in an areal neighboring the cave.

SECTION

The objectives of the production

PARAGRAPH

The production objectives include blades, bladelets, and laminar flakes, but also in good measure flakes and microflakes.

Generally there is a wide variability within these products which tend, in general, to be rather irregular, generally flattened, although there are more substantial examples.

PARAGRAPH

If the overall laminar index3 of the industry (36.7%) is observed, it is evident that this consists mainly of flakes, largely laminar.

It is emphasized that this value can, at least in part, be determined by the exploitation of numerous small cobbles whose initialization and operation produces a high number of flakes (first flakes and entame: 28%).

However, it has been identified both as an operating chain for the production of flakes, and a notable use of that form within those of the retouched tools (Fig. 6).

PARAGRAPH

Generally speaking, the production objectives are blanks which are not very slender at, more or less, parallel edges, sometimes convex or sinuous; of a straight or curved profile.

The sections vary from trapezoidal to triangular; the latter particularly refined, also in the triangular-rectangular type, as suggested by us the numerous bladelets coming from one side of the core or of a flake.

PARAGRAPH

Numerous elements corticated or partially corticated are also observed.

PARAGRAPH

It can be seen among the retouched blanks how certain by-products are generally used to produce specific tools; the scrapers for example, are for the most part obtained from cobble crowns or outdated blades (Fig. 12).

PARAGRAPH

In particular, the micro- and hypermicrolithic bladelet production is oriented towards the obtaining of classic projectiles (Fig. 7), typologically recognized in the typological groups of backed blades, backed truncation, from the backed points, and of the geometric (Laplace, 1964), which probably will add a batch of elements of micro- and hypermicroflakes, with abrupt retouching, whose typometric structure and morphological reoccurrence can allow them to be considered as a peculiar variant of projectile by flake (sensu Broglio, Broglio and Kozlowski, 1983).

PARAGRAPH

In general, the strong prevalence of common tools (85.6%) is noted in respect to the projectiles (14.4%).

SECTION

Systems of production and techniques

PARAGRAPH

The study of the objectives, of the products of operational and production systems has led to the identification of three chaînes opératoires: one of bladelets, one of laminar, and one relative to the obtainment of flakess and microflakes.

Within these it was possible to identify an important variability in the production systems, and in their mode of execution, tied to the type of volume on which these were made.

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

a.1- Lamellar débitage tournant and semi-tournant process on a single, smooth striking platform.

The exploitation advanced from a single element does not allow a return to the initial volumes of the starting block (Fig. 11 - 1, 2).

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

b.1- Débitage laminar-lamellar on medium-sized cobbles based on a frontal process, both along the narrower side, and on the wider surface.

Generally in a single smooth striking platform, inclined (from 60° to 85°).

The opening of a second striking platform seems to be aimed at detachments for maintaining the distal convexity (Fig. 11 - 4).

PARAGRAPH

b.2- laminar-lamellar débitage exploiting the convexity of the ventral side of a blank (kombewa), or on a “tranchet flake”, generally small or microlithic, for the production of bladelets with a triangular-rectangular section (Fig. 11 - 3).

PARAGRAPH

c- Flakes and microflakes débitage:

PARAGRAPH

c.1- Multidirectional cores for the extraction of flakes and microflakes, also elongated.

These cores, obtained on cobbles of small and medium size, present one or a short series of independent extractions, orthogonal to each other.

A volumetric organization of the core is not registered: sometimes naturally present angles and convexity on the selected volumes are exploited, usually following the opening of a striking platform.

PARAGRAPH

c.2- Cores of one or two surfaces of opposite percussion, exploited with a facial or semitournant manner, obtained on small cobbles (see the cobble volumes used for the bipolar débitage on anvil), for the extraction of microflakes, also elongated.

PARAGRAPH

Alongside these production systems the presence of a batch of cores, products, and by-products is noted referable to a bipolar production on an anvil (Table 2, Fig. 13).

Whether it is an autonomous operational chain, which starts with spherical cobbles of a diameter between 5 and 10 cm or by significant cobble caps, or if this represents the terminal stage of exploitation an initially chipped volume for direct percussion, it seems aimed at obtaining microlithic and elongated blanks.

Considering that the other systems of production brought the extraction of bladelets, heterogeneous and irregular in morphology and size, to subparallel edges and undifferentiated profiles, also typometrically lamellar supports may fall into this category as compatible with this bipolar production on an anvil.

PARAGRAPH

Generally the abandonment of cores coincides with the presence of incidents (deflections) due to the flattening of the débitage table or impurities and cracks present in the core, rarely with the depletion of the volume of the core itself.

PARAGRAPH

Within these production systems more percussion techniques can be identified (Pelegrin, 2000), relating to the different stages of production.

The use of hard stone for the opening of cobbles is well attested, generally through a transverse cortical flake on the greater axis of the same cobble, for the shaping of the core and the extraction of the elements of operation and maintenance of the core, such as the opening of the striking platform, the cleanup of the débitage table, some rather massive neocrests and initialization flakes and semitablette.

PARAGRAPH

It was possible to recognize the use of soft strikers, in stone or organic material, for the extraction of full production products: blades, bladelets, and laminar chips.

The use of soft strikers determines that attentive and insistent knapping of the overhang (abrasion and backward movement, very often both being present), that is clearly visible on the blanks.

PARAGRAPH

As previously mentioned above, the bipolar technique on anvil is present.

The use of this technique has been used, in small part, also for the opening of cobbles through “split”.

PARAGRAPH

The only anvil found in these levels is fragmented (111 × 83 × 26 mm).

It is a flattened cobble of Jasper, oval shaped and has a very fine textured cortex.

This has preserved on a surface edge rather limited retained traces.

Comparisons with examples found in the literature, experimental and archaeological, it is conceivable its use is for bipolar knapping (Mourre, 1996; Grimaldi et al., 2007; Donnart et al., 2009; Mourre et al., 2009–2010).

SECTION

General considerations on layer 10

PARAGRAPH

From the analysis of the lithic set from layer 10 of the Grotta della Serratura some behavioral and economical observations can be advanced.

PARAGRAPH

A characterizing element of the lithic production is the low technical investment relative to the implementation of volumes prior to the beginning of the débitage.

The choice of volumes, in this case the selection of flint and jasper cobbles, collected on beaches or in the riverbed in an areal neighboring the site (areal A, Fig. 5), represents the first stage of production; blanks are selected on which the necessary technical criteria are naturally present at the initialisation of débitage: optimum convexity, arris and natural angles.

The initialisation strategies of knapping varies depending on the initial volume of the selected cobbles (initiating “split” or through cortical flake; extraction of a flake/blade of entame, direct initialization of the débitage, shortening of the débitage table, etc.).

PARAGRAPH

It therefore observes a certain adaptation to the raw material linked to the morphology of each cobble.

There is not a recurrence in the management and operation of the cores, rather there is a “behavioral” recurrence of choices and strategies that every time seems to adapt to the particular volume to exploit.

PARAGRAPH

Operational strategies and maintenance of the cores are variable, with no particular recurrences.

There are few operational blanks counted: five crests, of which four are partial, six cleaning flakes from the débitage table, one semitablette and five revitalization chips.

The low technical investment relative to the operation and maintenance of the core is linked to the fact that most of the cores have been used for short series of removals, which is followed by the abandonment of the core itself, despite being still potentially usable in volumetric terms.

This can be attributed to the high availability of raw material in the vicinity of the site, since the typometric structure of refined products seems compatible with the absolute size of the core remnants.

PARAGRAPH

The knapping is in fact defined in short series of removals, facial, unipolar, or more rarely bipolar, along the axis of the greatest dimension of the volume both on the broader surface, and on the narrower side (Fig. 8).

In most cases a weak convexity of the surfaces and the presence of fairly open corners should be noted.

PARAGRAPH

The presence of three chaînes opératoires, integrated in part, led to the obtainment of a remarkable diversity of products (laminar, lamellar and laminar chips) differentiated by size, with a prevalence of microlithic elements of variable thickness and morphology.

PARAGRAPH

In the finishing phase of the tools greater attention is paid to the projectiles, above all in backed points, which are created on different bladelet types.

Within those of the common tools flakes, laminar flakes, and blades are mostly found and sometimes also operational elements or waste, on which specialized tools are created, such as long scrapers, end-scrapers, and pointed elements.

PARAGRAPH

Among the production systems of the level under consideration also includes the débitage and bipolar technique on anvil, although it is not always easy to recognize and safely attribute a product to certain categories between cores, products, subproducts, and intermediaries pieces (Hayden, 1980; Bicho and Gibaja, 2006; Gibaja and Bicho, 2006; Faivre et al., 2009–2010; Guyodo and Marchand, 2005; de la Peña Alonso, 2011).

PARAGRAPH

Bipolar on anvil production (cores, bâtonnets, quartier, products and byproducts), the use of “intermediaries pieces” and the final configuration of some instruments through flaking, assumes a relevant importance within these levels.

All these factors contribute to outline a peculiar behavioral aspect and of technical traditions that persist in all six horizons of layer 10.

Here then this débitage system, considered by definition an expedited system or purely economic, assumes a value of “choice” rather than “constraint” in the levels analyzed in this work, as evidenced in other studied cases (Soriano et al., 2009–2010).

PARAGRAPH

To this we can associate the lamellar removals on the sides of flakes and Kombewa extractions type, which are also typically targeted to the production of bladelets or elongated blanks.

The low technical investment in the operations of the débitage, the production of bipolar on anvil, débitage on the side of flakes and the Kombewa type extractions show a behavior and probably also an economic strategy linked to the abundance of raw material of good quality available in the immediate vicinity of the site.

SECTION

The lithic industry of Layer 9

PARAGRAPH

Layer 9 is composed of 1018 lithic elements (Table 2).

As in the underlying layer, no type of chemical alteration of the flint is observed; the elements tend to occur with fresh edges and without patinas.

SECTION

Raw material

PARAGRAPH

This horizon also records an exploitation of raw material (flint and jasper, followed to a lesser extent by siliceous limestone) mainly local, collected in the vicinity of the deposit in the form of cobbles of small and medium dimensions.

PARAGRAPH

Alongside these local elements, prismatic blocks of layered black flint appear, medium-grained and with bands slightly silicified, attributable to the area of Monte Sacro (Fig. 5), situated about 20 Km north of the deposit (Martini et al., 2003, 2006).

The aspect of the secondary cortex seems to indicate a collection from debris rather than in the river bed or on beaches, since there is no presence of a degree of rounding of the accentuated cortex.

SECTION

The objectives of the production

PARAGRAPH

The production systems are oriented towards obtaining blades, bladelets, and laminar chips.

The overall laminarity is 59.8%, while within the instrument group it exceeds 80%.

The flake component is relatively small, if one considers that nearly a third of the flakes, have indices of elongation such as to consider them laminar chips (Fig. 9).

There is no lack of elements that still retain a portion of cortex, rounded or subrounded, indicators of the use of volumes of small and medium size, collected in the form of cobbles.

PARAGRAPH

The refined products are of slender morphologies and have regular profiles, generally rectilinear and parallel or subparallel edges.

PARAGRAPH

This tendency towards regularity is noted especially in the projectile which is slender in profile (especially in the primary type of backed tips) and rather narrow, fusiform shape and with parallel sides, rarely irregular, with carena indices more or less elevated.

PARAGRAPH

The ratio of projectiles (42.9%) to common tools (57.1%), sees the latter the more dominant (Table 3, Fig. 10).

Among the projectiles there is a predominance of the backed blades, followed by backed points and backed truncations.

Absent are geometrics.

The overall laminarity index (59.8%) determines, within the substrate, the net prevalence of long scrapers at the expense of short forms; less than even the end-scrapers and denticulate.

This emphasizes the use of sub-products for the realization of common tools (Fig. 14).

SECTION

Production systems and techniques

PARAGRAPH

The small number of diagnostic cores (7 cases) does not allow the detailing of the production systems.

PARAGRAPH

There is a semi-tournant bladelet core, as well as two bladelet cores with frontal exploitation.

The first of which is unidirectional, with the débitage table localized on the short side, for the production of microlithic bladelets and flakes, also elongated.

The other is bidirectional, with the débitage table set on the longer side, also oriented for the production of bladelets, on a knapped core with two lamellar removals on one side, and three knapped cores exploited in a multidirectional manner.

PARAGRAPH

Even though it was not possible to reconstruct the operational chains due to the high fragmentation of these, from the analysis of the supports the laminar and lamellar products derived from the same production sequences can be assumed.

In fact dimensionally there are all the typometric classes: large and small blades and bladelets.

However this hypothesis finds no support in the presence of the operational and maintenance elements of the core, necessary for the implementation of long sequences on a core.

There are in fact only nine operations elements: five neocrests, three of which are partial, one partially shortened tablette, and three blanks for the recleaning of the débitage table.

PARAGRAPH

The striking platforms are always smooth, with an inclination of between 80 and 90°.

PARAGRAPH

The abandonment of the core coincides with accidents present on the débitage table (deflections), in which cleaning would remove a fair amount of the residual volume.

PARAGRAPH

Within the operational chains the use of multiple percussion techniques is identified: direct percussion with hard stone for the initial stages of débitage, and the use of soft strikers, organic or mineral, for the phases of full débitage.

SECTION

General considerations pertaining to layer 9

PARAGRAPH

At the economic level, in addition to the use of local raw materials, collecting cobbles in the form of small and medium size, there is the use of prismatic blocks from flint stratiforms located about 20 Km north of the site (Martini et al., 2003, 2006).

PARAGRAPH

The operating systems are installed on standardized volumes for morphology and size and do not involve a great technical investment in the preparation and maintenance of the core itself.

The knapping is set generally in short series of removals, facial, unipolar, or more rarely bipolar, along the axis of the greatest dimension of the volume on a wide and slightly convex surface.

After a first series of extractions aimed at the shortening of the tabular surface, the obtainment of products of full production arrives rapidly.

The strong technical constraints present in the volumes of the cores (rather open angle, the débitage table wide and slightly convex) makes it so the shock wave is propagated laterally, delivering very sharp and robust edged blades, with a strong cutting capacity (it should be noted that a distinct number of elements preserve macro-traces on which a traceological study is necessary to define the actual use).

The presence of an integrated production, in addition, determines a wide range of supports (laminar, lamellar, and laminar flakes) differentiated on a dimensional level.

On these are noted an important technical investment reserved for the ultimate finishing of the tools, with important modifications of the original blanks, through a typically deep and intrusive retouching.

In this last phase the lamellar products are standardized dimensionally, transforming them into projectiles (backed points, backed blades, and backed truncations), while within those of the common tools laminar products and laminar flakes are found, and sometimes even operational elements or waste, on which specialized tools such as long scrapers, end-scrapers, and sharp elements are created.

Summary and comparisons

PARAGRAPH

By comparing the analysis of the lithic industry of layers 10 and 9 of the Grotta della Serratura trends, similarities, and differences can be observed between the two levels.

Raw-material procurement does not show significant differences.

Chi-square test confirms the null statistical hypothesis (X2 = 7.4627; df = 4; P-value = 0.1134).

Flint and jasper cobbles of small and medium size collected from beaches or from the riverbed remains the main source for lithic production.

Nevertheless, in layer 9 prismatic blocks of black layered, medium-grained flint, with little silicified bands, make their appearance.

They are traceable to the area of Monte Sacro (Fig. 5), located about 20 Km north of the site (Martini et al., 2003, 2006).

This might suggests an enlargement of the catchment area during this phase (See Fig. 15).

PARAGRAPH

Among the differences, first and foremost is a change in the production objectives: despite that the refined blanks are always referable to blades, bladelets and laminar flakes, a strong increase in the regularity of the products4 should be noted, which in layer 9 assume slender forms, in edges and parallel or subparallel scars, and profiles that are straight or slightly curved.

The products also have differences in terms of dimensions, presenting those of a larger size in the upper layer (small and medium).

In general, there are also significant variations in the index of overall laminarity passing from 36.7% in layer 10 to 59.8% in the horizon above.

PARAGRAPH

To test these differences significance tests have been carried out.

A first test has been made grouping materials in three technological categories: “Blades”, “Flakes” and “Core trimming elements”.

In this latter category all the by-products of lithic production are grouped (cores, tablets, crested blades, debitage rejuvenation flakes, etc.).

Given that data nearly follow a Gaussian distribution, a chi-Square test has been carried out to see whether the differences in the composition of the assemblages between the two layers are significant.

The results reject the null-hypothesis of equal distributions (X2 = 35.916; df = 2; P-value = 1.589e-08).

In layer 9 there are much more blades than expected.

The other way around, in layer 10 flakes and core trimming elements show higher values than expected.

This might be interpreted as a result of a more opportunistic flaking behavior in layer 10.

In layer 9, are indeed missing all those elements that characterize the assemblage of layer 10, such the bipolar débitage on anvil, the kombewa extractions, the bladelet extractions on the side of flakes, and the brief extractive sequences on cores and their successive abandonment despite the volumetric potential that was still unexploited.

This change in the objectives may have different motivations (cultural?

functional?).

A second test has been carried out comparing the index of overall laminarity of the two layers.

The Welch's t-test indicates that the laminarity values significantly differs between layer 9 and 10 (t = −2.9866; df = 86.031; P-value = 0.003674).

As stated before, such differences derive from the fact that in layer 9 the mean laminarity index tends to 3 (2.9), being more elongated and slender than in layer 10 (mean lam.

index 2.3).

PARAGRAPH

Within the fractured elements among the two analyzed complexes the typological structure is also inserted, which, in addition to showing a considerable increase of projectiles (layer 10: 14.4%; layer 9: 39.8%) compared to the common tools.

A Fisher's Exact Test has been carried out grouping typological classes in five main groups: “Armatures”, “Burins”, “Substratum”, “Endscrapers” and “Truncated tools”.

Results (P-value = 1.065e-05) confirm a differential distribution of the tools between the two layers, and, in particular, the higher proportion of projectiles in layer 9.

This pattern can be read in the framework of broader structural, stylistic and typometric trends that took place during the final Epigravettian.

Among them, an increase of the truncated backed group and backed blades, the presence of standardized variants of parallel-sided backed bladelets and microbladelets and unilateral primary retouching, normally rectilinear, and the beginning of an inclination towards the reduction the width of the projectiles.

Among the scrapers that shortening process of the forms had now begun (Martini, 1993, Martini et al., 2002).

PARAGRAPH

Among the highlighted elements of continuity are the technical systems, the method of knapping, and percussion techniques that remain roughly unchanged (making an exception for the bipolar on anvil, the absence of which can determine the halving of the number of tossed pieces within the elementary structure).

Another parallel between the two compared industries is the low technical investment which is reserved to the operation and maintenance of the technical characteristics of the cores.

In both levels in fact, the only operational elements are a few neocrests, often partial, for the regularization of existing arris, and elements of recleaning of the débitage table that due to slight longitudinal convexity of the cores, are necessary for the removal frequent incidents such as deflections.

Discussion and conclusions

PARAGRAPH

The set of layer 10 of the Grotta della Serratura was placed in an advanced stage of the Epigravettian evolved (third subphase in the sequence of medium and low Tyrrhenian coast proposed by Bietti et al. in 1983), given that it is confirmed by the radiometric dating (10A: Beta-63294 15.350 ± 200 uncal.

bp; 10C: UtC-1421 15,700 ± 110 uncal.

bp).

The study of the microfauna (Bertolini et al., 1996) relative to the cave bottom deposit has permitted a decisively tempered interstage attribution to the various horizons of layer 10; the latest level, 10A, has been interpreted as a threshold of the Late Glacial and referred to as an interstadial by Angles.

PARAGRAPH

The typological structure shows a clear predominance of common tools in respect to projectiles; among the latter is a preponderance of backed points.

As a general rule no particular standardizations were encountered, neither morphological nor typometric; also the starting blanks are heterogeneous.

PARAGRAPH

The exploitation of local resources collected in the form of cobbles, from the riverbed or the nearby beaches, can be one of the factors that contributes to outline a specific behavior: the presence of certain unique methods for obtaining bladelet supports or elongated flakes, such as extraction by tranchet flake or the Kombewa method, the bipolar method on an anvil, and the presence, in the most structured systems, of a short series of independent removals, may designate a cultural character other than strictly economic.

In fact these elements have been interpreted as the result of an opportunistic behavior, that of being cursory, which is not found in the next level.

PARAGRAPH

From the faunal analysis (Ricciardi; Colonnese; personal communication) layer 9 has been attributed to the Bolling temperate phase.

In fact, beginning from this horizon the more recent Pleistocene stratigraphic series presents a general condition of dryness, with alternating temperate periods and episodes of climatic deterioration.

Also from a structural point of view of the lithic set, this level fits well at the beginning of the Late Glacial, showing tendencies and inclinations that would develop over the last Epigravettian.

Among these are the increase in projectiles at the expense of common tools, which suffer a significant decline also in the overlying layers (Martini, 1993), the increase within the short form end-scrapers and the high rates of laminarity, with the resulting prevalence of long scrapers at the expense of the short.

Moreover, there is the beginning of the reduction in the width of the projectile, the increase of the truncated backs, and a standardization of backed bladelets and microbladelets, with parallel sides and a straight unilateral back.

Among the backed points, a slight decrease with respect to previous levels, that highlight elements in which backed, straight, or more rarely convex are accompanied by additional retouches, normally inverse and simple, to highlight the apex.

The technological aspect shows on the one hand an important systematic continuity of the implementation of systems for the extraction of blades, bladelets, and laminar flakes, as seen by the objectives of the production, while on the other hand, there was no evidence those characteristics considered distinctive to the cursory attitude that characterizes the underlying layer.

PARAGRAPH

The brief chronological segment covered by the two horizons examined at the Grotta della Serratura, constitutes a moment of transition regarding the Epigravettian of the lower Tyrrhenian coast.

The important change of the objectives of the production, the presence of lithic types coming from a different supply areal and the significant differences on a structural level, in primis the reversal of the ratio of common tools and of projectiles in favor of the latter, allows us to integrate the two horizons by the straddling of the two different chrono-cultural periods: the end of the Epigravettian evolved and the start of the final Epigravettian.

PARAGRAPH

In this sense, the structural differences relating to certain production systems, the objectives of the knapping and the ultimate finishing of the instruments, might suggest a break in the technical traditions.

Nevertheless, a different use of the site or a change in the occupation pattern might as well influence the composition of the lithic assemblage.

Use-wear studies have shown that the artefactual composition of a certain occupation is largely determined by the economic practices that have been realized at the site (Donahue, 1988; Mazzucco and Gibaja, 2016).

However, other factors than the economic ones probably play a role, such as the duration and the demography of the occupation.

In the case of Grotta della Serratura, there is still no sufficient data to assess whether a cultural or a functional change is taking place.

In addition, apart the elements of discontinuity, there are some aspects that testify a cultural continuum, which proceeds, without interruption, until the final stages of the Pleistocene: the production methods, the techniques of percussion and the low technical investment in the operations of the cores, with the presence of the same mechanisms for the continuation of the débitage.

PARAGRAPH

The lack of technological data for the area under investigation does not allow comparisons with other sites, widely compared from a typological point of view (Bietti et al., 1983, Palma di Cesnola, 1993, Martini, 2007).

The phenomenom of regionalization involving the Italian peninsula during the Epigravettian also renders it difficult to parallel with the northern industries.

PARAGRAPH

To date, therefore, the proposed scanning for the Italian Epigravettian in the lower Tyrrhenian coast is unchanged and will be detailed and completed by a future technological studies that will identify changes and/or continuity not only from a diachronic point of view, but also on a micro- and macro-regionale scale.5
