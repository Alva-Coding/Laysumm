ABSTRACT

TITLE

Extraction and analysis of total lipids in reference materials and from pebble debris in a bath-shaped vessel from Zincirli, ancient Sam'al, Turkey

PARAGRAPH

Primary debris found in an Iron Age bath-shaped vessel excavated from Zincirli, ancient Sam'al, Turkey, was subjected to organic residue analysis by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS).

Bath-shaped vessels are usually interpreted as burial coffins, but recently these vessels have been linked to crafts manufacture, specifically wool processing.

To test this hypothesis, we compared the total lipid extract (TLE) of the debris to six reference standards drawn from a study of Old World wool processing practices.

Key components that may reflect the remains of date palm kernel oil, a substance known to be used in wool washing, were identified.
