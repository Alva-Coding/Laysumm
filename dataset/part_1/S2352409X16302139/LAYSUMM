TITLE

Extraction and analysis of total lipids in reference materials and from pebble debris in a bath-shaped vessel from Zincirli, ancient Sam'al, Turkey

PARAGRAPH

Bath-shaped basins from archaeological sites in the Levant date from the 8th through 6th centuries BCE.

Although generally interpreted as bathtubs or coffins, the archaeological context often fits an industrial interpretation.

To test the hypothesis of wool working activities, we sampled four vessels from Israel and Jordan using organic residue analysis.

Lipid profiles similar to date palm kernel oil (DPKO) were identified that matched the lipid profiles from a vessel reported in another publication.

The historic uses of DPKO as a textile soap support that bath-shaped basins functioned in wool processing.
