TITLE

Extraction and analysis of total lipids in reference materials and from pebble debris in a bath-shaped vessel from Zincirli, ancient Sam'al, Turkey

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

In this study, gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was used to analyze the total lipid extract (TLE) of pebble debris found inside an Iron Age bath-shaped vessel (see Section 2.1).

Residues in ceramic sherds and other porous structures may be analyzed to deconvolve their use (Evershed, 2008).

The recent discovery of primary debris in a bath-shaped vessel that was discovered in-situ in a domestic context at Zincirli, Turkey, provides an opportunity to test the hypothesis that bath-shaped vessels were used for wool-processing (e.g. scouring raw wool and fulling woven woolen textiles).

PARAGRAPH

Bath-shaped vessels dated to the Bronze and Iron Ages have been interpreted as burial coffins (Mazow, 2008, 2013).

These vessels, however, are found in both burial and non-burial contexts and therefore an interment interpretation does not uniformly fit the contextual evidence.

Mazow (2008, 2013) proposed that bath-shaped vessels were basins for washing and fulling wool.

This idea is based on: a number of bath-shaped vessels found in association with textile equipment and architectural parallels with Roman period fulleries.

Additionally, Mycenaean Linear B tablets from Late Helladic Thebes associate a bath-shaped vessel with a wool workshop where wool was both washed and fulled (Mazow, 2013: 220–221).

SECTION

Site background

PARAGRAPH

Zincirli is a 40 ha site in south-central Turkey identified as the ancient city of Sam'al (Fig. 1).

Several inscriptions show Sam'al as the capital of a small Iron Age kingdom that was eventually absorbed into the expansive Neo-Assyrian Empire (Dion, 1997: 99–112; Hawkins, 2008).

The site has produced several bath-shaped vessels, including one of copper, that derive primarily from non-burial, domestic contexts (Pucci, 2008; Herrmann, 2011).

The pebble debris in this study comes from one of two ceramic bath-shaped vessels discovered during recent excavations at the site (Herrmann, 2011: 237, 273–4, 391, Fig. 7.24).

Material and methods

SECTION

Archaeological context

PARAGRAPH

The pebble debris lined the base of a bath-shaped vessel excavated in Room A63, the inner room of a small two-room building (A/VI) in the southeastern part of Complex A (Fig. 2).

PARAGRAPH

Complex A is made up of small domestic buildings.

The building phase containing the ceramic basin is tentatively dated to the early to mid-eighth century BCE (Herrmann, 2011).

The bath-shaped vessel (L10-5053; 1.0 × 0.25–0.40 m) has straight walls with one rounded and one squared end (Fig. 3).

The rim had been broken off and removed and one wall was caved in, presumably when the floor of the room was raised by a fill of mudbrick detritus.

Beneath this fill, a dense layer of small rounded pebbles lined the base of the vessel.

These pebbles were larger than those found in the fill above and similar deposits were not found elsewhere in the room.

Therefore, they are considered to relate to the function of the vessel and predate the fill.

SECTION

Sample preparation and extraction

PARAGRAPH

The pebble debris had two clearly delineated layers: larger pebbles (in contact with the interior) and a finer (exterior) deposition layer.

Samples (~ 8 g each) were removed for organic residue analysis from the larger debris mass (Fig. 4).

These were placed into precleaned (450 °C for 4 h) 50 mL Pyrex test tubes and capped with precleaned foil, followed by a Teflon lined screw cap.

They were then extracted by sonicating in ~ 15 mL of a cocktail solution of GC grade hexane:acetone (1:1, v/v).

PARAGRAPH

Extracts were centrifuged (200 rpm, 10 min) and decanted into a rotary evaporator flask.

Each extraction was repeated three times and extracts combined.

The combined extract was evaporated to ~ 200 μL.

The residual solvent was then reconstituted in 2 mL of dichloromethane and filtered over a pre-cleaned glass wool-filled Pasteur pipette to remove any solid residue.

The extract was then concentrated to 0.5 mL using ultra high purity N2 (g).

An aliquot of this TLE extract was derivatized (70 °C, 60 min) with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA).

SECTION

Lipid quantification

PARAGRAPH

A Shimadzu QP5050A gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC–MS) equipped with a Restek Rxi-5Sil MS 30 m column (0.25 μm film thickness and 0.25 mm inner diameter) was used to identify lipids.

Approximately 1 μL of sample was injected into the GC–MS, with the MS set in scan mode.

Injector temperature was 250 °C, with an initial column temperature of 50 °C held for 1 min.

The oven was ramped at 25 °C min− 1 until 150 °C, 8 °C min− 1 until 204 °C, 4 °C min− 1 until 212 °C, 10 °C min− 1 until 240 °C, 20 °C min− 1 until 310 °C, and then held for 20 min.

The interface temperature was set to 310 °C.

The total flow of helium, the carrier gas, was 22 mL min− 1.

SECTION

Reference materials

PARAGRAPH

The chromatogram of the extract was compared to six modern reference materials.

These were selected based on an analysis of Old World wool processing practices and included: Lanolin, a non-water soluble by-product of wool processing; Olive oil, which appears in Linear B texts in association with wool processing (Melena, 1983: 117, 119) and is still used in modern hand-crafting industries to full wool; Date palm kernel oil, mentioned in Assyrian and Babylonian texts as a detergent and in ethnographic observations as a soap (Levey, 1954: 522; Potts, 2002); Sesame oil, one of the most common oils in Assyrian and Babylonian texts (Reculeau, 2009), has similar chemical compounds to olive and date palm kernel oil and thus could function as a soap although it is generally not used as such; Flaxseed oil, chemically similar to the other oils, is used in this study as an indicator of possible flax processing for linen textiles.

Beeswax was also included as a comparative sample as its chemical make-up is similar to the other lipids tested.

PARAGRAPH

For the reference materials, preparation was as follows: Olive oil, sesame seeds, flaxseed and dates were purchased from a grocery store.

The fruit of the date was removed from the kernel and dried at 50 °C.

The date palm kernel, flax and sesame seeds were individually ground in a mortar and pestle and extracted using a Dionex ASE 350 Accelerated Solvent Extractor.

Beeswax was purchased from Fisher Scientific and lanolin from MP Biomedicals LLC.

The beeswax, lanolin, and olive oil were extracted directly using liquid-liquid extraction.

Approximately 2–5 g of each reference material was extracted.

PARAGRAPH

The compounds that were isolated, their identification numbers, retention times, and the primary ion used for quantification are noted in Table 1.

PARAGRAPH

The compounds consist of both carboxylic acids and n-alkanes and represent the most abundant GC–MS peaks in samples and reference materials.

Results are reported as relative abundance of the peak area of each of 26 compounds in a sample, divided by the total area of all 26 peaks within that sample.

Each compound's peak area, if detected in laboratory blanks, was subtracted from that compound's area.

This adjustment was made in extracts of both samples and reference materials.

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

Chromatograms of the pebble sample extractions are displayed in Fig. 5A. Saturated and unsaturated lipids were detected in both samples.

Duplicate interior and exterior samples were analyzed and yielded identical chromatograms (data not shown).

PARAGRAPH

Total ion chromatograms of two of the six reference materials tested are displayed in Fig. 5B. Qualitative inspection of the chromatograms suggested that olive oil was the least similar to the pebble samples and the date palm kernel oil extract showed the greatest similarity.

To further explore the similarities, saturated and unsaturated lipids found in greatest abundance were compared between the pebble samples and reference materials.

PARAGRAPH

We focused on a selection of lipids in the reference material based on what was observed in the pebble extraction samples, comparing the relative amounts of these lipids to the pebble samples (Fig. 6A, B).

PARAGRAPH

All pebble extraction samples show highest relative abundance of hexadecanoic acid followed by octadecanoic acids, more closely matching the relative abundance of these same compounds in date palm kernel oil than in the other oils analyzed.

Beeswax has the greatest relative abundance of octadecanol, while the pebble samples have relatively low amounts of octadecanol.

Olive oil has the greatest relative abundance of oleic acid, which is relatively minor in the pebble samples.

Lanolin has the greatest relative abundance of octacosanol, which is present in the pebble samples but in relatively minor amounts.

PARAGRAPH

The ratio of relative abundances of the two most abundant compounds in the pebble samples was quantified and compared to that ratio in the reference materials.

The trimethylsilyl ester (TMS) of hexadecanoic acid and octadecanoic acid in the interior and exterior pebble samples were 1.6 and 1.3, respectively.

The ratio of hexadecanoic acid-TMS to octadecanoic acid-TMS was closest to that of beeswax and date palm kernel oil (1.8 and 1.0, respectively; Fig. 7).

PARAGRAPH

Beeswax contains tetracosanoic acid-TMS, a 23 carbon chain length saturated carboxylic acid, which is not found in either pebble sample.

A long chain saturated compound would be stable over geologic time and should not degrade to the point of being undetectable (Bianchi and Canuel, 2011).

In contrast, date palm kernel oil contains catechin, a compound also not found in the pebble sample extracts.

However, catechin contains several hydroxyl groups which readily lend themselves to being chemically hydrolyzed over time.

PARAGRAPH

In comparison with the six reference materials, the lipids recovered from the pebble debris most closely resemble date palm kernel oil.

Date palm kernel oil is expressed from the pit of the date palm fruit.

There are important characteristics that differentiate the kernel from its fruit, (Al-Shahib and Marshall, 2003; El Hadrami and Al-Khayri, 2012: 375, 378), but differentiating lipid profiles between fruit and kernel exceeded the limits of this study.

Thus, differences in use between fruit and seed cannot be ruled out.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The archaeological context of the bath-shaped vessel provides some evidence for domestic, possibly crafts, activities including separate activity areas, tools and crafts debris.

The interior room with the bath also contained a quern, three handstones, and several lumps of an iron-rich purple mineral, among other miscellaneous items.

In the adjoining entry (Room A39) were found two probable hearths, evidence of burning, and pieces of metal slag.

The small size and distinctive contents of this building suggest that it did not have a domestic function, but perhaps served as a multipurpose workspace.

Furthermore, the pebbly debris, seen also in the base of other bath-shaped vessels, may indicate that it pertained to the function of these vessels, possibly a by-product or to create a roughly textured work-surface (Mazow, 2014: 36).

PARAGRAPH

There are many uses for a large basin in date palm processing that could leave a residue similar to what was identified here.

Ethnographic and ethno-historic observations for date palm fruit and kernel use include: food, fuel, tar, medicinal and cosmetic practices (Baareveld, 1993; El Hadrami and Al-Khayri, 2012: 373–374, 380; Potts, 2002).

The manufacture of some of these would have necessitated a large basin.

For example, date pits are often soaked in large vats of water for animal fodder production; dehydrated dates can be rehydrated by soaking in water; immature dates can be artificially ripened by boiling in water (Baareveld, 1993).

Two archaeological studies also discovered date palm oil as an organic residue in ceramic artifacts: Patrich and Arubas (1989: 50) identified it in a juglet but rejected their identification due to a lack of written documentation for its use.

Namdar (2014), however, has presented evidence for date palm oil as a lighting fluid in Iron Age oil lamps.

PARAGRAPH

One recorded use for date palm kernel oil is a detergent (Levey, 1954: 522; Potts, 2002).

Raw wool contains environmental contaminants (e.g. dirt, dung, vegetal matter) and natural impurities (e.g. wool wax and suint) (Collins and Davidson, 1997: 42), some of which can be easily removed, but to obtain certain working qualities raw wool needs to be washed.

A water wash, however, is insufficient to remove lipid-like substances such as waxes.

Wool with minor wax content can be worked, but some sheep produce elevated amounts of wool wax that must be removed before further processing.

Removing the wax requires high water temperatures, which could injure the wool fibers, or the addition of a detergent.

A detergent is also used in wool fulling, an additional processing that uses agitation to matt the woolen fibers.

PARAGRAPH

Textile soaps used for wool scouring and fulling are those not injurious to wool fibers (Hurst and Simmons, 1921).

A dilute ammonia solution can be used, seen in ancient references to stale urine for laundering and fulling woolen textiles (e.g., Pliny, 1855), but other plant-based oils and clays are also mentioned (Robertson, 1986).

In textile manuals, olive oil is said to produce the best results (Hurst and Simmons, 1921), and is also mentioned in ancient sources in connection with wool processing.

Date palm kernel oil is not typically named among textile soaps, but it is chemically similar to coconut oil, which is listed, and would serve as a suitable textile soap (Devshony et al., 1992: 595).

Thus its mention in Assyrian and Babylonian texts as a detergent aligns with known uses.

SECTION

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

The identification of date palm kernel oil in the Zincirli bath-shaped vessel lends support for alternative uses for these bath-shaped vessels other than burial and for the hypothesis that bath-shaped vessels were used as wool processing installations.

In that context, it is interesting to note a graffito of a date palm and a weaving loom on an Iron Age stone bath-shaped vessel from Khirbet al-Mudayna (Chadwick et al., 2000: 260; Boertien, 2013) that points to a relationship among these three elements.

PARAGRAPH

While it is true that many bath-shaped vessels are found as interment vessels, burial may have been a secondary use for these large basins (Mazow, 2014: 36).

The components of date palm kernel oil would make it suitable as a soap (Devshony et al., 1992: 595, 596; El Hadrami and Al-Khayri, 2012: 373, 379), but there is no current evidence of its use as a bathing soap.

Although this does not rule out the possibility that bath-shaped vessels were used for human bathing, there are other known uses for date palm kernel oil that better fit the contextual evidence.

The discovery of bath-shaped vessels in association with crafts industry, including textile equipment, the ethno-historic data on bath-shaped vessels in wool processing and the graffiti do provide support for the use of date palm kernel oil in the wool industry.
