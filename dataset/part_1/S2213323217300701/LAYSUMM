TITLE

Seizure freedom following surgery for multi-focal epilepsy due to cerebral malaria

PARAGRAPH

Nearly one third of cerebral malaria (CM) survivors develop neurological conditions including epilepsy.

This report presents a rare case of chronic epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) secondary to CM.

Detailed clinical course, electrographic and imaging findings, and response to treatment including epilepsy surgery are described.

This report demonstrates that CM-associated HS can be drug-resistant.

Electrographically, the majority of recorded seizures arose from one hemisphere ipsilateral to the HS.

Interictally, multiple independent spike foci (MISF) with posterior temporo-occipital predominance were seen.

Even with multiple potential epileptic foci, a standard anterior temporal lobectomy can be performed with successful results.
