TITLE

Ceramic production at Selinunte (Sicily) during the 4th and 3rd century BCE: New archaeometric data through the analysis of kiln wastes

PARAGRAPH

Thin-section microscopy and chemical analyses (coupled ICP-MS ICP-OES) were jointly applied to establishing a ‘reference group’ representative of the ceramic produced at Selinunte in south western Sicily during the 4th and 3rd century BCE.

Homogeneous textural/compositional features characterize the thirty-seven ceramic samples, representative of daily-use common ware, collected from the dump of two kilns sited in the FF1 production area.

The obtained chemical ‘reference group’ is fully compatible with the geo-lithological characteristics of the area and shows satisfactorily low standard deviations.

It will be applied to better define the ceramic trade networks in south western Sicily at that time.
