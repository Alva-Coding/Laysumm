TITLE

A non-metric traits study of skulls from Epiclassic Xaltocan in relation to other Mesoamerican cultures

PARAGRAPH

Very little is known about the Epiclassic period in relation to the other cultures but very important since it is giving rise to the conformation of the cultures which follow.

Lake Xaltocan is in the Basin of Mexico and geographically near to TeotihuacanÂ´s site.

More than a hundredth of skulls of sacrificed people were found in Postclassic Xaltocan.

Until now it has been mostly accepted, in the anthropological community, that the inhabitants of the Postclassic Xaltocan were conformed by migrations from Teotihuacan decline.

Our study through genetic inherit characters makes clear that the group of sacrificed people does not belong from Teotihuacan.
