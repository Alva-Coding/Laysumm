TITLE

A MEMCIF-IN method for safety risk assessment in oil and gas industry based on interval numbers and risk attitudes

PARAGRAPH

In safety risk assessment problems, multi-expert and multi-criterion are often involved and assessment data are often given in form of interval number (IN).

To incorporate risk attitudes into assessment, we propose the definition of interval number with distribution function and utility function.

The frequency and consequence are only two needed indicators in risk matrix and their values are needed in form of crisp value.

So the semi-quantitative safety risk assessment in oil and gas industry is a multi-expert and multi-criterion based on interval number (MEMC-IN) information fusion problem.

A MEMCIF-IN model is proposed to solve this problem in our paper.
