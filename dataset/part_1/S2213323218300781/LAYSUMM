TITLE

Improvement in anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antibody-mediated temporal lobe epilepsy with amygdala enlargement without immunotherapy

PARAGRAPH

In recent years, an increasing number of reports have indicated an association between amygdala enlargement (AE) and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).

However, the etiology of AE remains unknown.

Here, we report a case involving an adult female patient with TLE-AE characterized by late-onset seizures and cognitive impairment.

Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibodies were detected in her cerebrospinal fluid.

However, administration of appropriate anti-seizure drugs, without immunotherapy, improved her clinical symptoms.

Moreover, reduction in the volume of AE was observed on MRI.

We believe that our patient presented with a milder form or “forme fruste” of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.
