ABSTRACT

TITLE

Provenance identification of the high-fired glazed wares excavated from the Late Jin Dynasty (Dong Xia State) sites in Russia's Primorye Region

PARAGRAPH

In this work, twenty-three pieces of high-fired glazed samples from the archaeological excavations of the Dong Xia sites in Russia's Primorye region were studied.

In addition to visual observation, energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) techniques were jointly applied to the analysis of the chemical composition and microstructure of the samples.

The major emphasis was placed on the provenance identification of the white, opalescent glazed, and celadon samples.

Seven excavated fine whiteware samples were confirmed as the products from the Ding Kiln in the Jin Dynasty, and nine samples as the Jun-series wares.

The most important conclusion out of the study is that two celadon samples with opaque glaze were proved to be the Ru Kiln wares.

This finding implies that the Ru ware is identified for the first time in the Dong Xia sites of Russia's Primorye region.

This work is a successful case of interdisciplinary cooperation in the medieval archaeometry of the Far East.
