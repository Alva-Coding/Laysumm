TITLE

Sources of obsidian for the Sinagua of Northern Arizona (USA)

PARAGRAPH

Prehistoric peoples in the American Southwest made stone tools of obsidian (volcanic glass).

Sources of obsidian are chemically distinct, and using x-ray flourescence (XRF), artifacts can be connected to particular sources.

We analyzed 343 projectile points and 271 pieces of flaking waste from a group of Sinagua sites (1050-1300 AD) near Flagstaff.

Obsidian in these sites mostly came from the Government Mountain source, 30 km west, with a few pieces from another nearby source.

Two points made of obsidian from southern Arizona and New Mexico represent exchange.

The earlier pre-agricultural points in our area show more variety, suggesting that these Archaic people were more mobile.
