TITLE

DFNet: Discriminative feature extraction and integration network for salient object detection

PARAGRAPH

Salient object detection aims at localizing the most interesting and prominent parts of an image, and it is an effective pre-processing step for many computer vision tasks.

Accurately detecting salient objects in complicated scenarios is still a challenge in computer vision.

In this paper, we propose a novel real-time salient object detection model which is able to adaptively weight feature maps from different scales and different levels of abstraction.

In addition, our Sharpening Loss function guides our network to output saliency maps with higher certainty and less blurry salient objects, and it has far better performance than the Cross-entropy loss.
