TITLE

Following the yellow brick road: Yellow slip clays and the production of Rio Grande Glaze Ware in north central New Mexico

PARAGRAPH

We argue that San Marcos potters were using clay from Tunque Pueblo to cover the outside of their vesselsduring AD 1400-1700 in New Mexico.We used LA-ICP-MS to analyze 72 samples.

LA-ICP-MS aids in determining the chemistry of different clays pottery is made from, which then allows us to potentially determine the geographic origins of those clays.

Given San Marcos pottersâ€™ apparent reliance on this yellow clay over time, our findings demonstrate that extremely stable social networks were developed and sustained among Rio Grande Pueblo households and communities across north central New Mexico.
