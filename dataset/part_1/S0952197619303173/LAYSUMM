TITLE

Multi-phase trajectory optimization for an aerial-aquatic vehicle considering the influence of navigation error

PARAGRAPH

We introduce an aerial-aquatic coaxial eight-rotor to complete an underwater target track task from air to underwater.

The vehicle should adjust the angular velocities of rotors to realize a smooth diving process.

When the vehicle navigates underwater, the navigation information is provided only by INS.

We establish the inaccurate navigation information model and applies it to collision detection and cost function setting in the trajectory optimization.

We improve the TLBO algorithm referring to PSO algorithm by modifying the formula of updating academic records in the teaching procedures.

The convergence rate and the solution quality are both improved.
