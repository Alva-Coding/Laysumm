TITLE

Fire conditions and source materials recorded in scoria from an intentional fire at Store Tovstrup Iron Age house, Central Jutland, Denmark

PARAGRAPH

Minute glassy particles occur in the burn field after an Iron Age longhouse (500-100 BC).

The particles are made of rounded quartz and orthoclase grains, gas vesicles, and carbonaceous material bonded together by a potassium-rich silicate glass.

The presence of gas vesicles and carbon suggest that melting of a mixture of biomass ash and soil was initiated at 700-800oC and continued to about 1000oC.

A source of 50% sandy soil, 41% barley straw, and 9% oak branches best explains the glass composition.

The fire was of short duration resulting in partial melting of a daub wall and the collapse of the house.
