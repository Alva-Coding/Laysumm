ABSTRACT

TITLE

Valproic acid as a monotherapy in drug-resistant methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) duplication-related epilepsy

PARAGRAPH

Duplication of the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) is a rare condition that results in epilepsy in half of the cases.

Although this condition has been well characterized in the literature, there is a lack of research on MECP2 duplication-related epilepsy and its management.

PARAGRAPH

We present the case of an eleven-year old male with MECP2 duplication and epilepsy, who was resistant to polytherapy.

The patient responded well to valproic acid (VPA) initially and upon re-challenge.

This case report provides evidence for the use of VPA as an initial monotherapy for treatment of drug-resistant MECP2 duplication-related epilepsy.
