ABSTRACT

TITLE

Landscape applications of photogrammetry using unmanned aerial vehicles

PARAGRAPH

Photogrammetry is quickly becoming an important, cost effective technique for recording cultural heritage.

Beyond the micro-scale of site evaluation, however, there are also effective landscape applications, with drone-based image collection allowing for large-scale survey.

This combination of highly portable technology, which is not fully automated, can be used to create accurate and dense three-dimensional models at a fraction of the cost of LiDAR, and often at a much high spatial resolution.

Yet, despite this, few studies have assessed the viability of this technique in regard to landscape studies.

Those that have, such as Mu√±oz-Nieto et al. (2014), highlight the effectiveness of this technique and its ease of use.

This paper assesses the viability of this technology for mapping large archaeological sites such as hillforts, providing a case study for its application to landscape archaeology.
