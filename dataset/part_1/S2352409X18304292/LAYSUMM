TITLE

Landscape applications of photogrammetry using unmanned aerial vehicles

PARAGRAPH

Photogrammetry is quickly becoming an important, cost effective method for recording cultural heritage.

This technique, which converts overlapping photographs into three dimensional models, is more commonly used on artefacts and other micro-scale features.

However, there are also effective landscape applications, with drone-based image collection allowing for large-scale survey of monuments and landscapes.

Despite this, few studies have assessed the viability of this technique in regard to landscape studies.

This paper provides a series of case studies for the application of photogrammetry in archaeological landscape studies.
