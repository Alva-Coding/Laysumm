ABSTRACT

TITLE

Investigating 14th century immigration and settlement response on the Georgia Coast, USA

PARAGRAPH

Following the 14th century depopulation of the Savannah River Valley of modern Georgia and South Carolina, the neighboring coastal region of Georgia exhibited significant changes in settlement.

In the absence of other demographic proxies, Georgia state site file data show that there was a greater accumulation of archaeological components during the 14th century than in any other preceding period.

Exploratory Bayesian modeling of settlement practices using a compiled set of legacy radiocarbon dates demonstrates that much of this expansion of settlement happened concomitant with the depopulation of the Savannah River Valley.
