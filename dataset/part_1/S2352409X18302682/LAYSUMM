TITLE

Investigating 14th century immigration and settlement response on the Georgia Coast, USA

PARAGRAPH

Analysis of archaeological settlements along the coast of Georgia, USA, shows evidence of a large-scale migration to the region around 1400 CE.

The nature of settlement change and the timing of the creation of new settlements on the coast are related to the abandonment of the nearby Savannah River Valley.

Immigrants from the Savannah River Valley may have chosen to settle among existing communities on the coast due to preexisting social connections and the offer of alternative life-ways following the abandonment of their previous social systems.
