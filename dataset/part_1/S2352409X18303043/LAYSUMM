TITLE

Exploring the potential of human bone and teeth collagen from Prehistoric Cyprus for isotopic analysis

PARAGRAPH

This study proposes to document the diet of humans living in Cyprus during Prehistoric times.

We measured carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios on human bones from six archaeological sites, as well as few Prehistoric animal bone remains and modern botanical samples.

The bone samples were poorly preserved but data obtained on few individuals indicate that protein consumed came from terrestrial animals and plants and that marine resources was not or little consumed if any.

The comparison with other sites in the Near East also showed that some plants as legumes could have been a significant resource for Prehistoric human groups in this area.
