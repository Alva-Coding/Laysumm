TITLE

Using bone fragmentation records to investigate coastal human ecodynamics: A case study from Čḯxwicən (Washington State, USA)

PARAGRAPH

Ancestral Klallam people established residence around 2700 years ago in the shelter of Ediz Hook, a long spit on the Strait of Juan de Fuca, coastal Washington State.

Čḯxwicən (pronounced ch-WHEET-son) village grew over time as the beach area expanded and created a lagoon.

More than once, tsunami generated by large plate boundary earthquakes off the coast traveled up the Strait, overtopping the spit and the site, depositing sand, causing erosion, and in one case knocking down a house wall.

People returned and rebuilt in the same house locations multiple times, suggesting investment and persistent ties to specific locations.
