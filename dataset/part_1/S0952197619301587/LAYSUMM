TITLE

Accelerating decentralized reinforcement learning of complex individual behaviors

PARAGRAPH

This paper proposes to use Decentralized Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to alleviate the effects of the curse of dimensionality on the action space, and to use transfer knowledge to reduce the training episodes.

Three DRL schemes are compared and analyzed in two complex real-world problems performed with humanoid biped robots.

The obtained results show the effectiveness of DRL systems, which even without prior-coordination are able to achieve asymptotic convergence throughout indirect coordination.

By using the proposed methods is possible to reduce the training episodes, and to coordinate the DRL process
