TITLE

Perampanel: A therapeutic alternative in refractory status epilepticus associated with MELAS syndrome

PARAGRAPH

Most status epilepticus in mitochondrial diseases are refractory to treatment, however some drugs used in status are potentially risky in these patients.

Perampanel is emerging as an option to treat status epilepticus due to its particular pharmacodymanics.

We present three cases of MELAS with refractory status epilepticus (non-convulsive without impairment of consciousness), in which the treatment with high-dose perampanel resolved the acute situation within few hours.

These examples show that perampanel may be an effective option in these situations.
