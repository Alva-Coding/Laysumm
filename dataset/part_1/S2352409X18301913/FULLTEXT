TITLE

Genetic analyses of Scandinavian desiccated, charred and waterlogged remains of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Barley, Hordeum vulgare, is an important cereal crop in the temperate world, used as both food and feed (reviewed in Newton et al., 2011).

It is a diploid and self-fertilizing species, first domesticated around 10,000 years ago (Zohary et al., 2012).

Studies of geographical distribution of genetic diversity suggest multiple domestication events (Dai et al., 2012; Morrell and Clegg, 2007; Ren et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016) or an origin from a mosaic ancestry from wild progenitors from a wide geographic region (Poets et al., 2015).

PARAGRAPH

Subsequent to domestication, barley spread over large areas of the Old World.

Geographic structuring of the genetic diversity of barley has been shown both among and within continents (Jones et al., 2011; Morrell and Clegg, 2007; Muñoz-Amatriaín et al., 2014; Pasam et al., 2014; Poets et al., 2015).

This geographic structure results from both the different routes of the spread of barley as well as from climate adaption (Jones et al., 2011; Pasam et al., 2014).

There is also differentiation between the gene pools of two- and six-row barley and naked and hulled forms (Jones et al., 2011; Malysheva-Otto et al., 2006).

PARAGRAPH

Barley has long been an important crop in northern Europe and Fennoscandia where it was introduced during the early Neolithic in 4000 BCE.

Naked barley was introduced first, with hulled forms appearing around 1000 BCE to later dominate the barley cultivation of this region (Grabowski, 2011).

Two-rowed barley has been recorded from 17th century but was likely introduced earlier (Hjelmqvist, 1996), and became important in production only as of the end of the 19th century (Myrdal and Morell, 2011).

PARAGRAPH

By studying barley grains from 19th century seed collections, the presence of fine scale population structure was shown to exist across Fennoscandia (Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland) with geographic structure according to latitude extending across country borders (Forsberg et al., 2015; Leino and Hagenblad, 2010).

Although these findings suggest a role of climate in shaping the geographic structure, it is not known whether the observed geographical structure is a recently developed phenomenon or what time depth these patterns reflect.

Comparisons of barley from Northern Fennoscandia collected some three decades apart (years 1869–1896) suggest that shifts in the genetic structure over time can occur (Forsberg et al., unpublished data).

However, in order to gain deeper knowledge of the temporal distribution of population structure, genetic analysis of archaeological materials is needed.

PARAGRAPH

Archaeological remains of cereal grains are mostly found in charred condition (Dennell, 1976).

However, analyses of DNA from charred grains have met great difficulties (e.g. Boscato et al., 2008; Oliveira et al., 2012b, reviewed in Brown and Barnes, 2015; Palmer et al., 2012), although occasional positive results have been reported (e.g. Bilgic et al., 2016; Bunning et al., 2012; Castillo et al., 2016; Fernández et al., 2013).

Recent high-throughput analysis of 38 charred or partially charred archaeobotanical samples from four species (including barley and rice) indicates that charred cereal grains entirely lack endogenous DNA, raising concerns regarding the authenticity of the data generated in previous studies (Nistelberger et al., 2016).

PARAGRAPH

Plant specimens are also sometimes found in waterlogged conditions.

Like charring, waterlogging is considered suboptimal for DNA preservation (Schlumbaum et al., 2008) and successful studies of aDNA in waterlogged, archaeobotanical specimens all concern species with strong fruit endocarps such as grape seeds (Cappellini et al., 2010; Manen et al., 2003; Wales et al., 2016), olive fruit stones (Elbaum et al., 2006), Prunus fruit stones (Pollmann et al., 2005), apple seeds (Schlumbaum et al., 2012) and bottle gourd seeds (Schlumbaum and Vandorpe, 2012).

Cereal grains have much softer grain testa, and for this reason, they have been considered less well-protected against hydrolytic degradation of DNA.

To our knowledge few attempts have been made to analyse waterlogged cereal grains, and no positive results have been reported (Brown et al., 1993; Fernández et al., 2013).

PARAGRAPH

With cereals, the most successful studies of aDNA thus far have used desiccated materials (Hagenblad et al., 2017; Li et al., 2016; Li et al., 2011; Mascher et al., 2016; Oliveira et al., 2012b).

Both multiple copy and nuclear single copy markers have been used successfully with desiccated plant materials, as well as more high-throughput sequencing methods, with the aim to identify taxonomic origin and compare genetic diversity between old specimens and extant landraces.

PARAGRAPH

To our knowledge, there are few studies that have investigated archaeological remains of cereal grains preserved under different conditions.

Here we report a study of barley specimens preserved under a range of conditions, investigating their respective genotyping potential using PCR, standard sequencing and Kompetive Allele Specific PCR genotyping.

We also make use of the resulting genotype data to study possible temporal changes in population structure of southern Scandinavian barley.

Methods

SECTION

Archaeological samples

PARAGRAPH

Barley grains from excavations in southern Sweden and Denmark from different ages and preservation conditions were used in this study.

A total of 46 charred grains (of which five samples, with prefix “MÅ”, had been found in the plaster of an old wall, making visual evaluation of preservation status difficult), nine desiccated grains from the 17th century grave of Bishop Peder Winstrup, deceased in 1679, and 19 waterlogged specimens were included (Table 1) (Heimdahl, 2012a, 2012b; Heimdahl and Bergman, 2017; Heimdahl and Vestbö Franzén, 2009; Lagerås, 2016; Nordström and Lindeblad, 2016; Tagesson et al., 2014).

Estimated ages, based on dendrochronology combined with radiocarbon dating, typology and stratigraphy, ranged from 250 to 850 years old (for examples of samples analysed, see photos in Fig. 1).

SECTION

aDNA extraction, PCR and sequencing

PARAGRAPH

DNA extractions were primarily conducted on single grains, but five assembly samples, where individual grains could not easily be distinguished, were also included (samples MÅ F_1, MÅ F_2, MÅ F_3 and GB A_1 – GB A_2).

All extraction work was carried out in either of two dedicated ancient DNA laboratories, one located at Warwick, the UK, and the other in Oslo, Norway, following stringent routines to avoid introducing contaminants (Cooper and Poinar, 2000; Gilbert et al., 2005).

Neither of the laboratories had been used for work with modern DNA, and they were located away from areas where PCR was carried out.

DNA from charred and waterlogged specimens was extracted as described in Smith et al. (2014).

Extractions included seven negative controls to confirm authenticity.

The Gilbert method, as described in Wales et al. (2014) but with the overnight incubation at 37 °C, was used for the nine desiccated specimens and one negative control sample.

Quantification of DNA from charred and waterlogged samples was performed using Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life technologies).

PARAGRAPH

All PCRs were set up in a class 1000 clean room facility not previously used for work with plant DNA or PCR.

Semi-nested PCR was performed using M13-tagged primers targeting the P6 loop of the chloroplast trnL intron (Taberlet et al., 2007; Willerslev et al., 2007).

Each reaction contained 1 U of DreamTaq DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific), 1× DreamTaq Buffer (Thermo Scientific), 0.2 mM of each dNTP (Thermo Scientific), 2 μg/μl of BSA (Thermo Scientific), 0.1 μM of each primer (trnLg with M13F-tag: TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGGGCAATCCTGAGCCAA; trnLh with M13R-tag: CAGGAAACAGCTATGACCTTGAGTCTCTGCACCTATC) and 1 μl of DNA template.

For the second PCR amplification no BSA was used, and the primers were matching just the M13 tag (M13F: TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT; M13R: CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC).

The first of the two semi-nested PCRs was run at the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2.5 min; 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 15 s; and final elongation at 72 °C for 8 min.

Conditions for the second of the two semi-nested PCRs were: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2.5 min; 8 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 30 s with a decrease of 1 °C per cycle, and 72 °C for 20 s; 20 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 20 s; and final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min.

Desiccated materials were run with 17 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 20 s.

PARAGRAPH

PCR products were evaluated on 3% agarose gels pre-stained with SYBR Safe (Invitrogen).

Samples yielding amplification of the expected size and with no additional bands were, together with their corresponding PCR controls (using the controls extracted in parallel with the grains as template), sequenced by Macrogen Europe (The Netherlands).

The resulting sequences were both BLASTed against the full nucleotide sequence database at the National Center for Biotechnical Information (NCBI) as well as aligned to published trnL sequence from barley (GenBank ID: AB732939.1, and FJ407056.1 for the P6 loop only) to assess the level of similarity.

DNA sequences were processed using Geneious 6.0.5.

The standard nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTN 2.7.0) on the NCBI site was used for comparisons with sequences in GenBank (Morgulis et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2000).

SECTION

SNP genotyping and analysis

PARAGRAPH

All of the desiccated samples, as well as waterlogged samples that either, upon sequencing, produced a sequence matching species within Poaceae or had a total DNA concentration above 1.5 ng μl−1 were genotyped using a Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) assay (LGC Genomics, UK) (He et al., 2014; Livak et al., 1995; Semagn et al., 2014).

This technology allows for bi-allelic scoring of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by utilising two allele-specific primers, each associated with its own fluorescent dye.

The system is able to determine whether the sample is heterozygote or homozygote for either of the two alleles depending on which allele-specific primer is incorporated during the amplification step.

The KASP assay consisted of 100 SNP markers, including seven SNPs associated with specific traits (Hagenblad et al., 2017).

In total, 18 samples (nine desiccated, six waterlogged and three controls) were genotyped.

Samples were genotyped in duplicates with the exception of A21113-2, GB_S-1 and GB_S-2.

PARAGRAPH

As barley is primarily self-fertilizing the SNP genotyping data were treated as haploid in downstream analyses, as suggested in Nordborg et al. (2005), with heterozygotes being treated as missing data during analysis.

SNP calls for duplicates were combined into a consensus genotype for each sample and SNP.

Duplicates where only one sample produced a genotype call was considered to have the genotype of the successful sample.

Genotype calls that differed within a duplicate set were treated as missing data.

The seven functional markers were excluded from population structure analyses.

PARAGRAPH

For population genetic analyses, samples that failed in >15% of the SNPs were removed, as were SNPs that failed in >20% of the ancient samples.

Genotyping data was compared with data from the same loci obtained from 162 individuals from 29 accessions of Fennoscandian 19th century barley landraces genotyped by Forsberg et al. (2015).

Accessions were denoted as “Northern” (with an origin above latitude 65° 0′N), “Mid” (with an origin between latitudes 60 and 65° 0′N) or “Southern” (with an origin below latitude 60° 0′N).

PARAGRAPH

Population structure in the combined datasets was analysed using STRUCTURE (v 2.3.4) (Falush et al., 2003; Pritchard et al., 2000), assuming admixture as a possibility.

A burn-in period of 25,000 iterations was used followed by 50,000 iterations for parameter estimation, with 10 runs for each predetermined cluster number (K) in the interval of 1 to 10.

The output was processed using Structure Harvester Web (v0.6.94 July 2014) (Earl and vonHoldt, 2012) in order to both calculate ΔK (an evaluation quantity based on the second order rate of change of the likelihood function with respect to K (∆K), Evanno et al., 2005) and summarize the individual and population data for each K. CLUMPP (v 1.1.2) (Jakobsson and Rosenberg, 2007) was used to align the cluster analyses with the Greedy algorithm for K < 6 and LargeKGreedy algorithm for K ≥ 6.

The number of populations best describing the data was evaluated based on Structure Harvester ΔK values and CLUMPP's H (the average pairwise similarity between replicated runs at the same value of K).

Distruct (v 1.1) (Rosenberg, 2004) was used for graphical visualization of the results.

PARAGRAPH

PCoA data were generated using GenAlEx 6.503 (Peakall and Smouse, 2006, 2012) and visualized using RStudio (v 0.99.893).

GenAlEx was also used to obtain values for within-accession diversity by calculating Nei's h (1 − ∑p2), as well as between-accession pairwise FST values for the markers passing the above-mentioned criteria of success rate in the ancient samples.

Results

SECTION

Recovery and authenticity of aDNA

PARAGRAPH

The total DNA content of charred and waterlogged samples was found to be between 0.03 and 2.92 ng μl−1 (Table 1).

In order to investigate the DNA quality of the different samples the P6 loop of the chloroplast trnL intron region was amplified using PCR.

Out of the 82 samples tested (46 charred, 19 waterlogged, 9 desiccated, 8 controls), 13 of the charred samples (28.3 %), 13 of the waterlogged (68.4 %) and 9 of the desiccated samples (100 %) resulted in clear PCR products of the expected size.

In addition, one of the controls also amplified a fragment of similar size.

PARAGRAPH

These PCR products, together with an additional six PCRs from charred samples not resulting in visible products, to see if samples without detectable amplification could still produce identifiable nucleotide sequences, and PCRs from seven controls were sequenced.

Thirteen charred, five waterlogged, three desiccated and five controls did not result in useful sequences, i.e. they either did not produce sequences of sufficient quality for analysis, or did not result in sequences with any matches in GenBank (Supplementary Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

Of the sequences that did produce BLAST matches only one of the waterlogged specimens, GB A-2, matched Hordeum in both sequencing reactions (93 and 98 % identity, respectively; Supplementary Table 1) and one, GB A-1, produced sequences that matched Hordeum in one of the sequencing reactions (100% identity).

Another waterlogged sample, T5–1, resulted in BLAST matches of various grasses in the same tribe as Hordeum.

Of the nine desiccated specimens, five produced sequences matching Hordeum (97–100 % identity) but only two of them did so for both sequencing reactions.

Among the charred samples none resulted in sequences matching that expected from barley.

Two out of seven control samples resulted in GenBank hits at least once, one against Linum species and the other against Rhamnus, confirming that the detected barley sequences were unlikely to have resulted from contamination.

SNP genotyping

PARAGRAPH

DNA from six waterlogged and nine desiccated barley samples were, together with three controls, genotyped for 100 SNP markers using KASP.

The charred samples were deemed to be of too poor quality (low DNA concentrations and failure to amplify barley DNA in PCRs) to produce reliable results and were not included in SNP genotyping.

Three of the markers gave genotype calls in the negative plate controls (consisting of ddH2O) and were for that reason removed from further analysis.

Six of the markers failed in all samples.

PARAGRAPH

Only 19 genotype calls could be obtained from the waterlogged samples.

Most calls originated from GB_A-2, which could be successfully analysed in about 11 % of the markers.

GB_A-2 was also the only sample that could be successfully genotyped in both duplicates for two of the SNPs of which one SNP produced identical calls and calls differed in the other SNP.

Among the other samples, success rates ranged from 0 to 2 %, but neither of the remaining two samples analysed in duplicate showed any repeatability of genotype calls.

Due to the low number of successful genotype calls (about 2 % of all waterlogged samples tested) and low repeatability among duplicates, the waterlogged samples were not evaluated further.

PARAGRAPH

Among the desiccated samples, the overall success rate was 54 % with individual rates ranging from 8 to 94 % of the 97 evaluated markers.

The amount of missing data differed noticeably between the different desiccated samples, but also between duplicates of the same sample.

The samples with the lowest levels of missing data were also most likely to produce genotype calls in both duplicates, indicating differences in DNA quantity or quality between individual grains.

Out of the total 394 SNP calls that were genotyped in both duplicates only a single SNP resulted in different genotype calls between duplicates, while 153 SNPs could only be genotyped in one of the duplicates.

SECTION

Functional markers

PARAGRAPH

Three samples (Win.mat_1, 3, 5) were successfully genotyped for the vrs1.a1 allele associated with the six-row trait (Komatsuda et al., 2007).

In addition, all desiccated samples, except Win.mat_4 that could not be genotyped, carried the Int-c.

a allele that contributes to lateral kernel size and is most commonly co-inherited with six-row alleles at Vrs1 (Ramsay et al., 2011).

At Lhcb1 all successfully genotyped samples (Win.mat_1, 3, 5, 6, 7 and Win.pill_1) carried the allele associated with long spike length (Xia et al., 2012).

In addition, all successfully genotyped samples also carried the allele associated with high grain protein content at HvNAM-2 (Cai et al., 2013).

Win.mat_1 was the only sample producing a genotype call for Ppd-H1, and it carried the allele for the nonresponsive phenotype commonly found in barley grown at northern latitudes (Jones et al., 2008).

SECTION

Population genetic analyses

PARAGRAPH

Removal of samples and SNP markers with large amounts of missing data left only five desiccated samples, all originating from the Winstrup grave – henceforth treated as a single accession denoted “Winstrup”, and data from 68 SNPs for population structure analyses and comparison with 19th century samples (Forsberg et al., 2015).

In Structure analysis, ΔK and H values gave the highest support for two (K = 2) or three (K = 3) clusters (Supplementary Fig. 1A and B).

Two clusters primarily separated the northern and three of the mid populations from the remaining accessions which included Winstrup.

Three clusters resulted in the separation of the populations according to latitudinal origin as described in Forsberg et al. (2015), showing the robustness of the results with the more limited number of markers used in this study.

In the model with three clusters Winstrup clustered together with the 19th century accessions NM667, NM671, NM777 and MU52 (Fig. 2) from the southern parts of Sweden and Finland, although MU52 belongs to the latitudinal range that Forsberg et al. (2015) labelled as “Mid”.

The results were further supported by a PCoA that placed Winstrup together with these same accessions along the first and second PCs (Fig. 3A).

Along the third PC, however, Winstrup was distinctly separated from the other southern accessions (Fig. 3B).

PARAGRAPH

Within-accession genetic diversity ranged from 0.009 to 0.102 among all accessions (Supplementary Table 2), with Winstrup having a value of 0.069 and the 19th century southern accessions 0.082 (NM667), 0.084 (NM777) and 0.086 (NM671), respectively.

Pairwise FST values (Supplementary Table 2) comparing Winstrup to the 19th century materials suggested that Winstrup had the shortest genetic distances (FST ≤ 0.196) to the, mostly southern, accessions NM777, NM671, NM618 and NM667.

Winstrup was genetically more distant (FST ≥ 0.312) from the – primarily northern – accessions TR7, NM599, MU13, MU62, TR1, NM669, NM727 and NM633.

Pairwise FST values among the 19th century southern accessions were in the range of 0.079–0.120 (not shown) suggesting that they have shorter genetic distances among themselves than to Winstrup.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Landrace crops have been described as dynamic populations, that is, altering in genetic composition as a result of selection pressures, genetic drift or seed exchange (Camacho Villa et al., 2005).

Although the geographical distribution of genetic diversity in landrace crops has been studied in many species (e.g. Asfaw et al., 2009; Hagenblad et al., 2016; Leino et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2016; Russell et al., 2016), specimens representing different ages will be crucial (e.g. Kistler et al., 2014; Leino et al., 2013; Roullier et al., 2013) for studying temporal changes in the distribution of genetic diversity.

There are, however, problems associated with analysing aDNA from plant specimens.

The endogenous DNA content of the specimens is low, sometimes as little as 1 % of the total DNA content (Carpenter et al., 2013), and damages and fragmentation accumulates in the DNA as it decays (reviewed in Gutaker and Burbano, 2017).

PARAGRAPH

Although there is an ever increasing number of studies of ancient DNA (reviewed in Linderholm, 2016; Shapiro and Hofreiter, 2014), studies on plants have been underrepresented, making up < 5 % of the publications between 1984 and 2016 (Parducci et al., 2017).

This is at least partially a consequence of limited access to suitable materials and it has been suggested that DNA in plant specimen might decay faster than DNA in ancient bones (Weiß et al., 2016).

Archaeobotanical remains can be preserved under different conditions that prevent decomposition, but these can also be expected to affect DNA degradation in different ways (reviewed in Lindahl, 1993; Kistler et al., 2017).

Here we compare primarily Swedish barley materials preserved under three different conditions: desiccated, waterlogged and charred.

SECTION

Suitability of differently preserved materials for genotyping

PARAGRAPH

The desiccated materials were, in agreement with previous studies (Hagenblad et al., 2017; Li et al., 2011; Mascher et al., 2016; Oliveira et al., 2012b), the most promising for genetic analysis and produced the most consistent sequencing results.

In several of the desiccated samples both replicates of amplification and sequencing resulted in Hordeum-specific sequence.

PARAGRAPH

In contrast to the desiccated samples, genetic analyses of the charred samples failed entirely.

In the few cases where PCR amplicons were obtained at all, sequencing revealed that these did not originate from endogenous barley DNA.

Artificial charring experiments of cereal grain have shown that temperatures and heat exposure exceeding 220–240 °C for periods of two or three hours result in grain that resemble well-preserved, archaeological grains in terms of colour and gross morphology (Charles et al., 2015; Fraser et al., 2013).

Braadbaart et al. (2004) propose that grains need to be charred at temperatures above 310 °C to survive long-term degradation processes when buried in soil.

At these temperature conditions, it is unlikely that any DNA-molecules will remain intact (Threadgold and Brown, 2003).

Although the possibility that certain combinations of low-temperature and low-oxygen charring and favourable post-charring conditions could leave charred grains with preserved DNA in the archaeological record should not be ruled out, the absolute majority of all charred grain is unlikely to contain any endogenous DNA.

Recent genotyping experiments of charred grains, both with KASP technology (Lempiäinen-Avci et al., 2018) and NGS (Nistelberger et al., 2016) have proved unfruitful.

PARAGRAPH

The waterlogged samples held somewhat more promise for DNA analyses.

We could retrieve likely authentic (albeit rarely reproducible) sequences from some of the waterlogged samples, where BLAST searches returned Hordeum sequences.

Both of the successfully analysed waterlogged specimens came from the same location where they were found in a wooden barrel together with other plant materials (including Humulus lupulus, Chenopodium sp., Convolvulus arvensis, Fumaria officinalis, Galeopsis sp., Galium album, Persicaria lapathifolia, Polygonum aviculare, Ranunculus repens, Sonchus asper, Stellaria media, Thlaspi arvense, Linum usitatissimum and Brassica nigra), wooden chips and faecal matter from pig.

As the barrel was intact, the materials inside would have been protected from the outside environment.

There is still a risk of DNA leaching between samples, but no DNA from any of the other identified plants from the barrel was detected, suggesting that DNA leaching have not been a major issue in this case.

Uncharred, e.g. waterlogged, samples of cereal grains are in archaeological contexts mostly fragmented, badly corroded or compressed (Jacomet, 2006), and appear to rarely have been evaluated for DNA content (Schlumbaum et al., 2008).

Fernández et al. (2013) failed to retrieve DNA from archaeological waterlogged naked wheat from Spain.

The grains used in this study consisted only of fragments of seed testa, but did still contain endogenous DNA.

The low success rate and low repeatability of the results nevertheless implies that the DNA quality of these materials is low and genetic analysis would require more sensitive methods.

SECTION

Genotyping of plant aDNA

PARAGRAPH

For genotyping of multiple markers of plant aDNA samples, KASP seems to be a promising complement to PCR-based sequencing.

We could see similar patterns of success when comparing materials of different preservation status for KASP as we did with PCR and sequencing; emphasizing the importance of the quality of individual samples for successful analysis.

We did obtain a few genotype calls for waterlogged samples, though not enough to allow further evaluation.

Overall success rate for desiccated samples was 54 %.

For each of the samples, the success rates ranged between 8 and 94 %.

This can be compared to 78 % in 60 to 180 year-old herbarium materials (Lister et al., 2013), and a range of 13 to 96 % in 560–950 year-old desiccated barley grains from the Canary Islands (Hagenblad et al., 2017).

PARAGRAPH

Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has in recent years become the method of choice for aDNA analyses of animal remains (reviewed in Der Sarkissian et al., 2015; Hagelberg et al., 2015).

It is well suited for analysing the short DNA fragments present in old samples (Brown et al., 2014; Gutaker and Burbano, 2017).

This high-throughput method allows for sequencing of all DNA fragments present in a sample.

Plant genome sizes, commonly an order of magnitude, or more, larger than animal genomes, and the amount of repetitive sequence found in plant crop genomes complicates the generation of high-quality reference genomes (e.g. Avni et al., 2017; Mayer et al., 2012; Zimin et al., 2017) and limits the amount of successful assignment of the NGS reads to a possible source of origin.

In addition, the large genome sizes means that in order to obtain datasets from individual samples that can be compared for, for example, population structure analysis massive amounts of sequence data must be secured from each sample.

Alternatively, libraries can be enriched for specific sequences before sequencing by pre-capture (e.g. Mascher et al., 2016), but this technique is work-intensive and does only partly limit the need for deep sequencing.

In KASP, on the other hand, only pre-selected target sites of interest are genotyped ensuring that overlapping datasets are obtained from the samples studied.

In addition, analyses of resulting data is comparatively straight-forward with no need for bioinformatics expertise or massive computational power.

Preservation of geographic structure extending over 200 years

PARAGRAPH

A long-standing question is the time-depth seen in phylogeographical studies of landraces using extant plants or 19th century historical materials (e.g. Hunt et al., 2011; Jones et al., 2011; Oliveira et al., 2012a; Leino et al., 2013; Leino and Hagenblad, 2010).

From a European perspective, the Fennoscandian barley accessions have been shown to form a distinct group and are genetically more homogenous than barley from other parts of Europe (Aslan et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2011).

Our results suggest that the geographic structure discovered in 19th century Fennoscandian barley (Forsberg et al., 2015) had been established already in the 17th century.

The Winstrup accession, belongs to a genetic cluster geographically restricted to Southern Fennoscandia which matches the late 19th century pattern previously described by Forsberg et al. (2015).

Although the accession bearing the highest similarity, in terms of the lowest FST value, to Winstrup was not the one geographically closest to the bishop's burial site in Lund, we can still conclude that the barley used for the bishop's burial was relatively locally sourced.

We can also conclude that the region suffered no major changes to the genetic composition of the barley cultivated over a period of >200 years, a period that saw the swedification of a formerly Danish territory, partitioning reforms and the beginning of the agrarian revolution (Myrdal and Morell, 2011).

Recent studies of ancient desiccated barley from the Canary Islands (Hagenblad et al., 2017) and Near East (Mascher et al., 2016) suggest that locally adapted crops can remain relatively unchanged in restricted geographical areas for very long time periods.

More data from geographically distant specimens and older specimens are needed to see whether the temporal genetic stability observed here extends over larger areas of Fennoscandia.

Both PC3 and pairwise FST comparisons of the Winstrup barley and the 19th century southern materials show some differentiation between the two, indicating a presence of a temporal genetic change.

Whether this change results from small scale seed trade, genetic drift or selection is at this stage not possible to determine.

PARAGRAPH

When investigating local adaptation in Fennoscandian accessions of barley Aslan et al. (2015) found that certain SNPs were associated with climate parameters such as the length of the growth season (proportion of days with temperature above 5 °C) and regional yearly precipitation.

One of the SNPs associated with length of the growth season (SNP 11_20379) was successfully genotyped in this study.

The genotype found in Winstrup barleys was in Aslan et al. (2015) more common among, but not exclusive to, southern accessions and MU52, all from the region with a longer growth season.

We are currently undertaking next-generation sequencing of the Winstrup barley to perform a more detailed genetic characterization of this 17th century barley and to identify similarities and differences with crops from the subsequent centuries.

Conclusion

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, desiccated plant materials provided the highest genotyping success rates of the materials analysed here, in agreement with previous studies.

The waterlogged samples had much lower success rates, but nonetheless seemed promising.

In cases where no desiccated grains can be found, waterlogged grains could be an alternative for aDNA studies if the most sensitive analysis methods are applied.

As for the charred samples, we add to the growing list of studies failing to detect endogenous DNA.

Further, our results suggest that the genetic composition of barley grown in southern Sweden changed very little from late 17th to late 19th century.

During those 200 years the region underwent repeated crop failures and lack of seed grain (Dribe et al., 2015), introduction of improved cultivars and technical developments including fertilizers and mechanization of sowing and harvest (Myrdal and Morell, 2011).

Despite these circumstances the locally adapted barley seem to have been competitive enough to remain the seed of choice for farmers in southern Sweden.
