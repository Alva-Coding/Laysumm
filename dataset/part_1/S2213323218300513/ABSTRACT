ABSTRACT

TITLE

Successful use of pure cannabidiol for the treatment of super-refractory status epilepticus

PARAGRAPH

We present the case of a child with long-standing, super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) who manifested prompt and complete resolution of SRSE upon exposure to pure cannabidiol.

SRSE emerged in the context of remote suspected encephalitis with previously well-controlled epilepsy.

We discuss the extent to which response may be specifically attributed to cannabidiol, with consideration and discussion of multiple potential drugâ€“drug interactions.

Based on this case, we propose that adjunctive cannabidiol be considered in the treatment of SRSE.
