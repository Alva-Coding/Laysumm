TITLE

A preliminary survey on hand grip and hand-tool morphometrics in three different stone tools

PARAGRAPH

Technology has influenced our anatomical and cognitive capacities, and human hand is functionally specialized for manipulation.

In terms of cognition, tools are integrated into the body scheme when handled.

Stone tools can supply information on the evolution of this reciprocal relationship.

In this survey, we investigate basic patterns associated with hand-tool morphometrics.

Results on three different tool types suggest that tool length influences the grasping pattern more than hand dimensions.

Hand-tool morphometrics can provide information to support ergonomic and cognitive perspectives in technological extension and cognitive archaeology.
