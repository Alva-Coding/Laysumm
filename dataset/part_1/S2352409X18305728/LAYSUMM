TITLE

Ceramic production in prehistoric northwest China: Preliminary findings of new analyses of old material from the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, Stockholm

PARAGRAPH

The Neolithic painted pottery of northwest China is well-known for its striking beauty and high quality, but little is known about the potters themselves.

Similarly, the communities behind the less striking Bronze Age wares are not well understood.

Using collections of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities this paper shows how a combination of scientific techniques can be used to throw light on the practices of ceramic making.

In particular, the paper reconstructs how past potters coped with the technical challenges local raw materials posed, and how they maintained certain techniques over time, while adapting others to changing needs and expectations.
