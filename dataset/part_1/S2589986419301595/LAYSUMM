TITLE

Propensity for seizure-related cortical laminar necrosis in hepatic encephalopathy

PARAGRAPH

Laminar necrosis of the cerebral cortex, recognisable by its pattern on MRI scans, sometimes results from sustained epileptic discharges.

Metabolic consequences of liver failure may increase the risk of this irreversible cortical damage.

We present three patients with hepatic encephalopathy who developed cortical laminar necrosis after prolonged focal seizure activity.

Brain metabolism of ammonia may have indirectly contributed to neuronal death.

Early identification and treatment of seizures in combination with ammonia-lowering therapy could be protective in this situation.
