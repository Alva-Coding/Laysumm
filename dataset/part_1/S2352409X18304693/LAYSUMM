TITLE

Characterization of building materials by means of spectral remote sensing: The example of Carcassonne's defensive wall (Aude, France)

PARAGRAPH

Geological and archaeological analysis of stone masonries in standing structures helps reveal information about use of natural resources, organization of labour and supplies on the construction site.

An interdisciplinary approach was applied for the study of building materials in distinct construction phases of the inner defensive wall in the fortified citadel of Carcassonne (Aude, France).

Stratigraphic analysis of the architecture, short-range spectral remote sensing (hyperspectral imaging, portable Near Infrared - NIR) and portable ED-XRF measurements (Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence spectroscopy) were combined to classify sandstone elements and delineate raw materials varieties and their use or re-use through time.
