TITLE

Divide-and-conquer framework for image restoration and enhancement

PARAGRAPH

We develop a new divide-and-conquer framework for improving visual quality of degraded images, and make use of different image contents and their characteristics for image restoration and enhancement.

Our framework is efficiently implemented, and is simply extended to other algorithms for promoting performances.

1) Dividing: we decompose an image into different components by considering their visual importance and exploiting their differences.

2) Processing: we establish different models for image subspace restoration and enhancement, and use existing methods to tackle them respectively.

3) Integrating: we employ an effective fusion scheme to integrate post-processed subspaces for final image.
