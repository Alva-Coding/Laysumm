TITLE

No effect of electrical transcranial direct current stimulation adjunct treatment for epilepsia partialis continua in POLG disease

PARAGRAPH

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive form of brain stimulation, was used to treat muscle jerks in the upper limbs caused by epilepsy in a patient with mitochondrial disease.

The stimulation was administered via two electrodes on the scalp for five days and muscle jerks and epileptic activity spikes were counted and compared from before to after stimulation treatment.

Unfortunately, the treatment was not effective in reducing muscle jerks in the arms and shoulders.

This study highlights that more data is needed to determine if and under which conditions the tDCS treatment is effective.
