TITLE

Integrated characterization of ancient burial mounds using ERT and limited drillings at the Hepu Han Tombs, in coastal area of Southern China

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepu County is located on the south coast of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in southern China, bordering the Beibu Gulf (Fig. 1).

The name of “Hepu” (合浦) means intersection of rivers and sea in Chinese, based on the local geographical features, as the North-South Nanliu River flows into the Beibu Gulf in the region.

In the year 111 BCE, the Hepu district was conquered by the Emperor Che Liu of Han Empire, and soon after became a big city, within the area ten times larger than today.

This region also became an important international trade port and a starting point of Maritime Silk Road, spreading strong and persistent cultural influence to neighboring countries from ancient China, and connecting China with African, European and other Asian countries in national migration, religious communication, political, trade, technical and cultural exchanges, and so on in the historical period.

PARAGRAPH

Hepu Han Tombs, the distribution boundary of which is marked with blue line in Fig. 1 surrounding Hepu County, are the historic outcome of the implementation of centralized rule and new administrative system, the commandery-district system carried out away from the central government, by the Han Empire (Xiong, 2014).

Furthermore, 1056 mounds are scattered over a total area of 68 km2 in the region, and can easily be identified on the surface (Xiong, 2015).

In the past 60 years, a series of archaeological surveys were performed without any geophysical work.

Over 1200 tombs have been excavated and it is estimated that almost 10,000 ancient tombs are still waiting to be discovered.

In addition, most of the excavated tombs can date back to the Han dynasty (202 BCE–220 CE), while others are from subsequent historical periods, e.g. Three Kingdoms, Jin Dynasty and Southern Dynasties periods (220–589 CE).

PARAGRAPH

The extensive tombs at Hepu represent one of the best-preserved ancient tomb complexes of the Han dynasty in China.

According to the detailed information from previous archaeological excavation surveys, the scales, orientations, and burial architectures of the ancient tombs are not exactly same: the scales range from 2 × 1 × 1 m to 15 × 10 × 3 m, while the lengths of tomb passages range from 6 m to 40 m, which mainly depends on the social status of the tomb owner and universal architectural style during the building period.

Fig. 2 displays four typical planar structures of burial mounds with a historical evolution in the Han Dynasty: the structure of wooden-chambered tombs in the upper left figure was replaced by the two structures in the lower left since Mid-term of Western Dynasty (about 87 BCE), and with the emergence of brick-chambered tombs, until the structure of brick-chambered dominated the construction style in Eastern Han Dynasty.

An example photo from an excavated well-preserved brick-chambered tomb found in 1987, with a tomb passage, a front chamber, a back chamber, and two symmetrical side rooms, is also provided in Fig. 2.

PARAGRAPH

Following the Han burial customs, a tomb should be ideally decorated as a home for the dead person, sharing the same case when he lived, so that he could continue the next life in another world.

Buried funerary objects are always supposed to imply the tomb-owner's daily life and to reveal his/her wealth and status when alive.

Besides common pottery, bronze, iron, lacquer, gold and silver wares, and local pearls were unearthed, there were other lots of beautiful exotic cultural relics, such as glass from Mediterranean area, garnet from India and Sri Lanka, amber from Roman Empire or Myanmar, turquoise from Persia, agate and perfume from Southeast Asia, and so on (e.g. Liu et al., 2013; Dong et al., 2014; Xiong, 2015).

Obviously, abundant unearthed funerary objects reveal many multi-cultural elements, which highlight the region wasn't strongly influenced only from Central Plains of China during the period, but also communicated with other parts of Asia and Mediterranean area (Hao and Lu, 1731).

PARAGRAPH

The study of Hepu Han Tombs can restore the local history, provide the possible to investigate the burial customs and the culture in the Han Dynasty, and are also benefit to understand the communications along the Maritime Silk Road.

In the framework of the bilateral cooperation project between Zhejiang University and Guangxi Institute of Cultural Relics Protection and Archaeology, high-resolution geophysical and traditional archaeological drilling explorations were performed within the area of two adjacent ancient mounds with different dimensions at the Jinjiling Site of Hepu Han Tombs in 2016 (see the location in Fig. 1).

In this work, series of irregular 2-D ERT profiles acquired on the larger mound were combined into a “Pseudo 3-D” volume, to emphasize the location and lateral variations within the data volume, and the possibilities and limitations of 3-D ERT in approaching the challenging geophysical problem of exploring a mound were also investigated through iso-resistivity surfaces.

Limited drillings were subsequently performed by archaeological team, to calibrate the ERT results.

The aim was to demonstrate an integrated characterization of ancient burial mounds by the geophysical group in co-operation with the archaeological experts can improve our knowledge on the un-excavated mounds, and allow detailed pre-excavation plan at the Hepu Han Tombs.

Electrical resistivity tomography in archaeology

PARAGRAPH

Geophysical methods have proven to be reliable and widely used in archaeology during the last several decades, as they can identify and characterize buried structures and foundations with efficient and non-destructive manners, by virtues of evaluating their main geometric and geophysical parameters based on subsurface variations in physical properties between archaeological targets and surrounding soils (e.g. Weymouth, 1986; Aubry et al., 2001; Larson et al., 2003; Gaffney, 2008).

The resistivity survey method is considered as one of the oldest and most commonly used archaeological prospecting methods (Loke et al., 2013), as it can provide the information of subsurface resistivity distributions, also involved geometry of subsurface heterogeneities (Atkinson, 1963; Hesse et al., 1986; Papadopoulos et al., 2006).

Remarkable electrical resistivity features are usually associated with important archaeological remains, e.g. caves, walls, or foundations (Dogan and Papamarinopoulos, 2003; Bavusi et al., 2009; Tsourlos and Tsokas, 2011), while moisture content can significantly affect the resistivity contrasts.

PARAGRAPH

The conventional resistivity meter carried out in profiling surveys typically runs with four electrodes connected via separate cables, while advances in instruments and softwares allow acquiring resistivity value in a ‘tomographic’ manner, i.e. multi-electrodes are connected to the resistivity meter via a multi-core cable, and an internal switching circuitry controlled by a programmable microprocessor can automatically selects the appropriate 4 electrodes for each measurement, which enables almost any array configuration to be used with different spacings, and subsequently building up a 2-D resistivity pseudo-section along a measuring line (Loke, 2001).

Since commercial multi-electrode systems appeared in the late 1980s (Griffiths et al., 1990), together with the development of fast and stable data inversion algorithms (deGroot-Hedlin and Constable, 1990; Loke and Barker, 1996), the technique, named electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), has become widely used and furnishes detailed 2D/3D models of electrical resistivity distribution of the subsurface both vertically and laterally.

PARAGRAPH

Successful archaeological applications of ERT include the identification of buried walls, ditches, passageways, foundations, and anthropogenic or natural cavities (e.g. Cardarelli and Di Filippo, 2009; Berge and Drahor, 2011; Orfanos and Apostolopoulos, 2011; Cozzolino et al., 2014), the characterization of mounds and tumuli (Griffiths and Barker, 1994; Tonkov, 1996; Morelli et al., 2004; Papadopoulos et al., 2010; Tsourlos et al., 2014); the structural assessment of historical buildings (e.g. Tsokas et al., 2008; Mol and Preston, 2010; Zeid et al., 2010; Capizzi et al., 2012), and the improved understanding of paleo-geographic/geologic constraints on archaeological sites (e.g. Similox-Tohon et al., 2006; Negri et al., 2008; Ercoli et al., 2012; Bottari et al., 2017; Finkler et al., 2018).

The ERT conducted in aquatic environments has also been reported, for example, a marine ERT survey was carried out over a submerged beach to detect ship wreck (Passaro, 2010).

PARAGRAPH

Archaeological geophysicists have appreciated that a better understanding of the spatial extent of targets is obtained from a grid, rather than a single 2-D profile.

A 3-D resistivity survey and interpretation model can give the most accurate results of potential archaeological targets in terms of extension, shape, and depth.

However, a complete 3-D survey requires placing of multi-electrodes in the form of a 3-D grid with measurements in different directions (i.e. x-direction, y-direction, and diagonal direction), so the strategy is very time-consuming and limited by physical constraints in some cases.

Although several 3-D inversion algorithms have been proposed for many years (e.g. Park and Van, 1991; Loke and Barker, 1996; Tsourlos and Ogilvy, 1999), 3-D full ERT surveys are rarely documented in archaeology (Zhao et al., 2013).

PARAGRAPH

As a matter of fact, a more cost-effective and routinely strategy is usually based on “pseudo 3-D” volumes by merging independent adjacent interesting 2-D resistivity models, e.g. acquired along parallel profiles (Negri et al., 2008; Nuzzo et al., 2009; Argote-Espino et al., 2016) or radial profiles (Tsourlos et al., 2014), so the “2.5-D” expression seems to be more appropriate.

Particularly, if a conventional regular grid is subject to the specific working conditions, an innovative approach has been designed for the use of L-shaped, C-shaped or “loop” electrode arrangements (e.g. Fischanger et al., 2007; Santarato et al., 2011; Argote-Espino et al., 2013; Chávez et al., 2015; Tejero-Andrade et al., 2015).

Furthermore, the common way to display 3-D resistivity data volume is the depth slice technique, in which resistivity values are extracted and mapped at a certain depth (e.g. Tonkov, 1996; Drahor et al., 2008; Papadopoulos et al., 2010; Berge and Drahor, 2011).

However, depth slice may not be the best visualization and analysis technique in the case of great topography/subsurface complexity.

Iso-surfaces are acknowledged as an excellent representation of modern 3D geophysical datasets analysis and visualization, as they reduce the size of the data, allowing the identification of each anomaly.

Accordingly, iso-resistivity surfaces can accelerate the interpretation by implementing semi-automatic procedures and obviously advance the overall quality and efficiency of ERT data interpretation (Abu-Zeid et al., 2006; Drahor et al., 2008; Zeid et al., 2010; Cozzolino et al., 2014).

Study area

PARAGRAPH

The Hepu Han Tombs are distributed in the Hepu Basin, a small faulted sedimentary basin developed in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, located in the south of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Most of the Hepu Basin, except for the southeast, is in a coastal environment.

When the marine transgression took place during the late ice period of about 5000–6000 years ago, the coastline went deeper into the mainland than it is now, and the Nanliu River estuary retreated to the central Hepu Basin, where numerous rock islands spreads in the shallow bay (Yan and Zhang, 1994).

Since the Mid-Holocene (about 3000 years ago), land and sea sediments siltation and Nanliu River estuary's movement to the sea continuously, have formed the distribution of land and sea status, also with the formation of lagoons.

At present, Quaternary unconsolidated sediments cover 67% of the total area, and exposed old strata are mainly developed in the Paleozoic, while the rare strata of Mesozoic are Upper Cretaceous continental facies.

PARAGRAPH

Our geophysical and traditional archaeological drilling explorations were performed above two adjacent ancient mounds at the Jinjiling Site, in the north of Hepu Han Tombs, which is located in low-lying alluvial plain, seriously affected by the flood in the historical periods.

The local strata are mainly composed of granite and basalt basement, Laterite layer, and Quaternary sediments.

Moreover, the vegetations' flourish in the region, mainly including plantations, secondary forests and grass.

PARAGRAPH

The detected two ancient mounds are named as M-1 and M-20 respectively (Fig. 3).

M-20 is a smaller one, but previously detected by exhaustive archaeological drillings, which means the general location, shape and dimension of the mound are available, while M-1 is the largest mound one at Jinjiling Site, without any priori archaeological evidence.

Besides, the maximum diameter of the remaining mound of M-1 on the surface is about 73 m, while the maximum height is about 8.5 m. From the photographs of Fig. 3, we can see that the surface conditions are very complicated: numerous poles, vegetations, and modern tombs brought us great difficulties during the geophysical project planning and data acquisition in this area.

In addition, a big robbing hole can also be found just above M-1, which means the chamber of the tomb may have been severely damaged.

Data acquisition and data processing

PARAGRAPH

A Real Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) survey, using Trimble 5800, was carried out to obtain high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) with latitude/longitude and elevation accuracies in 0.1 cm and less than 1 cm respectively.

A Geopen E60D resistivity-meter system was used to acquire the ERT data, which was a fast multi-channel acquisition system with distributed cable connection and multi-electrode switching capability: a survey of multiples of 8 channels in one single 2-D profile could be performed, forming a pseudo-section of the ground in terms of apparent electrical resistivity.

Moreover, traditional archaeological drilling explorations were performed with Luoyang Spade, a typical drilling tool to acquire the detailed information of subsurface by means of drilling cores with a few centimeters in diameter, and several meters (even more than 10 m) in depth.

This tool was originally invented and widely used by tomb robbers, but it has become one of the most useful field archaeological tools in the past century in China.

PARAGRAPH

As the general location, shape and dimension of M-20 were available, three ERT profiles were laid out here to test ERT characterization in the Jinjiling site firstly (Fig. 4): L3 was acquired along the main orientation of the burial mound (chamber and tomb passage), L4 and L5 were perpendicular to L3, while L4 traversed the chamber, and L5 traversed the tomb passage.

Considering required spatial coverage, detection resolution, steep sections of the mound, complicated surface environment and the local archeologists' suggestions, nine ERT profiles with two main directions, i.e. W-E and S-N, were laid out above the M-1 (Fig. 4).

Wenner-Schlumberger electrode configuration, a good trade-off between accuracy in noisy surface environment and acquisition time for resistivity surveys, was adopted in the study, with an electrode spacing of 1 m.

According to the specific surface environment, we laid out the ERT profiles with different lengths (Table 1).

In addition, because of the very-unsatisfactory coupling between electrode and unconsolidated soil, we irrigated every electrode with brine after inserting the electrode into the ground.

PARAGRAPH

An accurate topographic correction was also applied with the topographic data acquired with RTK-GPS survey, taking into account the complicated terrain.

And the subsurface distribution of 2-D true resistivity models was subsequently calculated by inversion routine with the software RES2DINV, based on the smoothness constrained least-squares method (Loke and Barker, 1996).

The Root-Mean-Squared (RMS) error was a measurement of the differences between the calculated and measured resistivity values, and the iteration wouldn't stop until getting an acceptable converging state between the calculated and measured data.

In our study five iterations were used.

In addition, all the resistivity contour lines were mapped at logarithmic intervals.

Fig. 5 shows a comparison example of 2-D ERT inversion model based on the data without/with topographic correction: the model incorporating the topography exhibits a better image characterization obviously.

PARAGRAPH

Series of irregular 2-D ERT profiles acquired above M-1 were combined into a “Pseudo 3-D” volume with Kriging interpolation to map the potential target in terms of extension and shape, and iso-resistivity surfaces were also calculated to emphasize lateral variations and general geometry of the structural details of the burial mound.

After ERT surveys, besides two drillings cores performed at the peaks of M-20 and M-1 (i.e. Drillings I and II marked in Fig. 4) to validate the accuracy of ERT results, several other limited drillings were also performed around ERT abnormal characterizations of M-1, to calibrate the ERT results, and to identify and characterize the border of the burial mound intuitively and visually.

Results and discussions

SECTION

2-D ERT results

PARAGRAPH

Fig. 6 shows the inversion results of 2-D ERT profiles acquired above M-20.

A high resistivity value is well distinguished from the less homogeneous background, associated with the potential target, involving the burial mound is more resistive than the surrounding soils.

Furthermore, we observe a very-high electrical resistivity abnormal is located below 5 m depth with a dimension of 12 × 5 m, and it can be associated with the chamber (Fig. 6a).

The electrical resistivity response from the tomb passage is mixed with the response from the chamber, while it ends at about 28 m on the left, interrupted with the left electrical resistivity abnormal, associated with the possible natural sediments, as it isn't in the range of the mound.

In addition, high electrical resistivity responses from the chamber and the tomb passage can also be readily observed from Profiles 4 and 5 (Fig. 6b and c).

PARAGRAPH

Following the ERT tests above M-20, Fig. 7 shows three inversion examples of 2-D ERT profiles acquired above M-1.

From these pictures we can see that there are similar electrical resistivity characteristics between the results and the former ones: Profiles 6 and 8 achieve the same significant resistivity anomalies with Profile 3, implying that the S-N direction is the main orientation of the burial mound (chamber and tomb passage).

However, the electrical resistivity of the bottom layer of Profile 6 is very high, and we infer that this profile is located just above the burial mound, and the inversion result of the potential target layer is difficult to converge, resulting in deeper layer un-recognition.

From Fig. 7b, we can discern an electrical resistivity abnormal shape buried in 5 m depth, similar to the shape of burial mound: a tomb passage, a front chamber and a back chamber, as marked with dotted lines.

A clearer boundary characterization for the burial mound demonstrates that Profile 8 is located a little offset to the center location of the mound compared to the imaging result of Profile 6.

In addition, we should pay attention that the high electrical resistivity abnormal between 66 m–70 m, corresponds the location of a known robbing hole, which seems totally isolated with the burial mound.

After comparing the locations between Profile 10 and Profiles 6 and 8, we find that Profile 10 traverses the back chamber, and a high electrical resistivity value can also be recognized in the central part of the section, associated with the potential target.

SECTION

Pseudo 3-D ERT results

PARAGRAPH

In order to image the shape and geometry of the potential archaeological structure, all the 2-D inversion results were combined into a “Pseudo 3-D volume”.

And iso-resistivity surfaces, with a threshold value of the maximum resistivity 70%, were also calculated from the pseudo 3-D volume (Fig. 8), to emphasize the location and spatial extent of the target based on resistivity value analysis on the data-sets.

However, prior to the following interpretations, we should emphasize that there are obvious artificial errors, marked with orange ellipsis, which are mainly caused by interpolation from sparse data.

Besides, the general shape of the burial tomb can be recognized, although mixed with the high electrical resistivity value, caused by the robbing hole.

The tomb passage, front chamber and back chamber are also marked with pink lines, together with short pink dotted lines, maybe associated with a possible extension of the tomb passage.

SECTION

Archaeological drillings

PARAGRAPH

After ERT surveys, Drillings I and II drillings were performed at the peaks of M-20 and M-1 respectively to investigate the soil character of the mound to support the correct interpretations of ERT.

The drilling cores can yield a stratigraphic succession made up of anthropogenic and primary soils, shown in Fig. 9, while Tables 2 and 3 reveal the detailed descriptions for Drillings I and II respectively.

The results show a general consistency for the depth of potential archaeological features between ERT surveys and archaeological drillings.

PARAGRAPH

Moreover, following the 3-D ERT result, limited drillings were also performed above M-1, easily identifying and characterizing the border of burial mound, which were sketched with white rope in the field site by the archaeological team (Fig. 10a and b).

Considering the 2-D/3-D ERT results and limited archaeological drillings synthetically, a detailed interpretation model can be provided (Fig. 10c), i.e. a tomb passage, a front chamber, and a back chamber, the dimensions of which are also specified in the figure.

After careful calibration, we also overlapped the interpretation result on ERT data acquisition grids (Fig. 10d).

PARAGRAPH

The depths of the burial primary soil layer at the peak of M-20 and M-1 are 6.7 m and 8.7 m respectively, also supporting the 2-D ERT results (Figs. 6 and 7).

In addition, the results have shown a general consistency between the ERT surveys and traditional archaeological drilling explorations for M-1, a detailed interpretation model can be further provided, which could improve our knowledge on the un-excavated mound significantly, and allow detailed pre-excavation plan.

It's always difficult to obtain the age for an un-excavated mound, but we can know M-1 was built before the Mid-term of Western Han Dynasty according to its construction style, associated with the historical evolution of the structure of ancient burial tombs in Hepu Han Tombs introduced previously.

SECTION

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

Tombs may contain important findings of great historical and economical values and they have great archaeological significance, while the characterization of burial mounds is an especially challenging geophysical problem, due to uneven topographical terrain, complicated surface environment, and complex distributions of the burial archaeological features.

However, our study reveals a reliable and satisfactory result: the high-quality 2-D ERT images allow a detailed and quantitative interpretation prior to archaeological drillings, and pseudo 3-D iso-resistivity analysis also reveals the general geometry of M-1.

But we have to recognize that obvious artificial errors, caused by interpolation from sparse data, affect the 3-D interpretation seriously.

Although dense data coverage can enhance the modeling results and increase the success of the interpretation, complicated surface environments are always challenging for data acquisition.

Anyway, our study demonstrates that the integrated approaches of ERT surveys and limited drillings are suitable and effective to characterize the burial tomb.
