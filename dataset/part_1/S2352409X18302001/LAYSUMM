TITLE

Archaeomagnetic evidence of pre-Hispanic origin of Mezcal

PARAGRAPH

The pre-Hispanic evidence of distilled beverages still remains highly controversial in Mesoamerica.

The distillation procedure of Tequila involves only the blue agave (tequiliana weber), while any type of agave may be used to produce Mezcal.

The origin of mezcal is a matter of debate and it is still unclear whether distilled drinks were produced in Mexico before the Spaniards arrival.

A detailed archaeomagnetic study of several ovens where cooked maguey remains were discovered in Central Mexico, revealed that the alcohol distillation was known in Mesoamerica long before the arrival of Europeans, for at least 25 centuries.
