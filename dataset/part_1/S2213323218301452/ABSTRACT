ABSTRACT

TITLE

Continuous ictal discharges with high frequency oscillations confined to the non-sclerotic hippocampus in an epileptic patient with radiation-induced cavernoma in the lateral temporal lobe

PARAGRAPH

Intraoperative electrocorticography recording is recommended for treating cavernoma-related epilepsy.

However, interictal paroxysmal epileptiform activity is generally able to be recorded, but is not always identical to the epileptogenic zone.

PARAGRAPH

We surgically treated a 15-year-old girl with drug-resistant epilepsy associated with radiation-induced cavernoma in the right lateral temporal lobe.

Electrocorticography revealed paroxysmal activities in the cortex around the cavernoma.

Additionally, continuous subclinical “ictal” discharges with high-frequency oscillations confined to the histologically non-sclerotic hippocampus were recorded.

Following additional hippocampectomy, a good seizure outcome was obtained.

PARAGRAPH

Intraoperative electrocorticography and high-frequency oscillation analysis revealed high epileptogenicity in the non-sclerotic hippocampus of this patient.
