TITLE

Continuous ictal discharges with high frequency oscillations confined to the non-sclerotic hippocampus in an epileptic patient with radiation-induced cavernoma in the lateral temporal lobe

PARAGRAPH

Intraoperative electrocorticography (iECoG) recording is recommended for treating cavernoma related epilepsy.

However, only “interictal” paroxysmal activities are generally recordable.

We surgically treated a 15-year-old girl with drug-resistant epilepsy associated with radiation-induced cavernoma in the right lateral temporal lobe.

iECoG revealed paroxysmal activities in the cortex around the cavernoma.

Additionally, continuous subclinical “ictal” discharges with high-frequency oscillations (HFO), confined to the histologically non-sclerotic hippocampus, were recorded.

iECoG and HFO analysis revealed high epileptogenicity in the non-sclerotic hippocampus of this patient.
