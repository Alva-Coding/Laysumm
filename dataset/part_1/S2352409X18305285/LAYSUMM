TITLE

The spatiotemporal distribution of Late Viking Age Swedish runestones: A reflection of the Christianisation process and its speed

PARAGRAPH

The Late Viking Age Swedish runestones have long been assumed to be Christian monuments, with supposedly older runestones appearing in early Christianised regions.

We used geostatistical methods to analyse the spatial relationships between runestone age and independent indicators of Christianisation to test whether the obtained patterns mirror the timing of the Christianisation process.

Our results confirm that the runestones are suitable indicators of Christianisation: the runestones are significantly older close to other indicators of early Christianisation.

Runestone age allows for the mapping of the spread of Christianity in Sweden, and we can identify seven distinct runestone-age regions.
