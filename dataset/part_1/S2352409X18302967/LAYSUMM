TITLE

Migration or landscape fragmentation in Early Medieval eastern France? A case study from Niedernai

PARAGRAPH

The 5th century is traditionally linked to social and political turmoil, large-scale migration processes and population exchange caused by the so-called ‘Fall of Rome’.

However, these hypotheses have recently been challenged by archaeologists: Long-range migration can easily be replaced by small-scale mobility that leads to changing land-use strategies, material distribution networks and closer spheres of individual’s activity.

The site catchment of a 5th and 6th century necropolis at Niedernai (Upper Rhine Valley, eastern France) was selected to conduct spatial analyses and thus estimate and interconnect graveyard and settlement distribution in a consistently utilized environment.
