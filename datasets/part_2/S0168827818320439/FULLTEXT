TITLE

The intensive care unit course and outcome in acute-on-chronic liver failure are comparable to other populations

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a recently defined clinical entity characterized by acute deterioration of compensated or stable decompensated cirrhosis associated with organ failure and a high 28-day mortality.1–6

ACLF as an entity differs in its clinical presentation and prognosis from alcoholic hepatitis and decompensated cirrhosis without organ failure.4,7

Also, the inflammatory response is more pronounced in ACLF compared to compensated or decompensated cirrhosis with preserved organ function.4

White blood cell counts, plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are higher in patients with ACLF than in cirrhotic patients without ACLF.8–10

This excessive inflammatory response may be an important contributing factor in the development of organ failure and immune exhaustion which may predispose to the development of new infections especially in hospitalized individuals.1,11

PARAGRAPH

Cirrhotic patients with organ failure admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) have a high ICU and hospital mortality, ranging from 36 to 89%, depending on the type and number of organ failures.1,12–15

These high mortality rates commonly impact on the decision not to admit these patients to the ICU, especially when not regarded eligible candidates for a liver transplant (LT).

However, it is still unknown whether the outcome of ACLF is in fact inferior, when compared to the outcome of patients without chronic liver disease admitted to the ICU with organ failure.

PARAGRAPH

We hypothesized that patients with ACLF, due to an altered host immune response and underlying cirrhosis, will have inferior outcomes when compared to an ICU population with organ failure without chronic liver disease.

To test this hypothesis, we compared the clinical ICU course and outcome of patients with ACLF to patients without chronic liver disease, but with comparable baseline characteristics, including demographics, presence of comorbidities and clinical parameters of illness severity.

As patients with ACLF share similar clinical and biochemical characteristics with septic patients,8,16 we first compared the clinical ICU outcome of patients with ACLF to a non-ACLF mixed medical and surgical ICU population with a diagnosis of sepsis upon admission to the ICU.

Secondly, as sepsis is also a frequent precipitating factor in ACLF,1,3,4,10 potentially introducing bias, we subsequently compared the clinical ICU course and outcome of patients with ACLF to medical ICU patients suffering from non-hepatic organ failure, again matched for baseline characteristics and severity of illness scores, but also for diagnosis of sepsis on admission.

Materials and methods

SECTION

Patient population

PARAGRAPH

To compare the ICU outcome of patients with ACLF to other ICU patients with similar illness severity, we performed a post hoc secondary analysis of a large clinical database from the prospective, multicenter EPaNIC trial, which is a randomized controlled trial of heterogenous adult ICU patients comparing early vs. late administration of parenteral nutrition to supplement insufficient enteral nutrition.17

The design and results of the EPaNIC trial have been published.17

Patients were admitted between August 2007 and November 2010 to a tertiary university hospital with LT facilities.

From the original patient population (n = 4,640), 133 patients were identified with cirrhosis of whom 71 fulfilled the CANONIC criteria for ACLF.4

Cirrhosis was diagnosed based on clinical, biochemical and ultrasonography or histological data.

Acute decompensation was defined as development of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, overt ascites, new onset of hepatic encephalopathy and/or bacterial infection.

Organ failure in the ACLF group was diagnosed using the chronic liver failure sequential organ failure assessment (CLIF-SOFA) score, a modified SOFA score for critically ill cirrhotic patients, recently developed in a multicenter study.4

PARAGRAPH

First, we performed a propensity scored selection of the EPaNIC database, matching for baseline characteristics and severity of illness, in a subgroup of mixed surgical and medical patients with sepsis on admission, but without ACLF or chronic liver disease (Table 1).

Propensity scores were obtained by logistic regression, with one-to-one nearest neighbor matching without replacement.18

For this matching, the following baseline characteristics were used: gender, age, body mass index, nutritional risk score, pre-admission dialysis, malignancy, diabetes, APACHE II score on admission, and randomization to early or late parenteral nutrition.

This subgroup is further referred to as “septic ICU patients”.

In a subset of 100 patients (50 ACLF and 50 septic ICU patients), baseline cytokine concentrations were determined in serum samples collected on day 1 following ICU admission (Table S1 for patient characteristics).

Secondly, because 70% of the ACLF population also suffered from sepsis upon ICU admission, an additional comparator group was analyzed to exclude possible bias.

For this analysis, we selected 71 patients from the EPaNIC study admitted to the medical ICU matched to the ACLF patient group for “sepsis on admission” and the other baseline risk factors described above with use of propensity scores.

This subgroup is further referred to as “medical ICU patients”.

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Data are presented as mean with standard deviation or median with interquartile ranges.

Group comparisons were performed using parametric Student’s t test or Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis or Pearson’s Chi-squared testing where appropriate using SSPS version 24 (IBM, Hong Kong China).

Multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to investigate parameters with the time-to-alive ICU discharge as the dependent variable.

Data for patients who died were censored.

Statistical analyses were performed using JMP® version 12 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).

Two-sided p value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.

SECTION

Cytokine measurements

PARAGRAPH

Meso Scale Discovery V-plex assays (Gaithersburg, MD) were used to determine plasma cytokine (INF-γ, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α) and chemokine (CCL-2, CCL-3 and CCL-13) levels.

All measurements were performed in duplicate according to manufacturers’ instructions.

Results

SECTION

Clinical ICU outcome of patients with ACLF and non-ACLF patients with comparable baseline risk factors

PARAGRAPH

Of the 71 patients diagnosed with ACLF, 8 (11%) had ACLF grade 1, 34 (48%) had ACLF grade 2 and 29 (41%) had ACLF grade 3 upon ICU admission.

Of the 29 patients with ACLF grade 3, 14 patients had 3, 10 patients had 4, 4 patients had 5 and 1 patient had 6 failing organs.

Median (IQR) serum albumin, sodium and international normalized ratio on admission were respectively 27.2 (24.4–30.8) g/L, 136 (132.5–139.3) mmol/L and 1.7 (1.4–2.1).

Fifty (70%) patients with ACLF were diagnosed with sepsis on admission.

Three patients with cirrhosis developed acute decompensation and ACLF following surgery: in 2 patients following cardiothoracic and in 1 patient following abdominal surgery.

Of the 71 patients with ACLF, 9 patients underwent LT within the time frame of 90 days (between 3 and 36 days after ICU admission).

PARAGRAPH

The characteristics of the patients with ACLF and the 71 matched patients with sepsis are shown (Table 1).

The majority of the 71 septic patients were admitted after major surgery (48%) or because of a respiratory disease (21%).

All 71 non-ACLF septic patients had an infection upon admission.

Patients with ACLF clearly displayed higher admission bilirubin and higher maximum bilirubin during ICU stay compared to non-ACLF septic ICU patients, which resulted in higher SOFA scores (Table 1).

Other baseline risk factors, including demographics, presence of other comorbidities and clinical parameters of illness severity were comparable between the two cohorts.

Short-term outcome in patients with ACLF appeared similar to the septic ICU patients (Table 2).

Specifically, the ACLF and the sepsis cohort were similar regarding duration of ICU and hospital stay, development of new ICU acquired infections, new organ failure, new septic shock, and ICU, hospital and 90-day mortality.

Also, the need for organ support, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressor and renal replacement therapy, was similar in both groups.

LT-free ICU and hospital mortality were also similar between ACLF and non-ACLF septic patients, whereas LT-free 90-day mortality tended to be higher in patients with ACLF (43% vs. 27%, p = 0.06).

LT-free ICU and 90-day mortality in ACLF 1 was 0% (0/7) and 14% (1/7), in ACLF 2 19% (6/32) and 32% (10/31), and in ACLF 3 40% (10/25) and 62.5% (15/24), respectively.

ACLF 3 patients with 3, 4, 5 or 6 organ failures had an LT-free ICU and 90-day mortality of 45.5% (5/11) and 70% (7/10), 22.2% (2/9) and 66.6% (6/9), 50% (2/4) and 50% (2/4) and 100% (1/1) and 100% (1/1), respectively.

PARAGRAPH

To exclude the possibility that sepsis induced bias in the comparison of outcome, we also compared the 71 patients with ACLF to a medical ICU population.

Seventy-one patients were matched for the same baseline risk factors as the septic group, however including the presence of sepsis on admission (70%) (Table 1).

The majority of the latter group was admitted for a respiratory disease (42%) or gastrointestinal or hepatic disease (28%).

In the latter group none of the patients had chronic liver disease, 4 were admitted for acute liver failure (3 due to paracetamol and 1 due to Amanita ingestion).

As in the septic patient population, the ACLF group had higher admission and maximum in-ICU bilirubin and hence higher SOFA scores, compared to the medical ICU group.

Other baseline risk factors were comparable in both groups.

This second comparison again demonstrated that the ICU outcome was not different between patients with ACLF and non-ACLF patients with a similar severity of illness (Table 2).

ACLF and medical ICU cohorts were similar regarding length of ICU and hospital stay, development of new infections, new onset organ failure or septic shock, as well as the need for organ support.

In addition, ICU, hospital and 90-day mortality were also comparable between these two groups.

PARAGRAPH

A multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis assessing the impact of ACLF on time-to-alive discharge from ICU, adjusted for baseline risk factors, indicated that APACHE II score and sepsis on admission were significantly associated with a lower likelihood of an early ICU discharge whereas the diagnosis of ACLF was not (Table 3).

For both comparisons similar results were found for likelihood of an early hospital discharge (data not shown).

When those patients receiving an LT within 90 days of their ICU admission where excluded from the analysis, ACLF was still not a determining factor for an LT-free time-to-alive discharge from the ICU or the hospital (data not shown).

Also, when receiving an LT was added to the model as an additional factor, it did not determine time-to-alive discharge from the ICU or hospital (data not shown).

SECTION

Immune response of patients with ACLF and non-ACLF patients with comparable baseline risk factors

PARAGRAPH

The ACLF cohort had significantly higher bilirubin levels (Table 1), but lower CRP values and platelet counts than the two ICU cohorts throughout the first week in ICU (Fig. 1).

However, the white blood cell count, indicative of the inflammatory response, was similarly elevated in ACLF and non-ACLF patients (Fig. 1).

PARAGRAPH

In a subset of 50 patients with ACLF and 50 matched non-ACLF septic patients, cytokines were quantified on day 1 following ICU admission (Table S1).

All quantified cytokines were comparable between ACLF and non-ACLF patient cohorts (Table 4).

Only day 1 CCL13 serum levels were significantly lower and TNF-α significantly higher in patients with ACLF.

Of note IL-8 and IL-6 levels were similarly elevated in both ACLF and non-ACLF groups.

IL-10 levels were significantly higher in non-survivors 2.5 (1.3–9.0) vs. survivors 1.3 (0.6–4.4; p = 0.03) in both ACLF and septic cohorts.

PARAGRAPH

As renal replacement therapy may affect cytokine levels, we analyzed both patient groups after excluding patients receiving renal replacement therapy (ACLF group: 2 continuous veno-venous hemofiltration; Septic group: 1 continuous veno-venous hemofiltration and 1 intermittent hemodialysis).

We confirmed the initial observation that TNF-α levels are higher and CCL13 serum levels significantly lower in patients with ACLF.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Patients with ACLF that develop organ failure have high short-term mortality.

However, it is not known if the clinical course and mortality associated with ACLF is different from other ICU populations.

In this study, using the Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF) criteria to select patients with ACLF, we demonstrated that the ICU outcome in these patients is similar to a propensity matched non-ACLF ICU population without chronic liver disease.

Specifically, we demonstrated that the length of ICU stay, the development of organ failure, new infections or septic shock, and the need for organ support, as well as ICU and hospital mortality did not differ between matched populations.

PARAGRAPH

Although ACLF as a clinical entity is not disputed by the major hepatology societies including the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver, controversy still exists regarding a universal definition of this syndrome.2

In the United States, ACLF is generally regarded as the manifestation of sepsis in cirrhosis, whereas in Asia emphasis is placed on the development of jaundice and encephalopathy before other signs of decompensation.

According to CLIF and EASL, ACLF refers to acute decompensation in patients with cirrhosis often because of a precipitating (hepatic or extrahepatic) event followed by the development of multi-organ failure.

PARAGRAPH

During the disease course of cirrhosis, admission to the ICU is often required because of episodes of acute decompensation and progression to organ failure, associated with impaired survival proportional to the type and number of failing organs.19,20

In the CANONIC study, a multicenter prospective European study, a clear association was shown between increasing ACLF grade and 90-day mortality that ranged from 41% in ACLF-1, to 52% in ACLF-2 and 79% in ACLF-3.4

Of specific note however only 31% of patients with ACLF in the CANONIC study were admitted to the ICU upon admission or at any time during their disease course.4

PARAGRAPH

Due to the poor prognosis associated with ACLF and the perception regarding futility of care, the initiation of organ support in the ICU is often questioned by intensive care physicians and hepatologists alike, especially in those patients not eligible for LT. However, we now demonstrate that ICU outcome in patients with ACLF is similar to both septic and medical ICU patients with comparable admission disease severity scores.

In addition, our study demonstrated that patients with ACLF receiving maximal ICU and organ support had overall 90-day mortality rates of 40% which is lower than reported in the CANONIC study.

PARAGRAPH

Of considerable interest, although patients with ACLF in our study had significantly higher bilirubin levels with consequently higher SOFA scores on admission, this did not impact the ICU outcome including the need and duration of organ support, length of ICU and hospital stay and ICU, hospital and 90-day mortality.

In fact, a multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that the APACHE II score and sepsis on admission were significantly associated with a lower likelihood of an early ICU discharge whereas the diagnosis of ACLF was not.

This finding implies that the ICU course and survival of patients with ACLF is less determined by progressive liver dysfunction but rather by organ failure, as is the case for patients admitted to the ICU with other conditions.

This also suggests that the development of ACLF may be, at least early in its course, reversible through the prevention of infection or the early recognition of sepsis before organ failure ensues.21–23

PARAGRAPH

Outside the context of ICU care, ACLF has been associated with features of important systemic inflammation.4,24,25

White blood cells, plasma levels of CRP and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 are elevated and higher in ACLF compared to cirrhotic patients without ACLF.4,24,25

This excessive ‘cytokine storm’, even observed in patients with ACLF, without bacterial infection, may cause tissue damage, either by direct effects of inflammatory mediators on cell function or as a consequence of organ hypoperfusion.10,26,27

This process when protracted evolves to immune exhaustion that can cause secondary infections and organ failure, resembling the immunological response observed in patients with severe sepsis.10,26,27

In the current study, we observed that patients with ACLF did not develop more new infections or septic shock compared to medical ICU or sepsis cohorts during their ICU stay.

Furthermore, in all 3 study groups white blood cell counts were similarly elevated throughout the first week in the ICU, suggesting a comparable immunological response.

In addition, the acute cytokine response on day 1 in the ICU appeared largely similar in patients with ACLF and septic patients when matched for severity of illness and baseline risk factors.

In our study we did observe lower CCL-13 and higher TNF-α levels in patients with ACLF, which were already observed by others.28

Circulating CRP was significantly lower in patients with ACLF than in septic or other medical ICU patients, likely explained by a lower CRP secretion rate due to liver dysfunction, making it a less reliable marker to assess severity of inflammation in this specific population.29–31

However, although CRP levels were lower in ACLF, they mirrored the CRP levels observed in the septic and medical ICU patients peaking at day 2–3 in all populations.

Overall, the similar inflammatory/immunological response could, at least in part, explain why ACLF and critically ill non-ACLF patients displayed the same incidence of new infections and new septic shock in our study.

PARAGRAPH

Taken together, our data suggest that patients with ACLF should have the same initial ICU management as other ICU populations.

Patients with ACLF, when eligible, may additionally benefit from transplantation and should be evaluated promptly, if this therapy is deemed appropriate.

This was already suggested by Gustot et al., who observed that ACLF is a very dynamic clinical syndrome and that the evolution of the ACLF grade between diagnosis and day 4–7 was the best predictor of short-term mortality.5

Furthermore, a recent study showed that LT even in the most severely ill ACLF grade 3 patients, improved their poor prognosis leading to similar survival rates as achieved for transplanted patients with lower ACLF grades.32

Importantly, whereas ICU, hospital and 90-day mortality were comparable, LT-free 90-day mortality tended to be higher in patients with ACLF compared to non-ACLF septic patients in our study, confirming the fact that patients with cirrhosis remain at higher risk even after successful ICU care.

Although our study may have been underpowered to detect more subtle differences in mortality, these findings should indeed further encourage physicians to evaluate patients with ACLF for LT during their ICU stay and within 90 days after successful ICU admission.13,33,34

A difference in survival rate in transplanted vs. non-transplanted patients with ACLF was already observed during the first 50 days by other investigators although more work is clearly needed to establish the effect of ICU admission per se on transplant outcomes in frail ICU survivors.32

PARAGRAPH

This study has several limitations.

First, as indicated above, the study may have been underpowered to detect specific differences between ACLF and non-ACLF patients.

Also, we only quantified plasma cytokine levels on day 1, a potential different response in patients with ACLF to more prolonged critical illness can therefore not be excluded.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, patients with ACLF admitted to the ICU display a similar initial inflammatory host response and a comparable short-term ICU outcome as matched septic or other medical ICU patients.

Together, these findings suggest that ICU care in patients with cirrhosis and organ failure is not universally futile, and that patients with ACLF warrant the same ICU treatment as non-cirrhotic patients with end organ failure.

In addition, patients with ACLF should be evaluated for LT early on during their ICU stay.
