TITLE

The intensive care unit course and outcome in acute-on-chronic liver failure are comparable to other populations

PARAGRAPH

Liver function may abruptly deteriorate in patients with chronic liver disease with cirrhosis, often resulting in these patients being admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with organ failure.

Previous studies have indicated that this sudden deterioration, called acute-on-chronic liver failure is associated with very high mortality rates, which often resulted in deferred ICU care because of a perception of futility.

Our study now shows that the ICU course and outcome are not different when patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure are compared to other ICU patients matched for severity of illness.

This demonstrates that patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure deserve the same ICU care given to other ICU populations.
