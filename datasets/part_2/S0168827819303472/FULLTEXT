TITLE

Liver infiltrating T cells regulate bile acid metabolism in experimental cholangitis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

In primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), T cells are likely involved in targeting biliary epithelial cells.1

Chronic bile duct inflammation leads to cholestasis, biliary fibrosis and potential malignant transformation in the case of PSC.2

Adaptive immune responses are considered to contribute to early as well as late stages of disease.3

Numerous genetic risk loci for PBC and PSC were identified that encode for genes involved in adaptive immune responses4–6 and portal infiltrates that were predominantly composed of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been described in the livers of patients with PBC and PSC.7–9

Moreover, autoantigens within the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2) are targeted by lymphocytes in PBC.10

In PSC, impaired T cell homeostasis including an imbalance of IL-17 producing T cells and regulatory T cells has been described.11–16

Since current treatment options for these diseases are limited, T cells are an interesting target for novel combination therapies.

PARAGRAPH

In cholestasis, bile acids (BAs) accumulate in serum and liver and may fuel disease progression via nuclear or membrane bound BA receptors or via direct cytotoxic effects such as the induction of apoptosis or oxidative stress.17–19

The synthesis of BAs takes place in hepatocytes by several enzymatic steps using 2 different routes.

The classical BA synthesis pathway is controlled by the enzyme cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), whereas the alternative BA synthesis pathway is initiated by sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) followed by the action of 25-hydroxycholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7B1).

In principle, both pathways produce the same BA species that are conjugated with glycine or taurine, and secreted via the bile.

The transcription factors liver X receptor (LXR) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) control BA synthesis and homeostasis.

FXR is activated by excess intestinal or hepatic BAs, leading to downregulation of CYP7A1 and hepatic basolateral BA transporter expression, and induction of bile salt export pump (BSEP) expression.20,21

PARAGRAPH

It is becoming increasingly clear that lipid metabolites, including BAs, influence the differentiation and function of immune cells.22

The mainly suppressive action of BAs on immune cells could serve to reduce cholestatic liver damage.

Although severe states of inflammation such as sepsis are known to profoundly alter BA metabolism via the action of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF),23 it is currently unknown whether T cells infiltrating the liver are able to modulate BA metabolism.

In order to develop effective combination therapies for immune mediated cholangiopathies, which target both BA- and T cell-induced liver injury, it is essential to understand the role of T cells in the modulation of BA metabolism.

Suppression of bile acid synthesis in acute T cell-mediated cholangitis

PARAGRAPH

To address whether T cell-induced acute cholangitis could affect BA metabolism we performed adoptive T cell transfer experiments in an inducible mouse model of antigen-dependent cholangitis.25

Adoptive transfer of antigen-specific OT-1 CD8+ T cells in K14-OVAp recipient animals which express an MHC class I restricted ovalbumin peptide on biliary epithelial cells resulted in acute cholangitis as demonstrated by increased serum liver enzymes and histopathological periportal and portal inflammation (Fig. 1A-C).

The expression of genes encoding rate-limiting enzymes of the classical and alternative BA synthesis pathways were significantly downregulated in K14-OVAp animals after OT-1 cell transfer (Fig. 1D).

To determine whether T cells were responsible for modulating BA metabolism in this setting, we crossed the established K14-OVAp mouse model with Rag1−/− mice, which lack mature T and B cells.

Adoptive transfer of antigen-specific OT-1 CD8+ T cells in K14-OVApxRag1−/− mice induced portal and periportal inflammation (Fig. 1E-G).

Expression of genes critical for the classical BA synthesis pathway Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 were found to be significantly downregulated (Fig. 1H) in recipient mice lacking mature T and B cells, suggesting the involvement of transferred T cells in suppression of BA synthesis.

SECTION

CD8+ T cells induced severe cholangitis in a new mouse model of sclerosing cholangitis

PARAGRAPH

In order to further dissect the contribution of T cells to the suppression of BA metabolism in cholangitis and to better recreate the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in human cholangiopathies, we aimed to establish a new mouse model, which allows T cell-induced acute cholangitis on the background of BA induced sclerosing cholangitis.

To this end, K14-OVAp mice were crossed with Mdr2−/− mice (Mdr2−/−xK14-OVAp).

Antigen-specific CD8+ T cell transfer resulted in severe portal and periportal inflammation in Mdr2−/−xK14-OVAp recipient mice (Fig. 2).

Serum liver enzymes were significantly elevated (ALT levels: OT-1 mean ± 1,111 U/L vs. control mean ± 272 U/L; p = 0.0001) and numbers of liver infiltrating lymphocytes were significantly increased on day 8 after OT-1 CD8+ T cell transfer (Fig. 2A).

Histopathological examinations revealed periportal bile infarcts (Fig. 2B,C).

Fibrosis development was not significantly affected in this short-term model (data not shown).

To demonstrate periductal inflammation throughout the whole liver in vivo, we performed MRI scans employing 3D reconstruction (Fig. 2D and Supplementary movie).

In brief, the T2-weighted imaging illustrated inflamed (bright) periportal 8 days after OT-1 T cell transfer.

SECTION

Highly activated, antigen-specific transferred CD8+ T cells localized around bile ducts

PARAGRAPH

To demonstrate that liver damage was mediated by the transferred antigen-specific T cells, we used the congenic marker CD45.1 to show that liver infiltrates contained predominantly transferred OT-1 T cells (56% transferred OT-1 cells of total CD8+ T cells, compared to spleen: 7.7% OT-1 cells of total CD8+ T cells).

Intracellular IFN-γ- and TNF-staining demonstrated that the vast majority of transferred T cells were highly activated (Fig. 3A,B).

To clarify whether transferred OT-1 T cells were the main drivers of liver inflammation we performed a detailed flow cytometric analysis of liver infiltrating lymphocytes.

As expected, we found alterations in different cell populations such as CD4+ T cell, monocytes and neutrophils in Mdr2−/−xK14-OVAp recipient mice following OT-1 CD8+ T cell transfer (Fig. S1).

However, the most striking changes occurred in the T cell population and were caused by transferred OT-1 CD8+ T cells.

Re-stimulated liver infiltrating lymphocytes isolated from Mdr2−/−xK14-OVAp animals on day 8 after transfer of OT-1 T cells produced large amounts of IFN-γ and TNF compared to controls.

In contrast, the production of IFN-γ and TNF by splenic lymphocytes was equally low (Fig. 3C,D).

Immunohistochemical staining of CD45.1 demonstrated that the transferred OT-1 cells mainly localized around CK19-positive bile ducts in areas of portal inflammation (Fig. 3E).

Expression of T cell recruiting chemokines CXCL-9 and CXCL-10 as well as VCAM-1, an integrin necessary for the adhesion of leucocytes, was increased in OT-1 recipient mice (Fig. 3F).

SECTION

CD8+ T cells profoundly changed bile acid metabolism in acute on chronic cholangitis

PARAGRAPH

Since we had previously observed that the transfer of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells into K14-OVAp and K14OVApxRag1−/− mice suppressed BA synthesis, we looked at whether this also takes place on the background of chronic cholangitis.

The expression of genes encoding rate-limiting enzymes of the classical (Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1) and alternative (Cyp7b1) BA synthesis pathways were significantly downregulated in Mdr2−/−xK14-OVAp mice after antigen-specific CD8+ T cell transfer (Fig. 4A).

Moreover, the expression of the gene encoding for hepatocellular BA export (Abcb11, encoding BSEP) was upregulated and for basolateral BA uptake (NTCP and OATP encoded by Slc10a1 and Slco1b2, respectively) were downregulated.

Significant changes in the expression of Nr0b2 (encoding for small heterodimer protein [SHP]) and Nr5a2 (encoding for LRH-1) linked the regulation of BA synthesis to an activation of the FXR-signaling pathway, a nuclear receptor critically involved in the metabolic and postprandial regulation of BA homeostasis.

Next we assessed whether these expression changes reflected altered BA levels of unconjugated and conjugated BAs in serum and livers of Mdr2−/−xK14-OVAp mice after transfer of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.

Corresponding to the changes observed in gene expression, T cell-induced cholangitis resulted in decreased levels of total unconjugated BAs and increased levels of conjugated BAs in serum and liver (Fig. 4B,C).

We performed TUNEL staining to determine whether the changes in BA metabolism were related to parenchymal cell death/apoptosis.

A significant increase of apoptotic cells was detected in the inflamed portal fields but not in liver lobul of Mdr2−/−xK14-OVAp mice after transfer of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells compared to controls (Fig. S2).

These results indicated that T cell-induced liver inflammation in chronic cholangitis orchestrates a transcriptional program that ultimately resulted in the inhibition of BA synthesis and uptake and an induction of biliary BA secretion independent of parenchymal cell death/apoptosis.

PARAGRAPH

In time-course kinetic experiments, we observed a correlation of OT-1 T cell recruitment to the liver with increasing liver damage (Pearson r = 0.8815) and suppression of BA synthesis.

From day 5 on, transferred CD8+ OT-1 T cells could be detected in the livers of Mdr2−/−xK14-OVAp recipient mice, with recruited cell numbers more than doubled, resulting in increased liver enzymes on day 7 (Fig. 5A).

The increase in T cell recruitment to the liver was associated with the aforementioned changes in expression of genes involved in BA metabolism (Fig. 5B), together leading to a decrease of potentially harmful unconjugated BA concentrations in the liver.

PARAGRAPH

To confirm the hypothesis that transferred OT-1 CD8+ T cells themselves were able to induce these changes, we performed cell transfer experiments into Mdr2−/−xK14-OVApxRag1−/− mice, which lack endogenous mature T and B cells.

Histological staining confirmed that transferred OT-1 cells were recruited to the liver and again localized around bile ducts (Fig. S3).

Moreover, OT-1 T cell transfer in recipient mice on the Rag1 knockout background led to a significant downregulation of genes responsible for BA synthesis, similar to observations in recipient mice with mature endogenous lymphocytes (Fig. 5C).

SECTION

TNF and IFN-γ mediated T cell-induced changes in bile acid metabolism

PARAGRAPH

To investigate the mechanism by which OT-1 CD8+ T cells could mediate changes in BA metabolism in Mdr2−/−xK14-OVAp mice, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the liver was measured after adoptive CD8+ T cell transfer (Fig. S4).

Recipient mice with mature endogenous lymphocytes showed hepatic upregulation of several proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12α and IL-12β upon cell transfer.

Most of these cytokines were expressed at lower levels in recipient mice on the Rag1 background.

Since K14-OVAp mice on the Rag1 knockout background showed suppression of BA synthesis, we searched for changes in cytokine expression also evident in Rag1 knockout mice.

The expression of both TNF and IFN-γ was not only increased after recruitment of OT-1 cells to the liver, but was also higher in Mdr2−/−xK14-OVApxRag1−/− recipients compared to RAG1-positive controls (Fig. 5C).

In line, a significant negative correlation was observed between IFN-γ- and TNF-expression and the expression of BA synthesis genes Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1 (Fig. S5).

To determine the functional role of TNF and IFN-γ for the observed changes in gene expression, mice were treated with blocking anti-TNF and anti-IFN-γ antibodies.

The inhibition of TNF and IFN-γ in combination did not affect the recruitment of transferred OT-1 CD8+ T cells into the liver or the severity of liver damage or parenchymal cell apoptosis rate (Fig. 6A-C and Fig. S6).

However, we observed a significant upregulation of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8a1 expression (Fig. 6D) and alterations in BA transporter genes (Fig. 6E) which were related to significant changes in the expression of Nr0b2 and Nr5a2 (Fig. 6F) linking the upregulation of BA synthesis to the FXR-signaling pathway.

Of note, in vitro transwell experiments showed that the modulation of BA metabolism by T cells was not only mediated by the release of cytokines but also dependent on cell-to-cell interaction between hepatocytes and T cells (Fig. 6G and Fig. S7).

SECTION

Reduced expression of BA synthesis genes in human livers of patients with autoimmune, T cell driven liver diseases

PARAGRAPH

To translate the findings that T cell related cytokines may also contribute to the control of BA metabolism in human disease, we investigated gene expression in whole liver tissue from liver biopsies obtained from patients with PBC (n = 16), AIH (n = 22) and PSC (n = 20).

RNA sequencing analysis showed a negative correlation between genes responsible for BA synthesis and hepatic BA uptake with the expression of a set of known TNF- and IFN-γ-regulated genes (Fig. 7).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

T cells significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of PBC and PSC and represent a potential therapeutic target in autoimmune cholestatic liver diseases.8,9,31–33

Emerging data suggest a suppressive effect of BAs on the functioning of T cells,22 but so far it has not been investigated whether T cells in turn could affect BA metabolism.

In the new mouse model described here, which combines chronic and acute T cell-induced bile duct injury, we could show for the first time that recruitment of CD8+ T cells targeting bile ducts resulted in profound changes in BA metabolism, signified by a reduction of BA uptake and synthesis, and increased BA export from hepatocytes.

CD8+ T cell recruitment to the liver led to reduced intrahepatic levels of unconjugated BAs that could be explained by a profound downregulation of enzymes regulating both the classical and alternative BA synthesis pathways (Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1 and Cyp27a1, Cyp7b1).

In addition, transfer of T cells reduced the expression of basolateral bile acid uptake transporters Ntcp and Oatp and increased the expression of the BSEP, which ultimately resulted in increased serum levels of conjugated BAs and reduced intrahepatic levels of toxic, unconjugated BAs.

Mechanistically, the proinflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF were at least in part responsible for the observed changes in BA metabolism.

IFN-γ and TNF act as a key drivers of liver inflammation34–37 and blocking TNF is emerging as a targeted treatment option for difficult to treat AIH.38

Inhibition of both of these cytokines in mice using an antibody-based approach restored the suppression of genes involved in BA synthesis, export and hepatic uptake in vivo, without changing the degree of liver inflammation.

This effect on BA metabolism was also seen in in vivo experiments blocking both cytokines separately.

However, an additional effect of blocking IFN-γ on liver inflammation cannot be excluded and should be further explored (Fig. S6).

Mechanistically, IFN-γ and TNF could influence FXR-mediated signaling pathways.

The nuclear receptor FXR is the master regulator of BA homeostasis.20,21

Activated FXR negatively regulates the expression of different genes involved in BA synthesis and basolateral hepatic BA uptake, whereas it induces the expression of genes involved in hepatic BA export.39

We here report a significant regulation of the SHP and LRH-1, which act downstream of FXR to suppress the expression of Cyp7a1.

However, we cannot exclude an effect on other signaling pathways since it has been previously described that TNF can lead to a rapid downregulation of NTCP expression by FXR-independent mechanisms.40,41

PARAGRAPH

TNF has been shown to activate the MAP/JNK pathway and to downregulate the expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4) through MEKK1 dependent pathways resulting in an inhibition of Cyp7a1 transcription in hepatocytes.42,43

In addition, sepsis is known to lead to profound changes in BA metabolism, with the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IFN-γ likely involved in the impairment of hepatocellular transporters including MRP2, OATP, BSEP and NTCP.23,44

However, in contrast to our findings, endotoxin-induced inflammation has been characterized by the downregulation of hepatic BSEP expression in rodents and primary human hepatocytes.41,45,46

Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1β and IFN-γ have been reported to repress genes regulating BA transport and synthesis in several inflammatory models, including necrotizing enterocolitis, lipopolysaccharide treatment, IL-6 or turpentine treatment and C. rodentium infection.47–50

However, it remained unclear which cell type mediated these effects and it was unknown whether liver infiltrating T cells could themselves modulate BA metabolism.

In the current study, we showed for the first time in vivo that T cells were able to induce profound changes in BA metabolism independent of hepatocyte apoptosis.

Interestingly, our in vitro data suggested that T cell contact with hepatocytes was required in addition to the release of cytokines, a mechanism that clearly requires further investigations.

Traditional views regard T cells as harmful in cholestatic liver injury, but treatment targeting T cells in cholestatic liver disease has so far been disappointing.9,51

Herein, we describe a mechanism by which the liver enables proinflammatory CD8+ T cells to regulate BA metabolism.

It is tempting to speculate that this happens to protect the liver from additional cholestatic damage and that an unselective targeting of T cells in the liver may not be effective in immune-mediated cholangiopathies.

PARAGRAPH

We suggest that treatment regimens targeting T cells, in addition to activation of FXR to suppress the increase in BA synthesis resulting from depletion of T cells, could be tested in preclinical models of immune-mediated cholangitis in the future.
