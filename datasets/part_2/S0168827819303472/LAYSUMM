TITLE

Liver infiltrating T cells regulate bile acid metabolism in experimental cholangitis

PARAGRAPH

Dysregulation of bile acid metabolism and T cells can contribute to the development of cholangiopathies.

Before targeting T cells for the treatment of cholangiopathies, it should be determined whether they exert protective effects on bile acid metabolism.

Herein, we demonstrate that T cell-induced cholangitis resulted in decreased levels of harmful unconjugated bile acids.

T cells were able to directly control synthesis and metabolism of bile acids, a process which was dependent on the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IFN-Î³.

Understanding the effect of lymphocytes on bile acid metabolism will help in the design of combined treatment strategies for cholestatic liver diseases.
