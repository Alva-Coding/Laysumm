TITLE

Inhibition of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 improves experimental non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

PARAGRAPH

There are currently no pharmacological treatment options for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is now the most frequent liver disease.

Necroptosis is a regulated process of cell death that can occur in hepatocytes during NAFLD.

Herein, we show that RIPK1, a gatekeeper of the necroptosis pathway that is activated in NAFLD, can be inhibited by RIPA-56 to reduce not only liver injury, inflammation and fibrosis, but also steatosis in experimental models.

These results highlight the potential of RIPK1 as a therapeutic target in NAFLD.
