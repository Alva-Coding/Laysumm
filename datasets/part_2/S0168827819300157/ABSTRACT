ABSTRACT

TITLE

Time association between hepatitis C therapy and hepatocellular carcinoma emergence in cirrhosis: Relevance of non-characterized nodules

PARAGRAPH

Despite direct-acting antivirals being highly effective at eradicating hepatitis C virus infection, their impact on the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial.

We analyzed the clinical and radiological outcome of cirrhotic patients treated with interferon-free regimens to estimate the risk of developing HCC.

PARAGRAPH

This was a retrospective multicenter study focusing on cirrhotic patients treated with direct-acting antivirals until December 2016.

Clinical and radiologic characteristics were collected before the start of antiviral therapy, at follow-up and at HCC development.

Diagnosis of HCC was centrally validated and its incidence was expressed as HCC/100 person-years.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 1,123 patients were included (60.6% males, 83.8% Child-Pugh A) and 95.2% achieved a sustained virologic response.

Median time of follow-up was 19.6 months.

Seventy-two patients developed HCC within a median of 10.3 months after starting antiviral treatment.

HCC incidence was 3.73 HCC/100 person-years (95% CI 2.96–4.70).

Baseline liver function, alcohol intake and hepatic decompensation were associated with a higher risk of HCC.

The relative risk was significantly increased in patients with non-characterized nodules at baseline 2.83 (95% CI 1.55–5.16) vs. absence of non-characterized nodules.

When excluding these patients, the risk remained increased.

PARAGRAPH

These data expose a clear-cut time association between interferon-free treatment and HCC.

The mechanisms involved in the increased risk of HCC emergence in the short term require further investigation.
