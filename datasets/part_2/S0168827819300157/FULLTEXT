TITLE

Time association between hepatitis C therapy and hepatocellular carcinoma emergence in cirrhosis: Relevance of non-characterized nodules

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Elimination of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is now a feasible goal through the availability of oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).1

Treatment is safe and it achieves a high rate of sustained virologic response (SVR) both in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients.1

Progressive liver function impairment is halted in patients that achieve SVR and long-term follow-up studies should define the impact of successful treatment on the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Malignant transformation occurs years before clinical recognition and thus, even if the viral infection is solved, the progression of transformed clones may still take place and ultimately, result in clinically detectable HCC.2–5

Hence, the elimination of viral infection should prevent new oncogenic events and HCC incidence is likely to decrease after several years.

However, the current controversial issue is not whether HCC incidence will vanish in the long-term, but whether there is a time-associated peak in HCC incidence after DAA therapy.6

Such a peak would mimic the increased HCC recurrence associated with DAAs that was reported some time ago and is still a matter of debate.7–12

The suggested mechanism for an increased recurrence risk was an imbalance in immune surveillance related to a sudden change in hepatic inflammation, which may also occur in patients without a prior diagnosis of HCC.11,13–16

The absence of randomized controlled trials prevents a direct comparison between treated and untreated patients.

Thus, any insight into this issue should come from careful description of HCC development in large cohorts of patients treated with DAA.11

Comparison should be attempted with existing data of almost contemporary cohorts of untreated patients.

Any comparisons must consider that impaired liver function does not impede DAA therapy, as was the case for interferon-based regimens.

In that sense, the prospective HALT-C17 and EPIC trials18 reported the HCC risk in 2 well-followed homogeneous cohorts of untreated HCV-viremic patients with compensated cirrhosis, in which HCC development was the main endpoint.

The prospective CIRVIR study in France has also provided the follow-up data in a population of HCV cirrhotic patients undergoing HCC screening by ultrasound (US).19,20

Hence, they offer valuable comparative information.

Unfortunately, none of the registration studies assessing the efficacy and safety of DAAs included prospective US examination to detect HCC and follow-up was too short in some studies.11

Therefore, they are not useful to attempt any comparison.

PARAGRAPH

Our aim was to estimate the risk of HCC in a cohort of cirrhotic patients treated with DAAs, followed over a long period of time and to shed light on the unanswered question of whether DAA-based antiviral treatment of hepatitis C changes the short-term risk for de novo HCC.

SECTION

Patients and methods

PARAGRAPH

This is a retrospective, observational, multicenter study from 9 tertiary reference hospitals in Spain.

All consecutive cirrhotic patients of the different hospitals starting an all-oral interferon (IFN)-free regimen before 30 October 2015 were considered.

Cases were recruited in each hospital registry and were centralized in Hospital Clinic.

The end of follow-up was set as 31 December 2016.

PARAGRAPH

The inclusion criteria, patient characterization, hepatitis C treatment and ethics are described in the supplementary material.

SECTION

Clinical assessment of evolutionary events and follow-up

PARAGRAPH

Patients were followed until 31 December 2016 or until the date of one of the following evolutionary events: death, liver transplantation or loss to follow-up.

Patients’ status was established as alive or dead at the end of follow-up.

HCC occurrence was the main outcome of the study; liver cancer characterization is described in the supplementary material and methods section.

SECTION

Radiology and pathology evaluation

PARAGRAPH

The presence of liver cancer was ruled out by abdominal imaging assessment in all patients before entering the study.

The detection of benign entities or non-characterized nodules together with their size and pattern were registered.

Non-characterized nodules were defined as nodules ≤10 mm or nodules >10 mm but in which HCC diagnosis was ruled out before starting DAA by contrast-enhanced ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance or biopsy.

PARAGRAPH

Baseline nodules and those appearing during follow-up were evaluated in each center following their clinical practice and ultimately sent to Hospital Clinic for a central evaluation (AD, EB, CA).

The imaging dates, type of images and the description of liver nodules at each time-point of the radiologic evaluation were registered.

PARAGRAPH

Radiologic assessment was divided into baseline (pre-DAA images [pre-DAAi]) and follow-up (post-DAA images [post-DAAi]) images.

For those patients who did not develop liver nodules after starting DAA, we registered the first post-DAAi (defined as the first imaging study performed after DAA initiation) and the last post-DAAi (defined as the last radiologic evaluation at the time of the database lock) ruling out the presence of nodules.

For those patients who developed liver nodules after starting DAA, the first and successive post-DAAi to assess tumor progression or response were registered.

Two pathologists with more than 10 years’ experience in HCC (AD, MS) performed the central pathology evaluation of biopsies.

Central radiologists and pathologists were blinded to the patient clinical evolution.

PARAGRAPH

Time points for the analysis and the methods for liver cancer characterization are described in the supplementary material.

SECTION

Statistics

PARAGRAPH

Statistical analysis was performed by 2 statisticians (VS, JR).

Quantitative variables were expressed as median and interquartile range [IQR 25th-75th percentiles]; in case of follow-up, median and IQR were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and December 31st 2016 was defined as censoring date in case of absence of date for loss to follow-up or end of follow-up.

Categorical variables were described as absolute frequencies and percentages (%).

Main analyses, estimation of incidence of HCC, and their 95% CIs were performed using Poisson models, unadjusted in order to establish a crude estimation of HCC incidence, and including potential clinical factor modifiers of this incidence in order to obtain an adjusted estimation of incidence of HCC.

These models were also performed for comparing subgroups according to external criteria described in HALT-C17 and EPIC18 studies.

These estimations of predicted individual incidence rates are expressed as HCC/100 person-years (HCC/100 PY).

Evaluation of changes in estimation of risk of HCC incidence compared by factors are also shown graphically.

They depict the magnitude of the incidences and their 95% CIs accompanied by the estimation of relative risk (RR) and its 95% CI.

Additionally, expected cumulative probability functions were obtained from estimated values of incidence rate obtained from unadjusted models previously established.

Other comparisons between groups (presence of HCC) for quantitative or ordinal variables were assessed by Mann-Whitney U test.

Fisher’s exact test was used to compare categorical variables.

p values ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant and all calculations were performed with SAS software, version 9.4.

Due to the observational pragmatic nature and characteristics of this study, no formal sample size calculation was performed and no methods for multiplicity were used.

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

During the inclusion period, 1,825 HCV-infected patients with cirrhosis were treated with all-oral DAAs.

Referral bias was avoided by the exclusion of 22 patients with de novo HCC who received DAA therapy in other centers.

A total number of 1,250 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were considered for the study in the sites.

After central review, 1,123 cirrhotic patients were finally included (Fig. S1).

Patients with more than 8 months (6 months ± 2 months) between pre-DAAi and the first post-DAAi were considered as “patients without adherence to adequate HCC screening” and represented 26.5% of the cohort (n = 297).

Four patients did not have follow-up imaging after starting DAA treatment because of liver transplantation (n = 3) or death (n = 1) (Fig. 1).

SECTION

Baseline characteristics

PARAGRAPH

The baseline cohort characteristics are depicted in Table 1.

Cirrhosis diagnosis was mainly based on the presence of portal hypertension or radiological signs of cirrhosis (48.7%), previous liver decompensation (21,1%) or LSM ≥14 KPa (26.7%).

Most patients were male (60.5%), with a median age of 59.3 years (IQR 52.4–68.4) and 941 patients (83.8%) were classified as Child-Pugh A. LSM was performed in 81.9% of the cohort; median LSM was 21.3 KPa (IQR 16.1–30.9).

HVPG measurement was performed in 25.7% of the patients, and the median value was 14 mmHg (IQR 10.5–18); 71.5% of the patients (n = 803) had CSPH at baseline.

PARAGRAPH

Baseline imaging (pre-DAAi) did not identify nodules in 995 patients (89% of the cohort).

In the remaining 128 cases, 4% (n = 48) presented benign nodules and 7% (n = 80) presented non-characterized nodules (Table 1 and Tables S1, S3).

SECTION

Follow-up times and evolutionary events

PARAGRAPH

The median clinical follow-up from DAA initiation to end of follow-up was 19.6 months (IQR 16.8–23.3).

The median radiologic follow-up (from pre-DAAi to the last available post-DAAi or HCC development) was 12.33 months (IQR 9.04–15.94).

During that time, 72 patients (6.4%) developed HCC and 31 patients (2.7%) died (Fig. 1).

PARAGRAPH

The median time between the pre-DAAi and the date of DAA initiation was 2.57 (IQR 1.24–4.1) months; 8.9% of patients (n = 100) had a pre-DAAi performed more than 6 months before starting DAA (Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

The median time between pre-DAAi and the first screening post-DAAi was 6.6 (IQR 5.82–8.16) months.

SECTION

Antiviral treatment and virologic response

PARAGRAPH

Most patients (65.1%) received a 12-week DAA regimen and 851 patients (75.8%) received concomitant ribavirin.

SVR was achieved in 95.2% of cases (n = 1,070).

Non-response (4.8%) was classified as virologic failure in 40 cases, 3 patients discontinued treatment early due to adverse events and 8 patients were lost to follow-up.

Treatment failure was significantly more frequent in patients receiving initial suboptimal regimens (i.e. faldaprevir/deleobuvir or simeprevir/daclatasvir) or in those patients with more advanced liver disease.1

SVR in Child-Pugh B/C was 90.5% vs. 97% in Child-Pugh A patients.

SECTION

Assessment of HCC risk in DAA-treated patients: estimated incidences

PARAGRAPH

In order to evaluate HCC risk and to avoid bias due to heterogeneous adherence to the HCC screening, the HCC risk assessment was done in 4 steps:

SECTION

HCC incidence regardless of the time of pre-DAAi and/or adherence to HCC screening

PARAGRAPH

Crude estimation was 3.73 HCC/100 PY (95% CI 2.96–4.70) in the whole cohort.

Estimation by Child-Pugh was 2.93 HCC/100 PY in CP-A (95% CI 2.20–3.90), 7.81 HCC/100 PY in CP-B (95% CI 5.19–11.76) and 5.73 HCC/100 PY (95% CI 2.42–4.65) in the limited cohort of 23 CP-C patients.

The estimated HCC incidence differed according to the pre-DAAi information: the RR of developing HCC was 2.83 (95% CI 1.55–5.16) in patients with non-characterized nodules compared to patients without nodules and 0.36 (0.05–2.62) in those patients with benign nodules compared to those with no nodules (Fig. 2).

PARAGRAPH

In CP-A patients, this incidence was 1.46 (95% CI 0.21–10.36), 2.67 (95% CI 1.94–3.67) and 7.24 (95% CI 3.62–14.48) HCC/100 PY in patients with benign nodules, no nodules or non-characterized nodules, respectively.

SECTION

HCC incidence in patients with adequate adherence to HCC screening

PARAGRAPH

Crude estimation in those patients who were under HCC screening (n = 826) was 3.83 HCC/100 PY (95% CI 2.92–5.03) (Fig. 3).

Estimations by Child-Pugh were 2.93 HCC/100 PY in CP-A (95% CI 2.09–4.13), 8.14 HCC/100 PY in CP-B (95% CI 5.06–13.09) and 8.82 HCC/100 PY (95% CI 2.21–35.28) in the limited cohort of just 2 CP-C patients.

The estimated HCC incidence differed according to the pre-DAAi information.

The RR of developing HCC was 2.93 (95% CI 1.50–5.72; p = 0.0016) between patients without nodules and patients with non-characterized nodules, and 0.52 (95% CI 0.07–3.77) between patients with no nodules and those with benign nodules.

PARAGRAPH

In CP-A patients (n = 692), the incidence was 2.03 (95% CI 0.29–14.41), 2.63 (95% CI 1.79–3.87) and 6.77 (95% CI 3.04–15.06) HCC/100 PY in patients with benign nodules, no nodules or non-characterized nodules, respectively.

SECTION

HCC incidence in patients without adequate adherence to HCC screening

PARAGRAPH

Crude estimation in these patients (n = 297) was 3.48 HCC/100 PY (95% CI 2.24–5.39) (Fig. 3).

Estimations by Child-Pugh were 2.93 HCC/100 PY in CP-A (95% CI 1.74–4.95), 7.02 HCC/100 PY in CP-B (95% CI 2.16–15.64) and it was not estimated in the 7 CP-C patients due to the absence of HCC events.

The estimated HCC incidence differed according to the pre-DAAi information.

The RR of developing HCC was 2.38 (95% CI 0.55–10.24) between patients without nodules and patients with non-characterized nodules.

PARAGRAPH

In CP-A patients (n = 249), this risk was 2.75 (95% CI 1.56–4.85) and 9.16 (95% CI 2.29–36.63) HCC/100 PY in patients with no nodules or non-characterized nodules, respectively.

SECTION

Relative risk of developing HCC adjusted by baseline variables

PARAGRAPH

The RR of developing HCC between Child C vs. Child A patients was 1.95 (95% CI 0.47–8.04; p = 0.3540) and between Child B vs. Child A patients 2.66 (95% CI 1.62–4.39; p <0.0001).

Regarding patients with CSPH, RR was 2.11 (95% CI 1.11–4.01; p = 0.0224) as compared to those without it.

Finally, the RR of HCC in patients with pre-DAA non-characterized nodules was 2.91 (95% CI 1.60–5.31; p = 0.0005) compared to those without nodules/benign nodules at that time-point (Table 2).

PARAGRAPH

The RR when considering CP-A patients only (83.8% of the cohort) is depicted (Table 3).

The incidence of HCC in CP-A patients with non-characterized nodules at pre-DAAi was 7.24 HCC/100 PY (95% CI 3.62–14.48), compared with 2.77 HCC/100 PY (95% CI 1.29–5.93; p = 0.0087) in CP-A patients without non-characterized or benign nodules at pre-DAAi.

Finally, the RR of HCC development was 2.71 (95% CI 1.27–5.81; p = 0.0103) between patients with non-characterized nodules at pre-DAAi in comparison with those without nodules and 0.55 (95% CI 0.08–3.98; p = 0.5512) between patients without nodules and with benign nodules.

SECTION

Characteristics of liver nodules during the follow-up

PARAGRAPH

A total of 152 patients developed de novo liver nodules that were suspicious of HCC (Fig. 1).

HCC diagnosis was confirmed in 72 patients (Table 4), supporting a raw 3.73 HCC/100 PY incidence.

Fifty-four of them (75%) were diagnosed according to non-invasive criteria.

Thirty-seven liver nodules without specific radiologic profiles were biopsied: 18 were HCC.

The remaining nodules (n = 80) corresponded to pancreatic metastasis (n = 1), neuroendocrine tumor (n = 1), lymphoma (n = 1) and non-malignant entities such as dysplastic nodules, regenerative nodules or hamartomas (n = 77).

The median times from DAA initiation and from DAA finalization to HCC diagnosis were 10.3 (IQR 5.7–15.9) and 6.6 (IQR 2.2–11.9) months, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

Table 4 presents the main characteristics at diagnosis of the 72 patients with HCC, including the first therapy received.

Out of the 72 patients described, 13 had presented with non-characterized nodules on US before starting DAAs and 6 of them developed the HCC in the same non-characterized nodule that were seen before starting DAAs.

More than 50% of patients were classified as BCLC 0/A, of whom 59.2% received potentially curative treatments.

However, after a median follow-up of 4.13 (IQR 3.19–8.00) months, 21% (n = 15) of these patients developed HCC recurrence/progression and 2 patients presented spontaneous HCC regression.

PARAGRAPH

Fourteen patients died within the following 6.68 (IQR 3.15–9.69) months after HCC diagnosis.

At the time of DAA initiation, 7 of them were classified as CP-A, 6 as CP-B and 1 as CP-C.

At the time of first recurrence 42.9% were BCLC-A, 18.8% B, 6.1% C and 28.6% BCLC-D.

SECTION

Risk of HCC according to DAA virologic response

PARAGRAPH

The HCC rate was 15.67 HCC/100 PY in non-SVR patients (4.8%) vs. 3.06 HCC/100 PY in patients achieving an SVR (95.2%) (Tables S4).

A direct follow-up comparison between these 2 groups is not valid due to the confounding effect of the different baseline characteristics at the time of DAA treatment (37.7% CP-B/C patients vs. 15.1 % in non-SVR vs. SVR patients, respectively).

SECTION

Mortality

PARAGRAPH

Thirty-one patients (13 CP-A, 17 CP-B and 1 CP-C) died during follow-up (Fig. 1): 1.60 deaths/100 PY (95% CI 1.13–2.28).

The median time from DAA initiation and DAA finalization to death was 14.99 (IQR 7.68–19.16) and 11.94 (IQR 4.13–15.77) months, respectively.

The main cause of death was liver decompensation/sepsis in 12 patients (6 of them with concomitant HCC); in the remaining 19 patients, the registered causes were: HCC progression (n = 8), intestinal ischemia (n = 2), liver decompensation/no sepsis (n = 1), pancreatic cancer (n = 1), aortic dissection (n = 1), valvular heart disease (n = 1) and unknown in 5 patients (none of them presented HCC at the last follow-up evaluation).

Death due to HCC represented 45% of the global mortality (14/31).

Among patients who developed HCC, tumor progression was the cause of death in (14/72) 19.4% of cases.

PARAGRAPH

The incidence of death according to the baseline CP-score was 0.81 deaths/100 PY (95% CI 0.47–1.40) and 5.47 deaths/100 PY (95% CI 3.44–8.68) in CP-A and CP-B/C, respectively.

Four out of the 13 CP-A patients had a history of previous decompensation, 10 presented baseline CSPH and none of them presented non-characterized nodules in pre-DAAi.

PARAGRAPH

Additional information about this cohort is reported in the supplementary material.

SECTION

HCC incidence in potential candidates to IFN-therapies

PARAGRAPH

A direct comparison between the risk of developing de novo HCC between our DAA-treated cohort and the historical IFN-treated cohorts is not valid.

However, we estimated the increase of risk, by RR estimation, of developing HCC in patients from our cohort who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the HALT-C17 or the EPIC18 trials, respectively.

These patients were defined as “patients potentially eligible for IFN-based therapy”.

Three hundred ninety-three (35%) of our patients could have been selected for HALT-C, and 563 (50.1%) could have been EPIC candidates.

The estimated incidence of developing HCC was 2.53 HCC/100 PY (95% CI 1.57–4.07) for HALT-C candidates and 2.26 HCC/100 PY (95% CI 1.49–3.43) for EPIC candidates.

The RR between those patients who did not meet the HALT-C and EPIC criteria vs. those who met these criteria in our cohort were 1.70 (95% CI 1.003–2.98) in HALT- C and 2.30 (95% CI 1.40–3.82) EPIC, respectively.

Fig. 4 shows the graphical comparison between the empirical accumulative probability in our sub-cohort of patients who met the HALT-C and EPIC criteria and the empirical accumulative probability of HCC development according to the HALT-C and EPIC data.

Fig. 5 shows the sensitivity analysis but only in patients who were potentially eligible for IFN-based therapy and did not have nodules in the pre-DAAi (n = 353 in HALT-C and n = 511 in EPIC).

In addition, we evaluated the risk in those patients who met the EPIC and HALT-C criteria, but excluded those with a high-risk profile for HCC development, such as those with varices and/or platelet counts and age beyond their cut-off for HCC risk.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Our study suggests that there is an increased emergence of HCC early during follow-up in patients with cirrhosis treated with DAA.

The peak in new cancer cases during follow-up, which appears to be time-related to DAA therapy, is relevant in patients that were shown to have undetermined nodules prior to treatment initiation.

Some of these cases could have corresponded to HCC that was not diagnosed, although this would be an infrequent circumstance as study centers were already involved in studies regarding HCC detection and diagnosis.

Thus, in the majority of patients these undetermined nodules most likely correspond to minute low or high-grade dysplastic foci or macro-regenerative nodules in a cirrhotic liver.

It could be argued that those who developed HCC and had non-characterized nodules could belong to the strata of patients without proper screening.

However, the results do not change when excluding patients without proper screening.

Thus, such a flaw is discarded.

PARAGRAPH

At the same time, we show that the risk of HCC development is increased in patients who had already developed portal hypertension.

This finding is not novel, as it is well known that the risk of HCC increases with the progression of cirrhosis.

However, it is important to put our data in perspective by comparing the observed incidence with that reported in the CIRVIR cohort prior to DAA availability21 which was 1.9 (95% CI 1.3–2.8) at 1st year follow-up, as well as that reported in the HALT-C17 and EPIC trials,18 with the appropriate exclusion of those patients not sharing the inclusion criteria for these studies assessing the impact of long-term IFN administration.

The probability of developing HCC in this sub-group of patients was higher than in those patients who were included in EPIC or HALT-C: 2.06 HCC/100 PY (95% CI 1.3–3.27) in patients who met EPIC without varices, platelets ≥150.000/mm3 and age <58 years-old and 2.02 HCC/100 PY (95% CI 1.12–3.65) in patients who met HALT-C without platelets ≥150.000/mm3 and age <68 years-old (Fig. 5).

PARAGRAPH

Finally, we also analyzed the risk of HCC development in a cohort of Spanish patients treated with IFN.22

The incidence of HCC in that cohort was 2.09 HCC/100 PY for the whole cohort, 0.65 HCC/100 PY in the SVR patients and 1.31 in non-SVR patients.

Thus, the estimation of HCC/100 PY in our cohort may seem similar, but the incidence in SVR patients is clearly higher in our study.

Indeed, the division of HCC risk according to SVR is misleading as risk associated with DAA therapy should not be determined according to the achievement of SVR during follow-up as this success is not known at baseline.

PARAGRAPH

It has been suggested that development of HCC in DAA-treated patients would represent the emergence of already existing clones and would have thus appeared irrespective of treatment and its success.

This is surely the case, but the key point is to what extent DAA therapy is associated with an increased rate of HCC emergence early during follow-up after therapy.

Our data support this possibility and suggest that some clones are primed to grow and become overt cancers in a minority, but clinically relevant proportion of patients.

PARAGRAPH

Up to now, none of the cohort investigations have been designed to assess the incidence of HCC after DAA therapy.

Studies to assess the efficacy of DAA did not have HCC screening in their methodology and/or did not have enough follow-up to secure a minimal time between DAA therapy and US screening.11,15

Registry studies suffer from the same retrospective and flawed design.23–27

In most studies, the profile of the population at baseline is not well registered, the follow-up may not include HCC screening and a variable proportion of the population may be lost to follow-up.28,29

This is a major issue as registration of events may affect those individuals lost to follow-up.

All these limitations are frequently dismissed, as it is far easier to uphold an optimistic message about the benefits of a treatment that has represented a major breakthrough, than to raise concerns about potential unexpected adverse events.

Viral eradication will have a major impact on public health and control the negative consequences of HCV infection in the community.

However, in patients with compensated cirrhosis and normal quality of life, the decision may be more complex, particularly if an US examination in the months prior to treatment has shown the presence of undetermined nodules.

Such observation should prompt a delay of treatment while securing a proper diagnosis of the detected nodules.

If they are unequivocally diagnosed with HCC, anticancer therapy should be instituted and the decision to initiate DAA therapy should be delayed to later stages but retaining the concern regarding a potential priming of HCC recurrence.

If diagnosis is not established, physicians and patients should take a shared decision according to their individualized assessment.7,8,10

PARAGRAPH

The major challenge affects patients with minute, undetermined nodules that may turn into overt HCC during or early after DAA therapy.

Data from Italy30 show that evident nodules classified by biopsy as low or high-grade dysplasia may become HCC during follow-up.

Our cohort includes undetermined nodules <10 mm that were not biopsied according to current recommendations.31

They could correspond to dysplastic nodules or to mere distorted architecture of a cirrhotic liver, and attending physicians did not suspect HCC at all.

Despite this difference with the Iavarone et al. study,30 the HCC incidence is higher and this suggests that the emerging tumors were the result of the evolution of dysplastic nodules and of the growth of already existing subclinical dormant clones of transformed hepatocytes.

The mechanisms involved in the transition from dysplasia to HCC or the growth of dormant clones are not known but immune surveillance is surely involved.3,5,32–34

The issue of immune surveillance was already raised when first describing an increased recurrence rate.

It fits with the description of hepatitis B virus35–38 or herpes virus39 reactivation associated with DAA therapy.

Interestingly, 2 of our patients diagnosed with HCC by biopsy presented tumor regression.

This further suggests that immune surveillance may have failed initially, but afterwards been recovered and prime regression.

However, in most patients this is not observed and despite HCC detection at a potentially treatable stage, the evolution is dismal with tumor recurrence and excessive death rate in a cohort of patients without major liver failure.11,40

PARAGRAPH

Undetermined nodules have to be seen as the tip of the iceberg regarding the presence of HCC.

The sensibility of US to detect HCC is limited and it misses those minute HCCs that already exist at a microscopic level and may be encountered at explant or necropsy.

This is common to all malignancies for which there is a lengthy period of subclinical evolution without image recognition.

Initially, we would detect the first wave of HCCs representing those closer to clinical emergence, while later on we would encounter those which take months to become apparent.

Ultimately, all clones may emerge and few would vanish because of immune recovery.

PARAGRAPH

Our data are not unique.

Cohort studies in France,20 the UK26,27 and Italy8,41 have already exposed a slight increased incidence of HCC early during follow-up.

The relative risk of developing HCC after IFN vs. DAA in the French cohort was 0.59 [0.07–4.70].

Thus, increased risk is not ruled out and longer follow-up may provide more accuracy.

The accurate incidence in the UK cohort is not robust as per intention-to-treat principle.

Foster et al. reported 5.4% within the first 6 months of starting DAA therapy, whereas Cheung analysis started at the end of treatment and not at DAA initiation.

Finally, Romano et al.41 reported an incidence of 0.97 per 100 person-years (95% CI 0.73–1.26) but 24.5% of the patients were F3 and the rest Child-Pugh A (61%) or B (9%).

Thus, the incidence appears higher than expected.

Several confounders such as the absence of proper HCC screening prior to DAA, advanced liver disease with already known increased HCC risk or existing comorbidities such as alcohol intake, smoking or metabolic syndrome may affect all investigations.

Thus, it is key to design prospective investigations where all these confounders are properly assessed.

Until such detailed investigations are in place the controversy regarding the association between DAA therapy and HCC detection will not be over.

Some may argue that a randomized controlled trial would be the sole approach able to provide a final answer, but this is currently seen as unfeasible and we will have to rely on additional robust observational studies involving a large number of patients.
