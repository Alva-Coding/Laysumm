TITLE

Change in hepatic fat content measured by MRI does not predict treatment-induced histological improvement of steatohepatitis

PARAGRAPH

Quantification of liver fat by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently used to assess treatment responses in patients with fatty liver, with the assumption that improvements in liver fat translate into less inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis in the liver.

However, in this article, we showed that changes in liver fat do not necessarily translate into changes in these parameters.

This means that MRI may not be as useful to assess treatment response in patients with fatty liver as previously believed.
