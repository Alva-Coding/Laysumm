TITLE

HEV-positive blood donations represent a relevant infection risk for immunosuppressed recipients

PARAGRAPH

The relevance of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis E virus infections has been discussed controversially.

Herein, we present the first report on routine hepatitis E virus screening of blood donations at a tertiary care centre in Germany.

Hepatitis E viraemia was found at a relatively high rate of 0.12% among blood donors, which represents a relevant transfusion-related risk for vulnerable patient populations.
