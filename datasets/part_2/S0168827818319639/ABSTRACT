TITLE

Quantitation of HBV cccDNA in anti-HBc-positive liver donors by droplet digital PCR: A new tool to detect occult infection

PARAGRAPH

The accurate diagnosis of occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (OBI) requires the demonstration of HBV DNA in liver biopsies of hepatitis B surface antigen-negative individuals.

However, in clinical practice a latent OBI is deduced by the finding of the antibody to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc).

We investigated the true prevalence of OBI and the molecular features of intrahepatic HBV in anti-HBc-positive individuals.

PARAGRAPH

The livers of 100 transplant donors (median age 68.2 years; 64 males, 36 females) positive for anti-HBc at standard serologic testing, were examined for total HBV DNA by nested-PCR and for the HBV covalently closed circular DNA (HBV cccDNA) with an in-house droplet digital PCR assay (ddPCR) (Linearity: R2 = 0.9998; lower limit of quantitation and detection of 2.4 and 0.8 copies/105 cells, respectively).

PARAGRAPH

A total of 52% (52/100) of the individuals studied were found to have OBI.

cccDNA was found in 52% (27/52) of the OBI-positive, with a median 13 copies/105 cells (95% CI 5–25).

Using an assay specific for anti-HBc of IgG class, the median antibody level was significantly higher in HBV cccDNA-positive than negative donors (17.0 [7.0–39.2] vs. 5.7 [3.6–9.7] cut-off index [COI], respectively, p = 0.007).

By multivariate analysis, an anti-HBc IgG value above 4.4 COI was associated with the finding of intrahepatic HBV cccDNA (odds ratio 8.516, p = 0.009); a lower value ruled out its presence with a negative predictive value of 94.6%.

PARAGRAPH

With a new in-house ddPCR-based method, intrahepatic HBV cccDNA was detectable in quantifiable levels in about half of the OBI cases examined.

The titer of anti-HBc IgG may be a useful surrogate to predict the risk of OBI reactivation in immunosuppressed patients.
