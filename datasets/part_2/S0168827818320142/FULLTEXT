TITLE

CD36 palmitoylation disrupts free fatty acid metabolism and promotes tissue inflammation in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) describes a range of conditions caused by the accumulation of fat in hepatocytes.

Fifteen percent to 30% of the general population in both the Western world and Asia suffer from NAFLD.1,2

The prevalence is increased in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (70%) and morbid obesity (90%).3

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a subset of NAFLD characterized by excessive fat accumulation in hepatocytes (steatosis) associated with liver tissue inflammation.

Unlike steatosis alone (simple steatosis [SS]), which is generally considered benign and reversible, NASH may progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.4,5

Approximately 2–3% of the global population is thought to have NASH, tending to rise rapidly along with the incidence of obesity, T2DM and the metabolic syndrome.6,7

The pathogenesis of NASH appears complex and it is still poorly understood, hence there are no specific therapeutic strategies for NASH.

PARAGRAPH

Fatty acid translocase CD36 (CD36) is a widely expressed membrane glycoprotein, which plays an important role in facilitating the uptake and intracellular trafficking of long-chain fatty acid (LCFA).8,9

Growing evidence indicates that the role played by CD36 extends far beyond the transport of fatty acids (FAs).

Indeed, CD36 also impacts FA oxidation by influencing the activation of monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK).10

More importantly, CD36 is engaged in the regulation of chronic metabolic inflammation.

Stewart et al. reported that CD36 ligands (oxidized low-density lipoprotein and amyloid-beta) are able to trigger inflammatory signaling through the assembly of a complex of CD36 and toll-like receptors 4/6.11,12

CD36 deletion markedly reduced adipocyte inflammation in mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) by inhibiting the c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway.13

Accordingly, CD36 has been recognized as a multifunctional immuno-metabolic receptor.14

PARAGRAPH

Hepatic CD36 expression is normally weak, but its expression is significantly increased in animal models and patients with steatosis.15,16

Hepatic overexpression (OE) of CD36 results in steatosis in mice even in the absence of a HFD,17 and liver-specific knockout (KO) of CD36 reduces liver lipid content when mice were fed with HFD.18

However, little is known about the role of CD36 in NASH.

PARAGRAPH

It is well-established that the functions of CD36 are largely dependent on its localization on the plasma membrane.19

Insulin and the forkhead transcription factor FoxO1 induce CD36 translocation from intracellular deposits to the plasma membrane, facilitating FA uptake.20

However, the mechanisms regulating CD36 localization on the plasma membrane remain poorly understood.

PARAGRAPH

Palmitoylation is the covalent attachment of palmitate to cystein residues of proteins.

This post-translational modification increases the lipophilicity of the modified protein, thus regulating its subcellular distribution and function.21

It has been confirmed that human CD36 is palmitoylated, cysteines residues (cys) 3, 7, 464, and 466 account for the entire palmitoylation of CD36.22

Inhibition of palmitoylation causes ER accumulation of CD36 and decreases its incorporation into plasma membrane rafts, thus reducing the efficiency of uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein in melanoma cell lines.23

PARAGRAPH

The functional consequences of palmitoylation of CD36 within the liver and its role in NASH have never been addressed.

In the present study, we demonstrated that the localization of CD36 on the plasma membrane of hepatocytes was significantly increased in patients with NASH and we provide detailed mechanistic insights on the role of CD36 palmitoylation in the pathogenesis of NASH in a HFD-induced NASH mice model.

The results of the study suggest that CD36 palmitoylation represents a pathogenic link between FA metabolic dysfunction and liver tissue inflammation in NASH.

The study included 79 non-diabetic liver tissue biopsy samples obtained from the Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (CQMU) (9 patients) and Xinhua Hospital of Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine (SJTUSM) (10 patients), China and from the Royal Free Hospital (60 patients), United Kingdom.

The liver samples were obtained either by liver biopsy for diagnostic purposes or from surgical liver resections.

All patients provided written informed consent for their tissue to be analyzed for research purposes.

The study was approved by the Hospital Ethics Committees of CQMU, SJTUSM and the Royal Free Hospital.

The main inclusion criteria were daily alcohol consumption <20 g, negative tests for viral infections (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus) or other causes of acute or chronic liver diseases.

Tissue sections were reviewed by liver pathologists in Chongqing Medical University and the Royal Free Hospital, and classified/subdivided into four groups: normal liver (NL) (n = 20), SS (n = 19), NASH (n = 21) and cirrhosis (n = 19).

Histology, oil red O, Sirius red staining

PARAGRAPH

Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were routinely stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) using standard protocols.

Staining with Sirius red was performed for visualizing liver tissue fibrosis.

For Sirius red staining, sections were stained for 90 min with Direct Red 80 dye (Sigma Aldrich).

All images were captured using a Zeiss microscope.

Image analysis procedures were performed with Image J software.

The percentage of liver tissue area occupied by fatty hepatocytes or Sirius red-positive area was obtained from six different fields in each sample.

The average values were considered as hepatic steatosis index and fibrosis index.

Plasmid, lentivirus production and stable cell lines

PARAGRAPH

The mammalian expression plasmid PCI-CD36 encoding wild-type human CD36 full-length cDNA was kindly provided by Kenneth J. Linton (Queen Mary, University of London).

A CD36 variant was generated using PCI-CD36 as a template and the mutation primers (Table S1) with a multiple site-directed mutagenesis Kit (QuickChange II XL, Agilent Technologies), in which the cysteine ([Cys]-3, 7) of wild-type CD36 were replaced with alanine, and the residues towards the carboxyl terminus (Cys-464, 466) were replaced with serine (Fig. S2A).

The lentivirus constructs including GV341 empty vector (negative control [NC]-vector), GV341 containing wild-type CD36 (wt-CD36), palmitoylation site-mutated CD36 (AA-SS CD36) were provided by Shanghai GeneChem Company.

HepG2 cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 and stable transfectants were selected with puromycin (Shanghai Sangon) and named as NC-HepG2, wt-CD36-HepG2, and AA-SS-HepG2, respectively.

Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed with a HFD, (n = 6) or normal chow diet (NCD) (n = 6) for 22 weeks (research diets 12492, 12109B).

The CD36 knockout mice (CD36KO) were kindly provide by Maria Febbraio (University of Alberta, Edmonton AB, Canada).

In some experiments, the 8-week-old male CD36KO mice were injected with NC lentivirus vectors (n = 6), wt-CD36 lentivirus vectors (n = 6) and AA-SS lentivirus vectors (n = 6) in the tail vein and kept on HFD for eight weeks.

All mice were housed in a temperature-controlled environment and 12 h, 12 h light: dark cycle with free access to diet and water.

Before sacrifice, mice were fasted overnight.

The animal treatment conformed to the guidelines of The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Chongqing Medical University.

Before sacrifice, mice were deprived of food overnight with free access to water.

The contents of free fatty acid (FFA) in mice serum were analyzed by an automatic biochemistry analyzer.

All mouse care and experimental procedures were previously approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Chongqing Medical University, and the investigation conforms with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996).

Hepatic lipids were extracted from livers using a mixture of chloroform and methanol.

The contents of hepatic triglyceride (TG) were measured by a commercial kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering) and normalized by tissue weight.

SECTION

Analysis of mRNA expression

PARAGRAPH

Total RNA was reverse transcribed using MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems).

cDNA (25 ng) was used with 0.25 μM target (TNFα [Tnf], IL-6 [Il6], MCP1 [Ccl2], Col I [Col1a1], TGFβ [Tgfb1]) or control (36B4 [Rplp0] or β-actin [Actb]) (Table S2).

Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using a CFX Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad).

SECTION

Western blots and co-immunoprecipitations

PARAGRAPH

Tissues extracts and cells were lysed using radioimmuno-precipitation buffer.

For Western blotting analysis, equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electro-transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore).

Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies, subsequently being incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies.

For immunoprecipitation (IP), equal amounts of lysate proteins were incubated (4 °C) with antibodies overnight before adding protein A/G magnetic beads (Millipore) (1–3 h).

Bound proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer, and cleared supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE.

Detection was performed with the Protein Detection System (Fusion FX5) and ECL Plus reagent (Amersham).

The band intensity was analyzed by densitometry software (Image J).

SECTION

Detection of CD36 protein palmitoylation

PARAGRAPH

Protein palmitoylation was assessed by IP and acyl-biotin exchange (IP-ABE) as previously described.24

Briefly, total protein was extracted using a lysis buffer with protease inhibitors and N-ethylmaleimide.

After precipitating CD36 protein with anti-CD36body (Novus) and magnetic beads (Millipore), samples were re-suspended with stringent buffer.

Added 0.5 ml/sample of lysis buffer pH 7.2 to all hydroxylamine (HAM) samples, and 0.5 ml/sample of HAM buffer to all +HAM samples.

All samples were rotated at room temperature for 50 min.

Then samples were added with Biotin-BMCC buffer, and rotated for 50 min at 4 °C Proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in sample buffer and the cleared supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electro-transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore).

For detecting palmitoylated CD36, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-streptavidin for 1 h at 37 °C.

For detecting total CD36, membranes were incubated with anti-CD36 (Novus) and subsequent HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Zsbio).

SECTION

NF-κB activity assay

PARAGRAPH

Cells were transfected with an NF-κB response element–luciferase reporter gene and reporter gene activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase Assay Reporter System (Promega) as previously described.11

SECTION

Bioinformatic analysis

PARAGRAPH

Palmitate is an LCFA with 16-carbon atoms and with few polar atoms, so palmitoylation can be estimated as four lysines replaced on the original cysteine residues (palmitoylated and non-palmitoylated CD36 amino sequences are listed in (Table S3).

PARAGRAPH

The 36 amino acids of protein N-terminal and C-terminal is predicted by the method of tree threader calculation (http://protein.ict.ac.cn/TreeThreader/, Bioinformatics lab, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences).

The protein hydrophobic and hydrophilic model is shown by Chimera (http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/).

The hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are red and blue, respectively.

The hydropathy values of amino acids in wt-CD36 and AA-SS CD36 were acquired using online software (http://web.expasy.org/protparam/).

The grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) of wt-CD36 and AA-SS CD36 was calculated as the sum of hydropathy values of all amino acids divided by the numbers of residues in the sequence.

The accessible molecular surface was calculated using the ‘What If program’ (http://swift.cmbi.ru.nl/servers/html/index.html).

SECTION

Isolation and analysis of cellular plasma membrane fractions

PARAGRAPH

The cellular plasma membrane was isolated using a commercial Kit (Abcam) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

Briefly, cells (wet weight about 0.2–1.0 g) were collected and homogenized in Homogenize Buffer Mix.

The homogenate was then centrifuged at 700g for 10 min to remove the nuclear pellet.

The supernatant from the original 700g spin was centrifuged at 10,000g for 30 min at 4 °C.

The supernatant was collected and designated “cytoplasm extracts”.

The pellet was re-suspended in Upper and Lower Phase solution to separate plasma membrane fractions from cellular organelle membrane.

The suspension was mixed thoroughly and centrifuged at 1,000g for 10 min at 4 °C.

Upper Phase solution was collected and diluted with five volumes of water.

Then the mixture was centrifuged at 14,000g at 4 °C for 20 min.

The plasma membrane fraction pellet was dissolved in 0.5% Triton X-100.

SECTION

Isolation and analysis of detergent-resistant membranes

PARAGRAPH

Plasma membrane lipid rafts were identified as detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) and were obtained by floatation on sucrose density gradients by ultracentrifugation of Triton X-100 lysates as previously described.25

The partitioning of CD36 to the DRM and non-DRMs fractions was determined using Image J software.

SECTION

Flow cytometry

PARAGRAPH

Cells were fixed and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin prior to labeling by direct immunofluorescence using PE-conjugated CD36 antibody (Millipore).

Then cellular CD36 expression was examined by a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson).

SECTION

Bivariate analysis of LCFA binding or uptake

PARAGRAPH

FL labeled palmitate (FL-C16, Invitrogen) was incubated with the HepG2 cells for 0.5 h (4 °C or LCFA binding and 37 °C for LCFA uptake).

Then cells were immuno-stained with anti-CD36-PE (Millipore) before data acquisition using a FACScan flow cytometer.

The data were exported and analyzed using a previously reported bivariate spreadsheet method26 with some modification.

Briefly, all cell event data were categorized according to the levels of expression of CD36 in SPSS software.

After excluding channels below three cell events, the mean and standard deviates of fluorescence values for ligand (FL-C16) were calculated for each receptor (CD36) level category.

Then these data were exported into EXCEL2007 and a Student's t test was performed to compare the binding/uptake of ligand for receptor categories displaying equivalent receptor expression between two groups.

The average of FL-C16 uptake vs. CD36 expression and statistical results were plotted using EXCEL.

SECTION

Measurements of O2 consumption

PARAGRAPH

A Seahorse Bioscience XF24 instrument was used to measure the rate of change of dissolved O2 in medium immediately surrounding cells cultured in 24-well plates.

The rates of O2 concentration were obtained from the slopes of concentration changes vs. time measured during serial 180-s plunge periods that were followed by 180-s mix and 120-s wait periods.

Various metabolic inhibitors (oligomycin, FCCP and R/A) were added via automatic injectors followed by periods of 180 s of mixing, 120 s of waiting and 180 s of measuring.

The capabilities of cellular FA oxidation (FAO) were measured by the difference between O2 consumption with and without palmitate substrates.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

The difference between two groups was statistically analyzed by Student’s t test.

The differences among three or more groups were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.

A p value of <0.05 was considered significant.

Results

SECTION

CD36 localization on the hepatocellular plasma membrane is significantly increased in patients with NASH

PARAGRAPH

Compared with the NL group, evident lipid droplets were observed in livers of the patients with SS (Fig. 1Aii), while steatosis was associated with evident inflammatory cell infiltration in liver sections from patients with NASH (Fig. 1Aiii).

A hepatic steatosis index was evaluated by measuring the percentage of the liver tissue area occupied by fatty hepatocytes, as described in Methods.

As shown in Fig. 1B, the hepatic steatosis index was similar in patients with SS and NASH and was significantly higher than in NL and cirrhotic patients.

Conversely, both Sirius red staining and the hepatic fibrosis index were significantly higher in patients with NASH and cirrhosis (Fig. 1C and D).

PARAGRAPH

As β-catenin is localized on the hepatocyte plasma membrane, we next investigated CD36 distribution on the plasma membrane of hepatocytes in samples of NL, as well as from patients with different stages of NAFLD (SS, NASH and cirrhosis), using a dual-staining of CD36 and β-catenin.

The CD36 expression was weak in the liver samples from individuals with NLs (Fig. 1Ev), but it was increased in the patients with SS (Fig. 1E vi) and NASH (Fig. 1E vii), and became weak again in cirrhotic patients (Fig. 1E viii).

More importantly, the localization of CD36 on hepatocytes’ plasma membrane was significantly increased in patients with NASH (Fig. 1E xi and xv).

We further quantified the colocalization efficiency of CD36 and β-catenin in this group of patients.

As shown (Fig. 1F), the Pearson’s correlation (R value of CD36 and β-catenin staining) was higher in patients with SS than in those with NL and was highest in patients with NASH, suggesting that the localization of CD36 on the plasma membrane of hepatocytes is positively correlated with the evolution from NL to SS and to NASH.

Notably, the R value was lower in cirrhosis than with NASH, which may be because of a massive loss of hepatocytes in cirrhotic livers (Fig. 1F).

The colocalization rate was also significantly increased in the patients with NASH compared to those with NL or SS or cirrhosis (Fig. 1G).

These findings further support that CD36 localization on the plasma membrane of hepatocytes is associated with the development of NASH.

SECTION

CD36 palmitoylation is induced in the liver of mice with NASH

PARAGRAPH

Since palmitoylation is closely related to the translocation of membrane protein from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane, we investigated the role of hepatic CD36 expression and palmitoylation in a mouse model of NASH.

After 22 weeks of feeding with a HFD (Fig. 2A), C57BL/6 J mice developed a typical hepatocellular ballooning (Fig. 2A ii, iv), lobular inflammation (Fig. 2A ii) and moderate fibrosis (Fig. 2A vi).

Hepatic steatosis and fibrosis indexes and TNFα expression were all significantly increased in livers of mice with HFD (Fig. 2B and C).

Thus, long-term HFD feeding induced NASH in C57BL/6 J mice.

Western blot analysis demonstrated that CD36 protein levels were higher in the livers of mice with NASH when compared to NCD mice (Fig. 2D).

Next we analyzed the localization of CD36 on the plasma membrane of mouse hepatocytes.

Hepatic CD36 expression was more evident in mice with NASH (Fig. 2E iv) than in mice with normal livers (Fig. 2E iii).

The colocalization of CD36 and β-catenin was also significantly increased in mice with NASH (Fig. 2E, F), in agreement with our finding in patients with NASH.

PARAGRAPH

The palmitoylation of hepatic CD36 in HFD mice vs. NCD mice was then further investigated by an IP-ABE method (Fig. 2G).

The results of IP-ABE indicated that palmitoylated CD36 protein was significantly increased in the livers of mice with NASH when compared to NCD mice.

PARAGRAPH

In HepG2 cells, palmitic acid (PA) dose-dependently increased mRNA levels of CD36 (Fig. S1A).

PA also promoted the palmitoylation of CD36 in HepG2 cells (Fig. S1B).

In addition, the FFA contents in serum were significantly increased in mice with HFD than in mice with NCD (Fig. S1C), suggesting that PA, which is the most abundant FFA in hyperlipidemic serum, contribute to the increased palmitoylation of CD36 in the liver.

SECTION

Inhibition of CD36 palmitoylation protects mice from NASH

PARAGRAPH

To further identify the role of CD36 palmitoylation in NASH, we constructed lentiviral vectors expressing wt-CD36 and AA-SS CD36 and validated them in HepG2 cells.

CD36 expression was increased in both wt-CD36-HepG2 and AA-SS-HepG2 cells (Fig. S2B).

Palmitoylated CD36 levels were significantly higher in wt-CD36-HepG2 cells than in NC-HepG2 cells.

In contrast, the levels of palmitoylated CD36 to total CD36 in AA-SS-HepG2 cells were almost equal to NC-HepG2 cells (Fig. S2C).

PARAGRAPH

Next, we injected CD36KO mice with lentivirus vectors to express wt-CD36 and AA-SS CD36.

As endogenous CD36 was absent in this model, its effects were excluded.

As shown (Fig. 3A), CD36 protein was absent in the livers of CD36KO-NC mice, while it was significantly increased in hepatocytes of CD36KO-wt-CD36 and CD36KO-AA-SS mice (Fig. 3A iv, v, vi).

These findings were consistent with the results from western blotting of CD36 in mice livers (Fig. S2D).

The distribution of CD36 on hepatocyte plasma membranes was more evident in wt-CD36 OE mice livers (Fig. 3A xi) than in NC (Fig. 3A x) and in AA-SS CD36 OE mice livers (Fig. 3A xii).

As CD36 was absent in the NC group, the Pearson’s correlation and colocalization rate were lowest in the NC group compared to the wt-CD36 and AA-SS groups (Fig. 3B and C).

The Pearson’s correlation and colocalization rate were higher in the wt-CD36 group than in the AA-SS groups.

PARAGRAPH

When compared with CD36KO-NC mice, evident inflammatory cell infiltration (Fig. 3D ii), more abundant lipid droplets (Fig. 3D, v) and mild tissue fibrosis (Fig. 3D viii) were observed in the livers of CD36KO-wt-CD36 mice.

Interestingly, hepatic steatosis with inflammation and fibrosis were decreased in the CD36KO-AA-SS mice (Fig. 3D iii, vi, ix), compared with CD36KO-wt-CD36 mice (Fig. 3D ii, v, viii).

The TG quantitative data also showed that hepatic content of TG in CD36KO-wt-CD36 mice was significantly higher than in CD36KO-NC and CD36KO-AA-SS mice (Fig. 3E).

The hepatic mRNA levels of cytokines/chemokine (TNFα, IL-6 and MCP1) and fibrosis markers (Col I [Col1a1] and TGFβ) were significantly increased in CD36KO-wt CD36 mice, whereas the expression of these genes was significantly reduced in the CD36KO-AA-SS mice (Fig. 3F and G).

These findings clearly demonstrated that CD36 palmitoylation represents a mechanistic step in the development of NASH.

SECTION

Inhibition of CD36 palmitoylation influences protein hydropathicity and its localization on the hepatocellular plasma membrane

PARAGRAPH

Based on the observation that inhibition of palmitoylation reduced the development of NASH, we then investigated the possible underlying mechanisms.

Using bioinformatics, we predicted the N-terminal and C-terminal 3D protein structures of palmitoylated CD36 and non-palmitoylated CD36.

The conformation of palmitoylated CD36 was clearly different from non-palmitoylated CD36 (Fig. S3).

We also calculated the hydropathic values of wt-CD36 (blue) and AA-SS CD36 protein (red) by the Kyte-Doolittle method (Fig. 4A).

The GRAVY was calculated as the sum of hydropathy values of all amino acids divided by the numbers of residues in the sequence.

An increasing positive score indicates greater hydrophobicity.

The GRAVY in wt-CD36 was 0.122 in comparison with 0.022 in AA-SS CD36 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that wt-CD36 has stronger hydrophobicity than AA-SS CD36.

Calculation of the accessible surface area confirmed that wt-CD36 had a much less hydropathic surface area than AA-SS CD36 (Fig. 4C).

Thus inhibition of palmitoylation increases hydropathicity of CD36, which may decrease the affinity of CD36 to the plasma membrane thus hindering CD36 translocation from intracellular pools to the cell membrane.27

PARAGRAPH

Next, we isolated the subcellular fractions to confirm the effects of palmitoylation on CD36 distribution on cell plasma membrane.

Flow cytometry results showed that total CD36 expression were significantly increased in wt-CD36-HepG2 and AA-SS-HepG2 cells compared to NC-HepG2 cells, and its expression was roughly equal in wt-CD36-HepG2 and AA-SS-HepG2 cells (Fig. 4D).

Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4E, a weaker CD36 plasma membrane signal contrasted with a stronger CD36 cytoplasm signal in AA-SS-HepG2, compared to wt-CD36-HepG2 cells.

PARAGRAPH

Given that the plasma lipid raft is an essential domain for CD36-mediated FA uptake,28 we further investigated the impact of inhibition of CD36 palmitoylation on its distribution in the lipid rafts of HepG2 cells.

DRM analysis revealed that CD36 from the wt-CD36-HepG2 was highly enriched within the visible floating band that also contained caveolin, a lipid raft marker, while CD36 in the AA-SS-HepG2 cells was less evident within the DRM fractions (Fig. 4F).

This pattern of distribution was confirmed to be statistically significant and consistent in different preparations (Fig. 4F).

SECTION

Inhibition of CD36 palmitoylation reduces LCFA binding/uptake and CD36/Fyn/Lyn complex formation in HepG2 cells

PARAGRAPH

As studies have identified CD36 as a key mediator of LCFA uptake,8,9 we next investigated whether the absence of CD36 palmitoylation inhibited LCFA binding or uptake in HepG2 cells.

A bivariate flow cytometric assay, a technique developed to overcome the bias of differences in receptor expression in cell based ligand binding/uptake assays, was applied to quantitatively examine the binding and uptake of LCFA in cells.

There was a significant decrease in the binding and uptake of LCFA, as reported by the fluorescent lipid analogue (FL-C16), in the AA-SS-HepG2 relative to the wt-CD36-HepG2 cells (Fig. 5A, B).

The inhibitor of palmitoylation, 2-bromopalmitate (2BP), also decreased LCFA binding and uptake in HepG2 cells (Fig. 5C, D).

PARAGRAPH

CD36 not only functions as an FA transporter but it also recruits the src family kinase Fyn and Lyn to assembly signaling protein complexes.10

We examined whether palmitoylation was involved in modulating CD36 association with Fyn and Lyn.

AA-SS mutation markedly decreased the amounts of Fyn and Lyn found in CD36 IP from OE HepG2 cells (Fig. 5E), suggesting a reduced CD36-Fyn/Lyn association.

These data support the hypothesis that inhibition of CD36 palmitoylation suppresses the formation of CD36/Fyn/Lyn complex.

SECTION

Inhibition of CD36 palmitoylation enhances FA β-oxidation by activating the AMPK pathway

PARAGRAPH

In patients with NAFLD, FA β-oxidation in hepatocytes is significantly decreased, contributing to the abnormal lipid accumulation.

Along these lines, we measured FA-driven oxygen consumption rate (OCR) (palmitate-dependent OCR) to assess the effects of CD36 palmitoylation on FAO.

As shown in Fig. 6A, the wt-CD36-HepG2 cells always had lower palmitate-dependent oxygen consumption vs. the NC-HepG2 cells.

The AA-SS-HepG2 cells always had higher palmitate-dependent oxygen consumption vs. wt-CD36-HepG2 cells, indicating the improved FAO in the former (Fig. 6B).

We also observed a marked increase of FAO in HepG2 treated with 2-BP when compared with cells without 2-BP (Fig. 6C).

Thus inhibition of CD36 palmitoylation in hepatocytes clearly correlated with the increased FAO.

PARAGRAPH

AMPK is a key regulator in the maintenance of cellular FA homeostasis,29 which controls FA β-oxidation in mitochondria.

Phosphorylation of AMPK was lower in the wt-CD36-HepG2 cells than in the NC-HepG2 cells (Fig. 6D), suggesting that CD36 overexpression inactivated the AMPK pathway.

Interestingly, the absence of CD36 palmitoylation increased phosphorylation of AMPK compared with wt-CD36 HepG2 cells (Fig. 6D).

2-BP, an inhibitor of palmitoylation also increased the phosphorylation of AMPK in HepG2 cells (Fig. 6E).

These findings suggested that inhibition of CD36 palmitoylation results in the activation of the AMPK pathway.

PARAGRAPH

Furthermore, compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK, was applied to test whether the activation of AMPK contributed to the enhanced FAO in AA-SS-HepG2 cells.

Both basal FAO (palmitate-dependent OCR before oligomycin treatment) and max FAO (palmitate-dependent OCR in response to uncoupling agent, FCCP) were significantly decreased in compound C-treated AA-SS-HepG2 cells, compared with untreated cells (Fig. 6F).

Moreover, we found that, while in the absence of compound C, lipid accumulation is less evident in AA-SS-HepG2 than in wt-CD36-HepG2 cells; the amount of lipid droplets became equally evident in wt-CD36-HepG2 and in AA-SS-HepG2 cells in the presence of compound C (Fig. 6G).

We also tested the effects of compound C on 2BP-treated HepG2 cells.

In the absence of compound C, 2BP significantly inhibited palmitate-induced lipid droplets accumulation (Fig. 6H,I).

However, in the presence of compound C, the numbers of lipid droplets in 2BP-treated cells were significantly increased reaching equal levels of palmitate-treated HepG2 cells.

Thus, inhibition of CD36 palmitoylation enhanced FAO via activation of AMPK, resulting in reduced intracellular lipid accumulation in hepatocytes.

SECTION

Inhibition of palmitoylation reduces inflammation via inhibiting the JNK pathway

PARAGRAPH

CD36 not only regulates FA metabolism, but also modulates the inflammatory response.

While the NF-κB activities were higher in the wt-CD36-HepG2 than in the NC-HepG2 cells, there was no difference between AA-SS-HepG2 and NC-HepG2 cells (Fig. 7A).

TNFα protein levels were consistently higher in wt-CD36-HepG2 than in NC-HepG2 cells; TNFα expression was significantly lower in the AA-SS-HepG2 than in wt-CD36-HepG2 cells (Fig. 7B).

TNFα expression was also reduced in 2BP-treated HepG2 cells (Fig. 7C).

These findings demonstrated that CD36 palmitoylation plays an important role in mediating the inflammatory response.

The JNK contributes to steatohepatitis and fibrosis.30

Following treatment with SP600125, an inhibitor of JNK signaling pathway, TNFα expression was not increased in the wt-CD36-HepG2 cells (Fig. 7D).

Thus JNK signaling pathway is a critical determinant of CD36-mediated inflammatory response.

PARAGRAPH

We next examined whether the palmitoylation of CD36 influenced the activation of JNK signaling pathway.

Phosphorylated JNK was significantly increased in wt-CD36-HepG2 compared to NC-HepG2 cells and AA-SS mutation markedly decreased the amounts of phosphorylated JNK, compared with wt-CD36-HepG2 cells (Fig. 7E).

The reduced phosphorylation of JNK was also observed in 2-BP-treated HepG2 cells (Fig. 7F).

Thus inhibition of CD36 palmitoylation inactivated JNK signaling pathway, reducing liver tissue inflammation.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Lipid accumulation and tissue inflammation are key features of NASH.

However, the pathogenic cross-roads linking FA metabolism, lipotoxicity and hepatic inflammation/fibrogenesis remain unclear.

CD36 is a widely expressed membrane glycoprotein playing an important role in modulating FA uptake and FA β-oxidation, contributing to the maintenance of cellular FA homeostasis.10,31

In addition, CD36 regulates a downstream pathway modulating NF-κB activity which activates cellular inflammatory response.11,12

In these terms, CD36 represents a crucial link between FA metabolic dysregulation and inflammation, which synergistically contributes to the development of NASH.

PARAGRAPH

Previously, the potential role of CD36 in the pathogenesis of human NAFLD was suggested by the study of Miquilena-Colina et al., showing that CD36 is overexpressed and associated with insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and increased steatosis in patients with NAFLD and HCV with fatty liver.32

In the present study, we confirmed that CD36 expression increased with evolution from normal liver to SS and further development to NASH.

Since CD36 is widely expressed in many cell types, including monocytes, macrophages and hepatocytes,33 we characterized CD36 distribution on the hepatocellular plasma membrane using co-immunofluorescent staining of CD36 and β-catenin, a hepatocyte plasma membranes marker.

Our results show that the distribution of CD36 on the plasma membrane of hepatocytes is remarkably increased in patients with NASH compared with those with SS and cirrhosis, suggesting that the increased localization of CD36 on hepatocyte plasma membranes may represent a key feature in the development of NASH.

PARAGRAPH

The evident plasma membrane localization of CD36 found in patients with NASH prompted the investigation of the possible mechanism(s) regulating the distribution of this protein.

Previous studies demonstrated that insulin increases CD36 palmitoylation and rapidly stimulates the surface expression of CD36 in muscle cells.34,35

In addition, Thorne et al. consistently found that palmitoylation is necessary for the efficient incorporation of CD36 into plasma membrane rafts in melanoma cells.23

Therefore, the role of CD36 palmitoylation in the development of NASH was investigated in the present study.

We examined the levels of palmitoylation of CD36 in livers of mice with NASH.

Hepatic palmitoylated CD36 was significantly increased in mice with NASH, with demonstrable hepatocyte plasma membranes expression, in agreement with the findings obtained in patients with NASH.

It is conceivable that palmitoylation enhances the hydrophobicity of CD36, thus increasing its distribution in hepatocellular plasma membrane rafts, a special lipid-rich plasma membrane microdomains facilitating FA take and interactions between proteins.19,21,27,36

PARAGRAPH

Consequently, the palmitoylated CD36 on the hepatic plasma membrane mediates FA uptake and enhances the formation of the CD36/Lyn/Fyn complex with the consequent activation of an inflammatory cascade, which distinguishes NASH from SS.

Accordingly, inhibition of CD36 palmitoylation leads to the inactivation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, followed by reduced inflammatory reaction both in vivo and in vitro.

JNK plays an important role in the development of NASH.

Deletion of JNK diminishes hepatic inflammation induced by a high-fat diet and a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet, respectively in mice.37,38

The activation of JNK in response to multiple stresses mediates inflammation through activator protein-1–dependent transcription of proinflammatory cytokines.30

CD36 recruits the src kinase Lyn, which phosphorylates and activates JNK, contributing to adipose tissues inflammation.39

The interaction between CD36 and src kinase Lyn required the MISY motif on 460–463 amino acids residues of C-terminus of CD36,11 which is near to the palmitoylation sites on the C-terminus of CD36 (residues 464 and 466).

In this study, we show that the absence of CD36 palmitoylation significantly decreases the interaction between CD36 and Lyn, resulting in reduced JNK activation and inflammatory responses.

Since inflammatory stress affects multiple steps in FA metabolism, resulting in hepatic steatosis,40 the attenuated inflammation may also contribute to the reduced lipid accumulation in the liver.

PARAGRAPH

Interestingly, inhibition of CD36 palmitoylation, either by mutations of palmitoylation sites (AA-SS) of CD36 or pharmacological agent, inhibited FA binding, uptake and an inflammatory response.

In the present study, the specific role of CD36 palmitoylation was identified by the mutation on CD36 palmitoylation sites.

wt-CD36 overexpression caused steatosis and inflammation in mice livers, while mice bearing the palmitoylation sites mutated CD36 did not develop NASH.

2-BP, which is not a specific inhibitor of CD36 palmitoylation, although widely used to test the general role of palmitoylation of protein,23 prevented the development of hepatic steatosis.

Accordingly, more specific inhibitors of CD36 palmitoylation should be considered in future studies for the treatment/prevention of NASH.

PARAGRAPH

The excess of lipids in hepatic steatosis is mainly constituted by TG, which are stored in cytoplasmic lipid droplets.41

Excessive influx of FA from the circulation to the liver is normally handled by FA β-oxidation.

However, lipid overload particularly in the presence of tissue inflammation leads to the impairment of FA β-oxidation, as shown in this study, and leads to the worsening of steatosis.

AMPK plays an important role in maintaining energy homeostasis and may have therapeutic importance for treating obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and hepatic steatosis.42

AMPK is normally quiescent, and it is phosphorylated and activated in response to energy stresses, leading to a decrease in ATP-consuming pathways and an increase in ATP-producing pathways.

Liver-specific activation of AMPK completely protects mice against high-fructose diet-induced hepatic steatosis.43

Hepatic activation of AMPK has been reported to promote FAO via phosphorylation and inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, reducing levels of the β-oxidation inhibitor malonyl-CoA.44

Previous studies have demonstrated that CD36 is presented in a protein complex with the AMPK kinase LKB1 (liver kinase B1) and the src kinase Fyn.10

Wt-CD36 overexpression promotes Fyn mediated LKB1 phosphorylation and its nuclear sequestration, hindering LKB1 mediated phosphorylation and activation of AMPK.45

Consistent with this, we found that palmitoylation of CD36 is associated with a low AMPK activity, accompanying a low hepatic FA β-oxidation, which may also result from the increased LKB1 phosphorylation, a negative regulator of AMPK.

Conversely, AMPK phosphorylation was enhanced by inhibition of CD36 palmitoylation, either by mutations of palmitoylation sites (AA-SS) of CD36 or pharmacological agents 2BP in HepG2 cells.

This could be caused by a reduction in the amount of CD36/Fyn complex on the hepatic plasma membrane.

Therefore, our results suggest that increased palmitoylation of CD36 may impair FA β-oxidation and that inhibition of CD36 palmitoylation may activate AMPK in a Fyn-LKB1 manner, improving FA β-oxidation and preventing steatosis.

PARAGRAPH

On the basis of our findings, we postulate that enhanced CD36 palmitoylation, which occurred in the presence of a high-fat diet, promotes CD36 translocation to the plasma membrane of hepatocytes, facilitating LCFA binding/uptake and CD36/Fyn/Lyn complex formation.

The imbalance between FA uptake and consumption (FAO), as well as activation of the inflammatory response, contributes to the development of NASH.

Prevention of palmitoylation hinders CD36 in the cytoplasm, which reduces lipid uptake, inhibits inflammatory responses by inhibition of JNK signaling pathway and improves FA β-oxidation by activation of AMPK signaling pathway with an overall amelioration of NASH (Fig. 8).

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, the present study provides sound evidence that distribution of CD36 on cellular plasma membrane, rather than simply its level of expression, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of NASH.

As palmitoylation controls the distribution and functions of CD36, targeting the palmitoylation sites of CD36 may offer a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NASH and its progression to advanced chronic liver disease.
