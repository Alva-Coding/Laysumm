TITLE

18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) for patients with biliary tract cancer: Systematic review and meta-analysis

PARAGRAPH

A positron emission tomography (PET scan), using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG), can help doctors identify areas of cancer in the body by highlighting “hot spots”.

These hotspots may be cancerous (true positive) but may also be non-cancerous, like inflammation (false positive).

We show that PET scans are useful to assess how far advanced the cancer is (by assessing spread to lymph glands and to other organs) and also to identify if the cancer has recurred (for example after surgery), thus helping doctors to make treatment decisions.

However, a biopsy is still needed for the initial diagnosis of a biliary tract cancer, because of the high chance of a “false positive” with PET scans.
