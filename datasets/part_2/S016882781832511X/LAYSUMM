TITLE

Multidrug-resistant bacterial infections in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and with acute-on-chronic liver failure in Europe

PARAGRAPH

Infections caused by bacteria resistant to the main antibiotic families are prevalent in patients with cirrhosis.

This study demonstrates that this healthcare problem is increasing and extends through all European regions.

Infections caused by these difficult to treat bacteria resolve less frequently and often cause the death of the patient.

The type of resistant bacteria varies markedly among different hospitals.
