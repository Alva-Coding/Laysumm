TITLE

B cell immunodominance in primary hepatitis C virus infection

PARAGRAPH

Neutralising antibodies will likely form a key component of a protective hepatitis C virus vaccine.

In this work we characterise the predominant neutralising and non-neutralising antibody (epitope) targets in acute hepatitis C virus infection.

We have defined the natural hierarchy of epitope immunodominance, and demonstrated that viral genotype can impact on this hierarchy.

Our findings highlight key epitopes that are associated with broadly neutralising antibodies, and the deleterious impact of mounting a response towards some of these domains on neutralising breadth.

These findings should guide future efforts to design immunogens aimed at generating neutralising antibodies with a vaccine candidate.
