TITLE

Hepatocyte-specific deletion of IL1-RI attenuates liver injury by blocking IL-1 driven autoinflammation

PARAGRAPH

Acute liver injury which can cause lethal liver failure is medicated by a class of proteins called cytokines.

Among these, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and the corresponding receptor IL-1R1 play a prominent role in the immune system, but their role in the liver is undetermined.

In the current study, a novel mouse model with defective IL-1R1 in liver cells was studied.

Mice lacking this receptor in liver cells were protected from cell death to a certain extent.

This protection occurred only in the presence of other, neighboring cells, arguing for the involvement of proteins derived from these cells.

This effect is called paracrine signaling and the current study has for the first time shown that the IL-1R1 receptor on hepatocytes is involved in acute liver failure in this context.

The approved drug anakinra – which blocks IL-1R1 – had the same effect, supporting the proposed mechanism of action.

The findings of this study suggest new treatment options for patients with acute liver failure by blocking defined signals of the immune system.
