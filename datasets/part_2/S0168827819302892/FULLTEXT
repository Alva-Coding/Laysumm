TITLE

Pravastatin combination with sorafenib does not improve survival in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence is still growing in Western countries.1,2

Tumor development is frequently related to liver damage, typically caused by cirrhosis.

While curative treatments (transplantation, resection, percutaneous destruction) can be proposed for small tumors, about two-thirds of patients are not eligible for such treatments.3

PARAGRAPH

Sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets signaling pathways involved in tumor cell proliferation (Ras-Raf-MAPK) and intracellular angiogenesis (VEGF-R, PDGF-R, Ras), demonstrated its efficacy as a treatment for advanced HCC.

Two major randomized phase III trials showed that sorafenib significantly improved overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP) compared to placebo, especially in patients with Child-Pugh A liver function.4,5

Those results made sorafenib the standard of care for advanced HCC and led to its approval for this indication.

However, median OS remains limited to about 11 months; therefore, the question of combining sorafenib to another treatment in order to improve OS with an acceptable safety profile is highly relevant.

PARAGRAPH

Among potential substances that could be combined with sorafenib, statins are of particular interest because of their intrinsic action on HMG-CoA reductase, the concentration and the activity of which is increased in HCC cells.6

Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase leads to depletion of mevalonate and, thus, of its products, farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate used in the cell for post-translational modifications of many regulators of proliferation.

Moreover, the deregulation of cholesterol synthesis in HCC cells, particularly in mitochondria is implicated in their chemoresistance.7

Indeed, statins demonstrated antitumoral properties both experimentally and clinically, especially in digestive cancers.8–10

Pravastatin is one of the most widely studied statins.

It has been shown that pravastatin inhibits in vitro and in vivo HCC tumor growth, and has a pro-apoptotic action on tumoral liver cell lines.11,12

The antiproliferative activity is associated with a decrease in expression and activation of matrix metallopeptidase 2 and 9, which represents an original mechanism of action.13

Thus, the combination of pravastatin and sorafenib appears to be promising for HCC: action on tumor cell proliferation by acting on 1 of the 2 main signaling pathways (Raf-Ras-MAPK) through 2 distinct mechanisms, and anti-invasive and anti-metastatic action of pravastatin as a complement to the anti-angiogenic action of sorafenib.

PARAGRAPH

Beside biology, the potential HCC prevention effect of statin use was emphasized by a meta-analysis (adjusted odds ratio 0.63; 95% CI 0.52–0.76).14

PARAGRAPH

In the field of HCC, there were only 2 clinical studies about the therapeutic interest of pravastatin.

In a previous open-label trial published in 2001, 83 patients with advanced HCC, mostly Child-Pugh B, were treated by transarterial chemoembolization followed by fluoroacil for 2 months, then randomized to pravastatin or no added treatment.

The median OS was significantly improved in patients with pravastatin (18 months vs. 9 months in the control arm; p = 0.006).15

The second one, a randomized phase II trial conducted on 58 patients with advanced HCC, suggested that median OS was significantly longer for patients receiving pravastatin (7.2 months) than for patients receiving gemcitabine (3.5 months).16

PARAGRAPH

In terms of safety, pravastatin has a good liver safety profile, including in cirrhotic patients, with 0.6% of cytolysis exceeding 2× the upper limit of normal (ULN).17,18

Lastly, pravastatin metabolism is independent of CYP3A4, limiting drug interactions with sorafenib.

Thus, the combination of sorafenib with pravastatin seemed promising in the treatment of HCC because of complementary mechanisms of action and limited risks of interactions.

PARAGRAPH

The purpose of the PRODIGE-11 trial was to compare OS in Child-Pugh A HCC patients treated with a combination of sorafenib-pravastatin or sorafenib alone.

The secondary objectives were progression-free survival (PFS), TTP, time to treatment failure (TTF), safety, and baseline quality of life (QoL).

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Study population

PARAGRAPH

Patients of at least 18 with a histologically proven HCC.

If an histological exam was not feasible (ascites, coagulation disorders), the diagnosis could be made in cases of cirrhosis by identification of 1 liver focal lesion larger than 10 mm, either on the basis of 2 dynamic imaging techniques for tumors <2 cm, or on the basis of 1 dynamic imaging technique for tumors ≥2 cm (according to the European Association for the Study of the Liver/American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases 2005 criteria).

Patients had to be ineligible for curative treatment, chemoembolization, or have a progressing HCC after failure of a specific treatment.

Other criteria: CLIP score19 between 0–4, Child-Pugh score A, liver aminotransferases ≤5× ULN, blood creatinine ≤1.5× ULN, World Health Organization-performance status (WHO-PS) 0–2, life expectancy >12 weeks, and availability for regular follow-ups.

Patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist were eligible if no major coagulation disorder was diagnosed before the onset of the oral anticoagulant.

PARAGRAPH

The absence of consumption of any statin before inclusion in the study was carefully investigated by the practitioners.

PARAGRAPH

Patients were not eligible if they had a recent or present life-threatening extrahepatic disease, another progressing tumoral disease (except in situ uterine cervix carcinoma, superficial bladder cancer, treated basal cell carcinoma, or other cancer treated for more than 3 years), a cardiac disease (heart failure New York Heart Association class ≥2, uncontrolled hypertension or arrhythmia, myocardial infarct <6 months), digestive bleeding <1 month; pregnant or breast-feeding women were also excluded.

PARAGRAPH

Written informed consent was obtained before randomization.

The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (CCPPRB Est-1) and the study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and European Good Clinical Practice requirements.

The study was registered under the number NCT01075555.

SECTION

Treatment

PARAGRAPH

The treatment was started within 15 days after randomization.

Patients were assigned to receive oral sorafenib 400 mg twice daily combined with oral pravastatin (drug intake during the dinner) 40 mg per day (arm A), or oral sorafenib 400 mg twice daily (arm B).

Patients received the treatment until death or treatment discontinuation due to serious adverse events, patient refusal, or WHO-PS ≥3.

Isolated radiological progression, even with QoL improvement, was not considered a criterion for discontinuation.

The final decision was left to patient and/or investigator’s discretion.

Patients had access to any useful symptomatic treatment.

SECTION

Assessments

PARAGRAPH

Clinical examinations had to be performed 2 weeks before enrollment, consisting of identification by an individual number, disease history, cirrhosis etiology, weight, physical exam, WHO-PS, and QoL questionnaires (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer core quality of life questionnaire [QLQ-C30] and functional assessment of cancer therapy-hepatobiliary [FACT-HEP]).

Biological exams, performed 2 weeks before enrollment, consisted of: absolute blood count including platelets, prothrombin time, serum albumin, liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, blood creatinine, alpha-fetoprotein, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and creatine phosphokinase.

Hepatitis B virus antigens and hepatitis C virus antibodies had to be measured 3 months before enrollment, except in cases of a known previous infection.

Morphological exams, performed 1 month before enrollment, included imaging by thoraco-abdominal CT-scan, or abdominal MRI and thoracic CT-scan.

Tumor volume was defined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (or RECIST) criteria (version 1.1), and portal thrombosis (truncal or lobar) was explored.

PARAGRAPH

During treatment, a consultation was performed every 4 weeks taking into account the biological exams and the regular intake of sorafenib and pravastatin, which was assessed by questioning and examination of pill packets.

Every 12 weeks, an imaging identical to baseline was performed.

Safety was evaluated with the NCI-CTC v2.0 grade.

SECTION

Study design

PARAGRAPH

This trial was phase III, multicenter, open-label, controlled, and randomized.

The primary objective was to compare OS between patients receiving sorafenib-pravastatin versus sorafenib alone in Child-Pugh A patients with HCC.

Secondary comparisons included PFS, TTP, TTF, QoL, and safety.

Patients were randomized 1:1 using minimization technique, and stratified according to center, CLIP score (0 vs. 1 vs. 2–4), WHO-PS (0 vs. 1 vs. 2), and extrahepatic metastases.

SECTION

Sample size determination and statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

The primary endpoint was OS defined as time from randomization until death from any cause.

The trial was designed to detect an increase in median OS of 3.5 months (10 months with sorafenib alone; 13.5 months with sorafenib-pravastatin; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.74) with a power of 80% and a 2-sided type I error of 5%.

Scheduled inclusion level was 15 patients per month for 32 months.

The estimated rate of loss to follow-up was 5%.

These hypotheses required 474 patients to be enrolled for 360 events.

One interim analysis was prospectively planned when 180 deaths were registered to control combination safety and efficacy, using the alpha spending function and ranges defined in the O’Brien-Fleming method.20

Interim analysis was performed in October 2013 after 53% of expected deaths had occurred (i.e. 190 deaths and 281 recruited patients), indicating the superiority of one treatment arm over the other was uncertain.

Therefore, the recruitment was stopped in November 2013.

The present report reflects the final analysis after recruitment interruption.

PARAGRAPH

Secondary endpoints were PFS defined as time from randomization until first radiological and/or clinical progression or death (whatever the cause); TTP defined as time from randomization until first radiological and/or clinical progression according to physician assessment; and TTF defined as time from randomization until final treatment interruption.

PARAGRAPH

The intention-to-treat (ITT) population was defined as all enrolled patients irrespective of eligibility criteria and treatment.

The population assessable for safety was defined as patients who received 1 dose of study treatment.

Qualitative data were presented as a percentage and compared using chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test.

Quantitative data were described using mean, standard deviation, median and range, and were compared with Student or Wilcoxon tests.

Survival data were computed according to the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival curves were compared using the log-rank test.

Univariate Cox models were used to calculate the HR with 95% CI.

Proportional risks hypothesis was tested using the Schöenfeld residuals.

Cox regression methods were used to determine prognostic factors, and those with a p value <0.15 in univariate analyses were kept for multivariate analyses.

Median follow-up was calculated using the reverse Kaplan-Meier method.

PARAGRAPH

Compliance to sorafenib and pravastatin was calculated as the ratio of real dose (sum of the dose of each delivered tablet)/theoretical dose (sum of the dose of each scheduled tablet).

Results

SECTION

Demographics

PARAGRAPH

From March 2010 to November 2013, 323 patients were randomized in 61 centers: 162 in the sorafenib-pravastatin arm (arm A) and 161 in the sorafenib arm (arm B).

The study flow chart is presented in Fig. 1.

The main baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1.

Baseline characteristics were well-balanced between treatment arms, except for sex distribution with a higher rate of men in arm A (p = 0.01).

Overall, 274 patients (86.2%) had an associated cirrhosis, related to alcohol alone in 55.6% of cases, viral infection alone in 13.3% of cases, hemochromatosis alone in 3%, other cause in 11.5%, or combined etiology in 16.7%.

SECTION

Baseline quality of life

PARAGRAPH

QoL was assessed before the onset of treatment (Table 2, Table 3).

QoL items were well-balanced between treatment arms, except for diarrhea, which was more frequent in patients randomized in arm A (p = 0.004) and for hepatobiliary cancer subscale, which was higher in patients randomized in arm B (p = 0.04).

SECTION

Treatment

PARAGRAPH

After randomization, 312 patients received at least 1 dose of study treatment, 155 in arm A and 157 in arm B (Fig. 1).

Median duration of treatment was 4.1 months (range: 0.03–50.9) in arm A and 3.6 months (range: 0.07–48.4) in arm B, with no difference between both treatment arms (p = 0.38).

Median compliance to sorafenib was 91.5% in arm A, and 87.3% in arm B (p = 0.79).

Median compliance to pravastatin was 98.7% in arm A.

The main reason for treatment interruption was death.

SECTION

Survival analysis

PARAGRAPH

In November 2013, interim analysis showed that median OS was 9.5 months in arm A (95% CI 7.1–14.1) and 9.1 months in arm B (95% CI 6.4–11.8) (p = 0.69).

PARAGRAPH

Final analysis showed median follow-up of 34.7 months (95% CI 32.4–37.5) in arm A, and 36.1 months (95% CI 28.1–47.3) in arm B.

PARAGRAPH

The best tumor response was recorded in the ITT population, with at least 1 imaging assessment (n = 252; arm A = 127, arm B = 125; Table S1).

PARAGRAPH

Overall, 269 patients died (n = 135 in arm A, and n = 134 in arm B).

Deaths were related to disease progression, except for 3 patients who died from pulmonary infection (arm A), cholangiocarcinoma (arm A), and respiratory failure from choking (arm B); in 14 cases, the cause of death was unknown (arm A = 6: arm B = 8).

There was no difference in OS between treatment arms (Table 4, Fig. 2A).

In the univariate analysis, the significant prognostic factors for OS were CLIP score, WHO-PS, QLQ-C30 and FACT-HEP scores (Table 5).

Only the CLIP score remained significant in multivariate analysis (Table 5).

PARAGRAPH

Regarding secondary survival endpoints (PFS, TTP, and TTF), no statistically significant differences between treatment arms were observed (Table 4, Fig. 2B).

SECTION

Safety

PARAGRAPH

Toxicities occurring in more than 10% of patients, irrespective of severity, are presented in Table 6.

Among digestive toxicities, severe (grade 3–4) nausea-vomiting were rare (arm A: 1.9%; arm B: 3.2%); the main digestive toxicity was diarrhea with severe events occurring in 11% of patients in arm A, and 8.9% in arm B. No toxic event was fatal.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Based on a relevant rationale,7–14 the PRODIGE-11 randomized, phase III trial was the first to investigate the contribution of pravastatin combined with sorafenib to improve the survival of Child-Pugh A patients with HCC.

This study involved a representative medical community with university hospitals, regional hospitals, private hospitals, and anticancer centers.

Unfortunately, this study failed to demonstrate any improvement in OS, compared to sorafenib alone, as well as in secondary survival endpoints (PFS, TTP, and TTF).

Non-significant results of the interim analysis led to premature enrollment interruption.

These results are strongly negative without any methodological bias.

Negative results require us to review hypotheses that could explain our findings.

PARAGRAPH

We can reasonably exclude a negative interaction between sorafenib and pravastatin, as sorafenib and the combination provided similar results.

Moreover, metabolic pathways of pravastatin do not interfere with those of sorafenib.

The median OS and radiological PFS reported in the present study for sorafenib alone (10.5 months and 4.4 months, respectively) or sorafenib/pravastatin (10.7 months and 5.0 months, respectively) were close to those of the pivotal sorafenib trial (SHARP trial) with a median OS of 10.7 months and a median radiological PFS of 5.5 months.5

PARAGRAPH

The PRODIGE-11 trial demonstrated that the sorafenib-pravastatin combination did not bring an OS improvement in our study population.

Of course, it was not possible to evaluate the efficacy of pravastatin alone in those patients for ethical reasons.

PARAGRAPH

Therefore, is there a proper effect of pravastatin itself?

This will be analyzed in the PRODIGE 21 trial in Child-Pugh B patients with HCC, comparing the sorafenib-pravastatin combination to sorafenib alone, pravastatin alone and best supportive care.

This study is closed for inclusion and analysis is ongoing.

PARAGRAPH

An alternative hypothesis is that some patients could derive an advantage from pravastatin.

Our study showed that classical prognostic factors predicted survival (CLIP score, WHO-PS, and QoL scales).

Perhaps another statin would have been better?

We chose pravastatin because it was the only statin investigated in clinical trials on HCC.

PARAGRAPH

Perhaps the clinical anticancer effect of statins would be more evident in other situations; for example, in the adjuvant setting or the early stages of HCC carcinogenesis, as suggested by several retrospective studies after liver resection21 or liver transplantation22 for HCC with lower recurrence risk.

PARAGRAPH

The preclinical studies have demonstrated molecular mechanisms by which statins promote anticancer effects.

Many retrospective studies have suggested their potential benefits.

Even if our study has clearly demonstrated no OS improvement with pravastatin in combination with sorafenib in advanced Child-Pugh A HCC, further prospective randomized studies are necessary to explore the potential oncologic interest of statins in clinical practice.
