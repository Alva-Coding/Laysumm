ABSTRACT

TITLE

Hepatic arterial infusion of oxaliplatin plus fluorouracil/leucovorin vs. sorafenib for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma

PARAGRAPH

To compare the overall survival (OS) and disease progression free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (Ad-HCC) who are undergoing hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil/leucovorin (FOLFOX) treatment vs. sorafenib.

PARAGRAPH

This retrospective study was approved by the ethical review committee, and informed consent was obtained from all patients before treatment.

HAI of FOLFOX (HAIF) was recommended as an alternative treatment option for patients who refused sorafenib.

Of the 412 patients with Ad-HCC (376 men and 36 women) between Jan 2012 to Dec 2015, 232 patients were treated with sorafenib; 180 patients were given HAIF therapy.

The median age was 51 years (range, 16â€“82 years).

Propensity-score matched estimates were used to reduce bias when evaluating survival.

Survival curves were calculated by performing the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by using the log-rank test and Cox regression models.

PARAGRAPH

The median PFS and OS in the HAIF group were significantly longer than those in the sorafenib group (PFS 7.1 vs. 3.3 months [RECIST]/7.4 vs. 3.6 months [mRECIST], respectively; OS 14.5 vs. 7.0 months; p <0.001 for each).

In the propensity-score matched cohorts (147 pairs), both PFS and OS in the HAIF group were longer than those in the sorafenib group (p <0.001).

At multivariate analysis, HAIF treatment was an independent factor for PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.389 [RECIST]/0.402 [mRECIST]; p <0.001 for each) and OS (HR 0.129; p <0.001).

PARAGRAPH

HAIF therapy may improve survival compared to sorafenib in patients with Ad-HCC.

A prospective randomized trial is ongoing to confirm this finding.
