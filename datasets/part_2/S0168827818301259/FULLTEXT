TITLE

Hepatic arterial infusion of oxaliplatin plus fluorouracil/leucovorin vs. sorafenib for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer worldwide.1

A total of 25%–70% of HCC is diagnosed at an advanced stage, with a median overall survival (OS) of only 4.2–7.9 months, because of limited treatment options.2,3

To date, sorafenib is still the only treatment shown to extend OS for advanced HCC (Ad-HCC).4

However limitations including, low response rates,2 modest survival advantages,3 high-level heterogeneity of individual response5 and insensitivity for populations with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection,6 prohibit sorafenib’s widespread use in Ad-HCC.

Thus, alternative therapies for Ad-HCC are urgently required.1,7,8

PARAGRAPH

Recently, several studies have explored hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) chemotherapy (HAIC) alone or accompanied with sorafenib in Ad-HCC and reported favorable results either in response rate or survival.9–11

This therapy can directly deliver chemotherapeutic agents into tumor-associated hepatic arterial branches at increased local concentrations,12 providing stronger antitumor efficacy and lower systemic toxicity through a greater first-pass effect in the liver compared with systemic chemotherapy.13

However, although effective, the response rate of HAIC is unstable and varies from 7 to 81% with median OS of 6–15.9 months.9,14

This may be attributed to complicated combinations of various drugs, including cisplatin, fluorouracil, interferon and doxorubicin.9,14

PARAGRAPH

So far, there are no standard and widely recognized regimens with higher efficacy and well-tolerated toxicity in HAIC for Ad-HCC.

FOLFOX (oxaliplatin plus fluorouracil and leucovorin) was a regimen first used in colorectal cancer with liver metastases and reported to be effective both by systemic and HAIC in clinical trials.15,16

A recent phase III trial, the so called EACH study, evaluated treatment with systemic FOLFOX regimen for Ad-HCC showed that it provided better outcomes than doxorubicin.

Though there lacks high-level evidence for the benefits of doxorubicin in patients with HCC.17

In addition, our phase II study has demonstrated that HAI of FOLFOX (HAIF) was well tolerated and effective in Ad-HCC.18

Herein, we aim to compare the survival benefits between patients with Ad-HCC undergoing HAIF treatment and those who received sorafenib monotherapy.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Patients

PARAGRAPH

Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethical Review Committee of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center for this retrospective study, and informed consent was obtained from all patients before conducting the treatment.

The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

This study involved 412 patients with Ad-HCC staged by Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system4 (376 men [median age, 51 years; range, 16–82 years] and 36 women [mean age, 50 years; range, 27–77 years]) between Jan 2012 to Dec 2015.

The median age was 51 years (range, 16–82 years).

HCC diagnosis was reconfirmed in all patients based on the criteria of American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases practice guidelines.4

Details of quantification of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis, classification of cirrhosis clinical course and hepatic arterial anatomic variants are shown in the supplementary information.

Once HCC at BCLC-C stage was confirmed, the patient was informed that sorafenib was the recommended treatment.

For those who refused to receive sorafenib, HAIF was recommended as an alternative based on previous phase I and phase II studies.19,20

The most common reason for the rejection is the high cost that patients cannot afford because sorafenib is not on the list of drugs covered by medical insurance in China.

Each patient was informed of the advantages and disadvantages of treatments with respect to outcomes, safety, and costs.

The final decision was principally made by the patient.

However, in some cases, the doctor in charge decided which treatment was suitable when the patient was uncertain.

PARAGRAPH

The inclusion criteria consisted of an adequate blood/bone marrow (leukopenia count >3.0 × 109/L, hemoglobin >8.0 g/L, and platelet count >60 × 109/L), liver (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] <5 times the upper limit of the normal range, albumin >2.8 g/L, total bilirubin <2.8 g/L), renal (serum creatinine <1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range) and coagulation (prothrombin time <6 s) function, and a controlled arterial hypertension.

Exclusion criteria consisted of: Child-Pugh score of C, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-performance status (ECOG-PS) >2, at least one incomplete cycle of HAIF or four weeks of sorafenib, without intrahepatic measurable lesions, lack of the first image screen, a secondary malignancy, treated with oxaliplatin or fluorouracil chemotherapy before, and lost to follow-up.

SECTION

Sorafenib cohort

PARAGRAPH

Treatment schedule.

– All patients initially received the standard 400 mg dose of sorafenib twice daily.

Sorafenib delay or temporarily interruption, or dose reduction (400 mg once daily) was permitted for drug-related clinical toxicity (grade 3 or higher based on the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0).

If further dose reductions were required, patients were withdrawn from the study.

SECTION

HAIF cohort

PARAGRAPH

Treatment schedule.

– For the HAIF procedure, a micro-catheter was inserted and located in the feeding hepatic artery.

Specific details are shown in the supplementary information.

Medication was started within two days after catheter insertion.

The therapeutic scheme was a modified FOLFOX6 regimen, including oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 infusion for three hours on day 1), leucovorin (200 mg/m2 from hour three to five hours on day 1) and Fluorouracil (400 mg/m2 in bolus, and then 2,400 mg/m2 continuous infusion 46 hours) (Fig. S2).

All chemo-drugs were given by HAI.

Specific guidelines for dose modification and infusion-related reaction (IRR) of HAIC are provided in the supplementary information.

Treatment was repeated every three weeks and continued until intrahepatic lesions progressed or toxicity became unacceptable.

SECTION

Follow-up and assessments

PARAGRAPH

Treatment discontinuation criteria included: symptomatic or radiological progression; unacceptable toxicities; disease stage downstaging to BCLC-A or B providing an opportunity for an operation, ablation, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or liver transplantation; death, or the patient’s refusal to continue.

To evaluate the safety and compliance of treatment, all patients were followed up with routine examination, which was obtained within one week before commencement of treatment, and then performed every three weeks ± one week and at the end of treatment.

Tumor response was performed with dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography (CT) scan of the upper abdomen, along with CT of chest and/or bone scanning if applicable, every six weeks ± one week during treatment.

The primary endpoint was (OS), which was the length of time after treatment until death from any cause.

Secondary endpoints included progression free survival (PFS) and intrahepatic tumor PFS (ITPFS), tumor response rates, and safety.

The PFS was defined as the time from commencement of treatment to radiological disease progression or death.

ITPFS was defined as the time interval from first procedure to documented radiologically intrahepatic tumor progression or death.

Post radiological progression survival (PRPS) was calculated from the date of detecting progression on image screen by both Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and modified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria until the date of death.

According to the previous studies, radiological progression patterns were classified into four groups, as follows: intrahepatic growth (IHG) or extrahepatic growth (EHG) (≥20% increase in tumor size against a known baseline lesion), a new intrahepatic lesion (NIH), or onset of an extrahepatic lesion and/or vascular invasion (NEH).21–23

Tumor response rates included objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR).

ORR was defined as the percentage of patients who had complete response plus partial response that was maintained for at least four weeks from the first radiological confirmation of that rate, and DCR as ORR plus stable disease.

All responses had to be evaluated using the same imaging method of baseline per both RECIST version 1.1 criteria24 and mRECIST criteria25 by blinded radiologic review.

Two radiologists, without the use of both treatment information and survival data (L.Z. and Z.F.Z., with more than 25 and 20 years of experience, separately), independently assessed the radiological response to minimize the possibility of measurement error.

If there was disagreement, the case would be discussed until agreement was reached.

Patients were followed up until Dec 31, 2016.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Comparisons of baseline and matched characteristics were performed using standard tests for continuous data (Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, respectively) and categorical data (χ2 or Fisher’s exact test and McNemar test, respectively).

To address the selection bias of potential confounders between the HAIF and sorafenib groups, we used a propensity-score matching method to adjust treatment groups.

The propensity-score was generated from a binary logistic regression to estimate the predicted probability of a patient being in the HAIF group, considering pretreatment independent variables that were prognostic for OS.

The propensity-score model included age, sex, etiology, Fibrosis-4 score, liver function, ECOG-PS score, BCLC stage, intrahepatic tumor size, portal vein invasion, extrahepatic spread (EHS), alpha-fetoprotein level, and previous therapy.

Matched pairs between patients managed by HAIF and those who had sorafenib were then formed using a one-to-one nearest-neighbor caliper of width 0.1.

Only patients matched with the propensity-score were included in the time-to-event analysis.

PARAGRAPH

Survival curves were generated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and prognostic variables were compared using the log-rank test.

Cox regression models were used to assess between-group differences in time-dependent outcomes.

Statistically significant variables in the univariate analyses were analyzed in multivariate Cox regression models to evaluate the association between time-dependent outcomes and treatment groups.

To take account of the observational study design, a conservative p value less than 0.01 was considered to indicate significant difference in the comparative analyses between groups; a p value less than 0.05 was considered to suggest significant difference in the logistic regression models informing the propensity-score matched model and in determination of prognostic predictors for the development of survival.

All data in this study have been recorded at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (number RDDA2017000398).

All analyses were performed using SPSS v20 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago IL).

Results

PARAGRAPH

Between Jan 2012 and Dec 2014, sorafenib treatments were carried out and continued for at least four weeks in a total of 294 consecutive patients at our center.

Patients with only lymph nodal or distant metastases without intrahepatic measurable lesions (n = 21), those who were lost to follow-up (n = 25), those with secondary primary malignancies (n = 9), and those with a history of use of systemic or arterial chemotherapy that included oxaliplatin or fluorouracil (n = 7) were excluded from the study.

Between Jan 2013 and Dec 2015, a total of consecutive 209 patients treated with HAIF were reviewed.

Among them, five ultimately declined participation, two dropped out before the end of the first cycle of HAIC because of serious vomiting, five failed to complete the first assessed screen, 14 lost to follow-up, two were treated with systemic FOLFOX chemotherapy before, and one had a secondary cancer; therefore, a total of 180 patients with Ad-HCC and without receiving sorafenib, were included in the efficacy and safety analysis (Fig. 1).

PARAGRAPH

The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample are shown (Table 1).

Of the 412 patients, 405 (98.3%) were diagnosed with BCLC stage C HCC, 342 (83.0%) were infected with HBV, 196 (47.6%) had degree 4 fibrosis and 95 (23.1%) had degree 3 fibrosis.

Antiviral treatment was given in 91.4% (170/186) of patients with HBV in the sorafenib group and in 92.9% (145/156) of patients with HBV in the HAIF group (p = 0.596).

TACE was the most common previous treatment in both groups before enrollment in the study, followed by tumor ablation.

After performing propensity-score matching, we derived one-to-one paired cohorts (147 patients in each group) for HAIF vs. sorafenib (Table 2).

In the matched cohort, there was no longer any significant difference between groups with respect to any key confounders at baseline.

A summary of hepatic arterial anatomic variants and collateral arteries from patients in the HAIF group is shown (Table S3).

SECTION

Radiologic response rate

PARAGRAPH

Based on independent radiologic assessment, the ORR was 29.4% (RECIST)/47.8% (mRECIST) in the HAIF group and 3% (RECIST)/9.1% (mRECIST) in the sorafenib group (p <0.001).

The DCR was also significantly better in the HAIF group than in the sorafenib group (78.9% vs. 47.4% [RECIST]/79.4% vs. 51.7% [mRECIST], respectively; p <0.001).

In the matched cohorts, patients in the HAIF group achieved higher ORR 29.9% (RECIST)/49.7% (mRECIST) and DCR 79.6% (RECIST)/79.6% (mRECIST) than those in the sorafenib group (ORR 2% [RECIST]/9.5% [mRECIST]; p <0.001; DCR 46.3% [RECIST]/50.3% [mRECIST]; p <0.001; Table 3).

SECTION

PFS and ITPFS analyses

PARAGRAPH

The median follow-up time was 14.5 months (range, 4.9 to 44.6 months) in the HAIF group and 6.9 months (range, 1.1 to 13.8 months) in the sorafenib group (p <0.001).

During the follow-up period, radiological disease progression occurred in all patients in the pooled sets.

The median PFS was longer in the HAIF group than in the sorafenib group (7.1 vs. 3.3 months [RECIST]/7.4 vs. 3.6 months [mRECIST], respectively; p <0.001, Fig. 2A,C and Table 3).

There was also a significant difference in median ITPFS between the HAIF group and the sorafenib group (8.1 and 3.8 months [RECIST]/8.5 vs. 4.4 months [mRECIST], respectively; p <0.001, Fig. S3A,C and Table 4).

After propensity-score matched, both median PFS and ITPFS differed significantly between the HAIF group and the sorafenib group (7.1 and 3.3 months [RECIST]/7.4 vs. 4.4 months [mRECIST] of PFS, respectively; p <0.001, Fig. 2B,D; 8.1 and 3.6 months [RECIST]/8.5 vs. 4.8 months [mRECIST] of ITPFS, respectively; p <0.001, Fig. S3B,D; Table 3).

A multivariate analysis using the Cox model identified that HAIF treatment is the only independent prognostic factor for PFS (mRECIST) and ITPFS (RECIST/mRECIST) in the matched cohorts (PFS: hazard ratio [HR] 0.402; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.311–0.521 [mRECIST]; p <0.001; ITPFS: HR 0.298; 95% CI 0.227–0.392 [RECIST]/HR 0.332; 95% CI 0.252–0.436 [mRECIST]; p <0.001, respectively).

Predictors related to PFS (RECIST) were EHS and HAIF treatment (HR 1.271; 95% CI 1.009–1.602; p = 0.042; HR 0.389; 95% CI 0.301–0.502; p <0.001, respectively; Table S4).

SECTION

OS analyses

PARAGRAPH

During the follow-up period, 387 (93.9%) of the 412 patients died (155 patients [86.1%] in the HAIF group and all patients [100%] in the sorafenib group).

The median OS was significantly longer in the HAIF group than in the sorafenib group (14.5 and 7.0 months, respectively; p <0.001, Fig. 3A and Table 4).

Causes of death in both groups were HCC progression (Sorafenib, n = 120; HAIF, n = 85), liver failure (Sorafenib, n = 59; HAIF, n = 38), gastrointestinal bleeding (Sorafenib, n = 22; HAIF, n = 17), various causes (Sorafenib, n = 13; HAIF, n = 2), and unknown causes (Sorafenib, n = 18; HAIF, n = 13).

In the matched cohorts, median OS also differed significantly between groups (14.5 and 7.0 months, respectively; p <0.001, Fig. 3B and Table 4).

The Cox regression results showed HAIF treatment is the only independent prognostic indicator for OS in the matched cohorts (HR 0.129; 95% CI 0.092–0.181; p <0.001; Table S5).

SECTION

PRPS analysis

PARAGRAPH

In both cohorts, 72/232 patients in the sorafenib group and 46/180 patients in the HAIF group were excluded from the analysis of PRPS, because the disease had not progressed on image screen when the patients died.

Median PRPS was 3.9 months in the 160 remaining patients in the sorafenib group and 9.4 months in the 134 remaining patients in the HAIF group (p <0.001).

The median PRPS in patients with radiologic tumor progression according to pattern of radiological progression was as follows: IHG, 4.2 (Sorafenib, n = 74) vs. 8 (HAIF, n = 44) months; EHG, 4 (Sorafenib, n = 37) vs. 9.1 (HAIF, n = 26) months; NIH, 3.5 (Sorafenib, n = 26) vs. 9.8 (HAIF, n = 28) months; NEH, 2.4 (Sorafenib, n = 23) vs. 10 (HAIF, n = 36) months, respectively, (p <0.001 for all).

PARAGRAPH

An additional treatment upon progression was given in 95/232 patients (Sorafenib) and in 94/180 patients (HAIF).

The most popular additional treatment was TACE in both groups (Sorafenib, n = 53; HAIF, n = 39) followed by chemotherapy (Sorafenib, n = 26; HAIF, n = 25), Chinese traditional medical treatment (Sorafenib, n = 10; HAIF, n = 13), radiotherapy (Sorafenib, n = 2; HAIF, n = 8), ablation (Sorafenib, n = 2; HAIF, n = 4), immunotherapy (Sorafenib, n = 2; HAIF, n = 4), and resection (Sorafenib, n = 0; HAIF, n = 1).

Survival at the time of receiving an additional treatment upon progression was 5.2 months (Sorafenib) and 10.2 months (HAIF) (p <0.001).

The median OS of patients who were given an additional treatment upon progression was nine months (Sorafenib) and 19.7 months (HAIF), respectively (p <0.001).

Among patients receiving only sorafenib or HAIF treatment, the median OS was also significantly different between the two groups (5.7 vs. 11.1 months, respectively; p <0.001).

SECTION

Adverse reactions

PARAGRAPH

In the HAIF group, a median of four HAIC cycles (range, 1–8) was performed during the study.

IRR was observed in 10 of all 180 patients (5.6%) in the HAIF group, including six (3.3%) with mild to moderate vomiting, two (1.1%) with mild abdominal pain, and two (1.1%) with serious vomiting.

Dose reduction was performed in five (2.8%) patients because of grade 4 leukopenia.

No patient gave up HAIF treatment for severe liver function deterioration or drug-related toxicity.

Reasons for HAIF treatment discontinuation were HCC progression in 106 (58.9%) patients, disease downstaging to a lower stage providing an opportunity to receive loco-regional treatment in 47 (26.1%), performance status deterioration in 18 (10%), and patient’s decision in 9 (5%).

In the sorafenib group, dose reduction or interruption was required in 96 of 232 patients (41.4%) because of adverse events (AEs).

Reasons for permanent discontinuation of sorafenib were HCC progression in 118 (50.9%) patients, unacceptable AEs in 57 (24.6%), performance status deterioration in 24 (10.3%), liver decompensation in 23 (9.9%), and patient’s decision in 10 (4.3%).

Among the 57 patients who discontinued sorafenib because of unacceptable AEs, the major reasons were hand-foot skin reaction (12.5%, 29 in 232 patients) and diarrhea (9.1%, 21 in 232 patients).

PARAGRAPH

The overall incidence of AEs was 95% in the sorafenib group.

The most frequent serious AEs (grades 3–4) were hand-foot skin reaction (12.9%), diarrhea (12.5%), leukopenia (12.5%), and neutropenia (12.1%).

In the HAIF group, 160 (89%) of the 180 patients experienced AEs, with lower incidence of grade 3 to 4 AEs (9%) than that of grade 1 to 2 (88%).

The main AEs in the HAIF group were fatigue (69%), elevated AST (57%), abdominal pain (44%), elevated ALT (30%), hypoalbuminemia (32%), and weight loss (28%).

Leukopenia was the most common severe toxicity (8%).

(Table 5) HAI procedure-related complications occurred in 15 (8.3%) patients, and all of the complications were mild (Table S6).

No treatment-related deaths were observed within four weeks from the beginning of treatment in either group.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this observational cohort study, we obtained primary evidence on the superiority of HAIF therapy over sorafenib in terms of tumor response, PFS, ITPFS, and OS in the treatment of Ad-HCC, with acceptable and mild risk of AEs caused by both HAIF procedure and related chemotherapeutics.

The credibility of these findings was substantiated by a propensity-score matched analysis that mimics randomization of a prospective study and reduces the bias caused by confounding variables.26

PARAGRAPH

In this study, it was observed that both the ORR and DCR in the HAIF group were significantly higher than that in the sorafenib group (p <0.001).

The median OS in the HAIF group reached 14.5 months compared to only 6.9 months in the sorafenib group, a significant difference (p <0.001).

A previous trial on sorafenib in the Asian-Pacific region also reported a consistent result with OS of 6.5 months.2

The favorable results of FOLFOX by HAIC compared with sorafenib may be associated with the particular epidemiology of the Chinese population.

Our data showed that HBV infection was the most common etiology, accounting for 83.0% of all cases.

Studies on sorafenib in Asian populations, including a phase II study in a HBV-endemic Asian population evaluating single-agent sorafenib in patients with extrahepatic disease,27 the Asian-Pacific SHARP study2 and a meta-analysis of three phase III trials that included sorafenib,6 have suggested a persistent trend that patients with HBV infection benefit less from sorafenib than those without HBV infection.

Genetic heterogeneity of HCC cells from different etiologies is one of the most important reasons for primary resistance to sorafenib, potentially explaining its impaired efficacy in Asian patients.5,28,29

PARAGRAPH

Previous studies have revealed that severe intrahepatic tumor burden and decompensated liver function, but not presence of EHS, are the independent prognostic factors for HCC.30

They lead to intrahepatic tumor progression, associated complications (e.g. upper gastrointestinal bleeding), and liver functional failure, which were the main causes of HCC-related death.31,32

Given multiple failures of systemic agents in the past, therapies focusing on intrahepatic tumors, may provide improvement in the prognosis of Ad-HCC.33,34

Potential benefits of HAIC for Ad-HCC were reported in several well designed randomized trials, before and even after sorafenib was recommended for Ad-HCC universally.9,35–37

Our analysis showed that survival in the HAIF group was better than that in sorafenib group.

A recent phase II study for Ad-HCC showed better OS in patients treated with HAIC combined with sorafenib than in patients treated with sorafenib monotherapy.10

Evidence from subgroup analysis of the SHARP study indicates that sorafenib, though a systemic therapy, cannot yield a marked survival advantage in patients with EHS.30

This may be the other underlying reason explaining the superiority of HAIF therapy over sorafenib, besides population characteristics and HBV infection.

However, head-to-head trials for sorafenib and HAIF that focus on intrahepatic and extrahepatic lesions, respectively, are needed.

PARAGRAPH

Local HAIC has gradually been applied to treat Ad-HCC in Asian countries and is now recommended as one of the first-line treatments by the Japan Society of Hepatology guideline.38

The most common HAIC therapy was based on cisplatin and fluorouracil, the inevitable toxicities of cisplatin forced researchers to reduce the dose for safety.

However, low-dose cisplatin HAIC provides lower efficacy than high-dose HAIC, and produces more discomfort because of the higher frequency of medication required.39

FOLFOX containing oxaliplatin instead of cisplatin is a classic anti-cancer combination and was demonstrated to be effective systemically for Ad-HCC.17

HAI of FOLFOX was previously reported to be effective and safe in liver metastases from colorectal cancer, advanced perihilar cholangiocarcinoma and Ad-HCC.18,40–42

A low incidence of AEs with HAIF was an obvious advantage, especially compared with systemic chemotherapy.

The incidence of grade 3–4 AEs (9%) was similar to previous HAIC studies, and obviously lower than that (55.7%) in the EACH study.17

These results add to the evidence justifying HAIC as an effective and safe therapeutic approach for Ad-HCC.

PARAGRAPH

Some researchers proposed that the progression pattern was an independent predictor of OS in Ad-HCC, and that according to the pattern PRPS played a key role in second-line trial design and analysis.21

The patterns of progression are classified into IHG, EHG, NIH and NEH, according to a series of studies.21–23

We calculated the median PRPS of each pattern of progression in the two groups and found significant difference between two groups in each and all patterns (p <0.001), that was consistent with the survivals.

Considering that once progressed, other additional therapies would be used to control the disease, that may affect the OS to some extent and make it difficult to judge the effect of HAIC or sorafenib accurately.43

Therefore, our results both provided the OS and PRPS, to minimize the interference of additional therapies.

PARAGRAPH

Our study has certain limitations.

Firstly, 29 and 62 patients were excluded from 209 and 294 patients in the HAIF and the sorafenib group, respectively, though necessary, it may lead to selection bias.

Secondly, patients with HBV infection accounted for 83.0% of all cases in this study and additional evidence of survival benefits of HAIF to sorafenib in non-HBV related Ad-HCC is needed, to further justify this finding.

Thirdly, this was a retrospective study, though propensity-score matching was used, the reduced sample size after matching may affect the results.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, the results of this study indicated that HAIF therapy may improve survival in patients with Ad-HCC.

A prospective randomized trial is ongoing to validate these results.
