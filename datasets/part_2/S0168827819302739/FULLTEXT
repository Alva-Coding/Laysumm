TITLE

Activated hepatic stellate cells and portal fibroblasts contribute to cholestatic liver fibrosis in MDR2 knockout mice

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Chronic liver injury often results in liver fibrosis.

The development of liver fibrosis is associated with migration and proliferation of collagen type I-producing myofibroblasts, which are not present in the normal liver.

Activated myofibroblasts originate from 3 major sources: hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), portal fibroblasts (PFs), and fibrocytes.1−4

Activated HSCs (aHSCs) were implicated in the pathogenesis of experimental toxic liver fibrosis, such as chronic CCl4 administration and alcoholic liver disease,1,5 while PFs are predominantly activated in response to cholestatic liver fibrosis, such as bile duct ligation (BDL).2

PARAGRAPH

Several experimental models of cholestatic liver injury have been developed.6

BDL causes rapid activation of PFs, especially at the onset of injury.

Although the pathology resulting from BDL resembles that seen in human chronic cholestatic disease, the surgical stress and the severity of cholestatic injury limit the utility of the BDL model.

The multidrug resistance gene 2 knockout (Mdr2−/−, also known as Abcb4−/−) mouse is another well-established model of chronic cholestatic liver injury.

Deficiency of Mdr2, a canalicular phospholipid flippase, disrupts biliary phospholipid secretion, leading to the increase of potentially toxic bile acid, which induces hepatocyte damage and cholangiopathy,7−9 which is characterized by pericholangitis and onion-skin-type periductal fibrosis, resembling the pathological features of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).10,11

Despite extensive studies,12,13 the contribution of aHSCs and activated PFs (aPFs) to cholestatic fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice has not been defined.

PARAGRAPH

Under physiological conditions, quiescent HSCs (qHSCs) reside in the space of Disse (which is located between hepatocytes and sinusoidal endothelial cells),1 store vitamin A, and serve as liver pericytes.

QHSCs express specific markers, such as glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP), synaptophysin, nerve growth factor p75 (NGFR1), and lecithin retinol acyltransferase (Lrat).2,14,15

In response to toxic liver injury, HSCs downregulate the expression of vitamin A in lipid droplets, migrate to the pericentral areas, and transdifferentiate into collagen type I and α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) expressing myofibroblasts.

PARAGRAPH

Portal fibroblasts, which reside around the portal area and maintain the integrity of the biliary tree and portal tract,16 comprise a small population of fibroblasts in the liver under physiological conditions.

In response to cholestatic injury, PFs proliferate, get activated, and contribute to collagen type I deposition.

APFs can be distinguished from aHSCs by expression of Thy1, Fibulin2, Elastin, Gremlin1, ecto-ATPase nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 2, mesothelin (Msln), and mucin 16 (Muc16),2,14,16,17 and the lack of HSC markers.

PARAGRAPH

Therapeutic approach to cholestatic fibrosis remains challenging; hence, liver transplantation is the only effective therapy for patients with late-stage PSC.18

The activity of NADPH oxidase (NOX), an enzyme system that catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen to superoxide, plays an important role in the activation of HSCs and the development of hepatic fibrosis,19−22 and treatment with a NOX1/4 dual inhibitor decreases both CCl4-induced hepatotoxic fibrosis and BDL-induced cholestatic fibrosis.23

PARAGRAPH

Here, we characterize the development of cholestatic fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice.

We determined that aPFs and aHSCs (but not fibrocytes) contribute to hepatic myofibroblasts in Mdr2−/− mice during the progression of cholestatic fibrosis.

Increased expression of fibrogenic genes was associated with the upregulation of Thy1 and CD34 in aPFs.

Although aPFs were in close proximity to proliferating cholangiocytes, cholangiocytes themselves did not express collagen type I. Hepatic expression of NOX was induced in Mdr2−/− mice only upon the development of liver fibrosis.

Therapeutic inhibition of NOX1/4 in Mdr2−/− mice reversed cholestatic fibrosis, suggesting that targeting NOXs may be an effective strategy for the treatment of cholestatic fibrosis.

SECTION

Results

SECTION

Development of fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice is associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, and ductular reaction

PARAGRAPH

Progression of cholestatic liver fibrosis was analyzed in 4-, 8-, 12-, and 16-week-old Mdr2−/− mice.

Extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition was observed in livers of Mdr2−/− mice as early as 4 weeks of age, and reached maximum at 12–16 weeks, as demonstrated by Sirius Red staining (Fig. 1A and B), which was accompanied by expression of fibrogenic genes (Col1a1, αSMA, Desmin, TIMP1, and TGFβR1 mRNA; Fig. 1C) and inflammatory genes (F4/80, IL-1β, and IL-6 mRNA; Fig. 1D).

Age-dependent ECM deposition in Mdr2−/− mice correlated with increased upregulation of aHSC markers (Desmin, α-SMA, and TIMP1 mRNA), and aPF markers (Thy1, Msln, Muc16, CD34, and Fibulin2 mRNA, with the exception of elastin, in which the expression peaked at 4 weeks of age; Fig. 1E).

Expression of NOX genes (NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 mRNA; Fig. 1F) and cholangiocyte markers (CK19 and Sox9 mRNA; Fig. 1G) followed a similar trend, suggesting that the activation of hepatic myofibroblasts in Mdr2−/− mice positively correlates with the age-dependent development of oxidative stress, hepatic inflammation, and ductular proliferation.

SECTION

Collagen type I-expressing myofibroblasts emerge in the livers of Mdr2−/− mice

PARAGRAPH

To visualize activated myofibroblasts, Mdr2−/− mice were crossed with collagen1-α(I)-GFP reporter mice (in which all Collagen Type I expressing cells are labeled in real time with GFP)25 to generate Mdr2−/−ColGFP mice.

Myofibroblasts first emerged in the livers of 4-week-old Mdr2−/−ColGFP mice (and contributed to 5.2% of the total liver area), and were increased depending on the progression of fibrosis (up to 10.3% area of the total liver area at 8 weeks old, and 11.6% at 16 weeks old; Fig. 1H and I).

Next, the composition of hepatic myofibroblasts was analyzed in Mdr2−/−ColGFP mice.

SECTION

Thy1−GFP+ and Thy1+GFP+ myofibroblasts comprise the major populations of fibrogenic myofibroblasts in the livers of Mdr2−/−ColGFP mice

PARAGRAPH

Livers from 4-, 8-, and 16-week-old Mdr2−/−ColGFP mice were immunostained for the aPF marker, Thy1.

Compared to the total GFP+ myofibroblast area (considered as 100%), Thy1+ aPFs were progressively activated (ranging from 26% to 54% in the livers of 4- and 16-week-old Mdr2−/− mice; Fig. 1I and J).

In turn, the number of Thy1−GFP+ cells increased with age in Mdr2−/− mice, but their relative contribution to myofibroblasts declined (from 73% to 45% of the total GFP+ myofibroblasts in the livers of 4- and 16-week-old Mdr2−/− mice, respectively), suggesting that aHSCs and aPFs are the major contributors to ECM-producing myofibroblasts in Mdr2−/− mice.

PARAGRAPH

Similar results were obtained using flow cytometry for vitamin A (Vit.A) and collagen1-α(I)-GFP myofibroblasts.2

AHSCs were identified by simultaneous expression of Vit.A and ColGFP, while GFP+ aPFs lacked the expression of Vit.A.

Vit.A+GFP+ aHSCs comprised 68% of GFP+ myofibroblasts (100%) in the livers of 4-week-old Mdr2−/− mice, but only 41% in livers of 16-week-old Mdr2−/− mice.

This effect was attributed to the rapid expansion of Vit.A−GFP+ aPFs (Fig. 1K and L), since their contribution to total GFP+ myofibroblasts was increased from 32% in livers of 4-week-old Mdr2−/− mice to 57–59% in livers of 16-week-old Mdr2−/− mice.

We concluded that both aHSCs and aPFs critically contribute to cholestatic fibrosis.

Age-dependent activation of aHSCs and aPFs was further evaluated using histological analysis of Mdr2−/− mice.

SECTION

Thy1+ aPFs serve as a significant source of ECM in Mdr2−/− mice and human cholestatic injury

PARAGRAPH

The pathological features of liver injury were first examined in 4-week-old Mdr2−/− mice.

The onset of cholestatic fibrosis was associated with the accumulation of Thy1+ and Desmin+ cells around the portal area, and displayed typical “onion-skin-like” fibrosis surrounding PanCK+ and Sox9+ cholangiocytes (Fig. 2A).

We also observed proliferation of small Sox9+ bile ducts around Thy1+ aPFs.

Immunostaining of serial sections revealed that the area of ECM deposition overlapped mostly with the Thy1+ area, suggesting that aPFs significantly contribute to the fibrous scar at 4 weeks of age.

PARAGRAPH

At 8 weeks of age, areas positive for Thy1, Desmin, and α-SMA were markedly enlarged and correlated with increased ECM deposition in portal areas of these mice (Fig. 2B).

At this age, expression of PanCK and Sox9 mostly overlapped, and was indicative of maturation of proliferating bile ducts.

A similar, but more severe, pathology was observed in livers of 16-week-old Mdr2−/− mice, and was associated with the formation of a more compact fibrous scar and further activation of Thy1+ and Desmin+ myofibroblasts, whereas the immunoreactivity for αSMA was observed in the portal area, e.g. in fibrotic regions and in basal membranes underlying biliary epithelium (Fig. 2C).

PARAGRAPH

To support our findings in Mdr2−/− mice, we validated the contribution of aPFs to myofibroblasts in human cholestatic disease using immunostaining of human liver sections (Supplementary Fig. S1).

In human livers with cholestatic injury, Thy1+ cells accumulated in the area corresponding to ECM deposition and surrounding the CK19+ cholangiocytes.

Notably, the Thy1+ area mostly overlapped with the Msln+ area, indicating that Thy1+Msln+ aPFs contribute to human cholestatic fibrosis.

SECTION

APFs surround the bile duct and express Desmin and Thy1

PARAGRAPH

Previous reports suggested that injured cholangiocytes can produce Collagen Type I.27 Here, we examined if PanCK+ and/or Sox9+ bile ducts upregulate Collagen Type I in 8-week-old Mdr2−/−ColGFP mice.

Despite close proximity to Thy1+ aPFs, neither PanCK+ nor Sox9+ cholangiocytes expressed collagen1-α(I)-GFP (Fig. 2D and E), indicating that cholangiocytes do not contribute to ECM deposition.

The majority of Thy1+ aPFs accumulated in the portal area, while Desmin+GFP+ aHSCs were mostly located in the hepatic acini or capsular areas (Fig. 2F).

Surprisingly, Desmin positive staining was also observed in the portal areas populated with aPFs (Fig. 2G).

Furthermore, immunoreactivity for Desmin and Thy1 was co-localized in 30–40% of GFP+ portal myofibroblasts, while parenchymal and sinusoidal GFP+ HSCs were stained positive only for Desmin (Fig. 2H).

Similar results were obtained in 4- and 16-week-old Mdr2−/− mice, suggesting that anti-Desmin antibodies might not discriminate between aHSCs and aPFs in livers of Mdr2−/− mice.

PARAGRAPH

To address this question, cholestatic injury was induced in HSC-specific LratYFP mice15 (generated by crossing LratCre and Rosa26YFP mice) via ligation of the common bile duct (BDL; 5 days).

Similarly, LratYFP-labeled cells were stained positive not only for Desmin+Thy1− HSCs, but also for Desmin−Thy1+ aPFs (Supplementary Fig. S2), and exhibited a distribution pattern similar to that observed in Mdr2−/− mice.

Our data imply that LratCre mice are suited for lineage tracing of both aHSCs and aPFs (due to Lrat expression during embryonic development).

We also concluded that a subset of Mdr2-deficient aPFs upregulates Desmin.

Therefore, additional markers that discriminate aPFs from aHSCs are needed.

SECTION

CD34+ aPFs contribute to cholestatic fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice

PARAGRAPH

In an attempt to identify additional markers of aPFs that can be used for immunohistochemical studies, expression of CD34 on aPFs and aHSCs was evaluated.

Transmembrane phosphoglycoprotein CD34, a member of the sialomucin family, is expressed by a variety of cells, including hematopoietic and endothelial cells, as well as mesenchymal progenitors and aPFs.2

Here, we demonstrate that CD34+ was strongly expressed in ColGFP+ aPFs upon the development of cholestatic fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice (Fig. 3A and B; Supplementary Fig. S3A).

Upregulation of CD34 mRNA also positively correlated with an increased expression of other aPF-specific markers (Thy1, Msln, Muc16, Fibulin2; Fig. 1D).

CD34+ cells accumulated predominantly in the portal (57%) and sinusoidal (24%) areas, and were scattered throughout the capsular (17%) area (Fig. 3C; Supplementary Fig. S4A).

CD34+ staining did not overlay with PanCK+ and/or Sox9+ cells (Fig. 3D and E), suggesting that CD34 marks a population of aPFs in the livers of Mdr2−/− mice.

In support, a population of CD34+ aPFs was detected in the livers of BDL-injured (but not CCl4-injured) ColGFP mice (Fig. 3F and G).

Our data are in concordance with previous reports demonstrating that aPFs minimally contribute to CCl4-induced liver fibrosis2 (Supplementary Fig. S4B).

The majority of CD34+ cells co-expressed Thy1 (63%) and Desmin (48%), and exhibited a fibroblast-like spindle shape in the livers of Mdr2−/− mice (Fig. 3H and I; Supplementary Fig. S3A).

Hence, a small fraction of CD34+GFP+ cells (4%) exhibited a fibrocyte-like shape (Fig. 3J), and co-expressed CD45 and F4/80 (Fig. 3K and L), suggesting that these cells might derive from BM fibrocytes.

SECTION

AHSCs exhibit a more fibrogenic phenotype than aPFs

PARAGRAPH

To further dissect the contribution of aHSCs and aPFs to fibrosis, Vit.A+GFP+ aHSCs and Vit.A−GFP+ aPFs (with high [hi] and low expression of GFP, for comparison based on the degree of activation) were sort purified (Fig. 4A) from livers of 16-week-old Mdr2−/− mice, and their gene expression profile was analyzed by RNAseq.

As expected, Vit.A+GFP+ aHSCs expressed typical HSC markers (Lrat, Pdgfrb, Desmin, and GFAP) and lacked expression of aPFs (Msln, Glipican3, Fibulin2, and Uroplakin1B; Fig. 4B).

In turn, Vit.A−GFPhi aPFs expressed markers of aPFs (but lacked Desmin, Lrat, and GFAP).

Slight upregulation of Thy1, Wt1, and CD34 mRNA was observed in aHSCs compared to qHSCs, while these markers were downregulated in Vit.A−GFPlow aPFs compared to Vit.A−GFPhi aPFs.

In addition, expression of Msln, Glipican3, Fibulin2, Uroplakin, Vimentin, Col6a1, Col5a2 mRNA, and other genes was also reduced in Vit.A−GFPlow aPFs (Fig. 4C), suggesting that Vit.A−GFPlow aPFs exhibit a less activated phenotype compared to Vit.A−GFPhi aPFs, consistent with their higher collagen GFP expression.

Despite these differences, the majority of genes were similarly expressed in Vit.A−GFPhi and Vit.A−GFPlow aPFs (Fig. 4D and E), which suggests that these 2 populations originate from the same cell type at different stages of activation.

In support, the expression of CD34 has been linked to maturation of tissue fibroblasts.28

PARAGRAPH

Furthermore, high expression of early growth response 1; intermediate expression of Upk1bm, Fbln2, and Msln; and low expression of CD34 and Thy1 mRNA distinguished Vit.A−GFPlow aPFs from Vit.A−GFPhi aPFs and Vit.A+GFP+ aHSCs (Fig. 4F).

When Reactome pathways were compared, aHSCs and both populations of aPFs expressed genes associated with ECM deposition (see Supplementary Tables S2–4), which is consistent with their myofibroblast phenotypes.

High expression of Col1a1, Col1a2, and other fibrogenic genes was observed mostly in aHSCs.

Unlike BDL-activated aPFs,2 Vit.A−GFPhi aPFs in Mdr2-deficient mice expressed less Col1a1 than aHSCs (Fig. 4H), but almost exclusively upregulated Bmp1, Col27a1, Col11a2, Col4a3, and Tll1 mRNA (Fig. 4G).

Based on the gene expression profile, we concluded that aHSCs serve as a major source of ECM in the livers of 16-week-old Mdr2−/− mice.

SECTION

Minor contribution of BM-derived fibrocytes in Mdr2−/− mice

PARAGRAPH

CD34+ fibrocytes were implicated in the pathogenesis of cholestatic fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice.29

In accord, a small number of ColGFP+ cells co-expressing CD34+, CD45, and F4/80 (2–4%), designated as fibrocytes, were scattered throughout portal, sinusoidal, and capsular areas in the livers of Mdr2−/− mice (Fig. 5A–C; Supplementary Fig. S3B).

To directly assess the contribution of BM-derived fibrocytes to collagen type I-producing cells/myofibroblasts in livers of Mdr2−/− mice, BM from donor ColGFP mice was transplanted into lethally irradiated recipient 4-week-old Mdr2−/− mice.

Recipient Mdr2−/− mice were sacrificed at 16 weeks of age, and livers were analyzed for the presence of GFP+, CD45+, and F4/80+ cells (Fig. 5D).

Although BM-derived ColGFP+ fibrocytes migrated to the livers of recipient Mdr2−/− mice, they retained a fibrocyte-like round shape, and contributed to neither Desmin+ nor CD34+ myofibroblasts (Fig. 5E and F; Supplementary Fig. S5), suggesting that ColGFP+ fibrocytes minimally contribute to fibrogenic myofibroblasts in livers of Mdr2−/− mice.

Meanwhile, the composition of CD45+ cells in the livers of Mdr2−/− mice was further analyzed.

SECTION

CD45+Gr1+ neutrophils migrate into a portal area in the early stage of Mdr2−/− cholestatic injury

PARAGRAPH

Immunostaining with anti-CD45 antibody detected a flux of BM-derived cells into the livers of Mdr2−/− mice as early as 3 weeks of age, which persisted throughout the 16 weeks of age (Fig. 6A and B).

Based on the timeline, we concluded that recruitment of CD45+Gr1+ cells (at 3 weeks of age; Supplementary Fig. S6A) precedes the activation of PFs (4 weeks of age) and the development of fibrogenic responses in Mdr2−/− mice.

Remarkably, at 4 weeks of age, the expression pattern of CD45+ and Gr1+ cells overlapped.

CD45+ and Gr1+ cells were located between ColGFP+ myofibroblasts, and were incorporated into the fibrous scar (Fig. 6C).

CD45+ or Gr1+ cells did not express ColGFP (except a 2–4% population of BM-derived fibrocytes; Fig. 5) or CD3 in livers of 4-week-old Mdr2−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. S6B), suggesting that the majority of CD45+ cells were neutrophils/granulocytes.

Notably, some CD45+ and Gr1+ cells also infiltrated the structures of the bile ducts, and some Gr1+ cells were scattered between cholangiocytes (Fig. 6D and E).

SECTION

Progression of cholestatic fibrosis is associated with upregulation of NOX1 and NOX4 in livers of Mdr2−/− mice

PARAGRAPH

Therapeutic approaches to treat cholestatic fibrosis remain limited.

The activity of NOX, an enzyme system that catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen to superoxide, plays an important role in the activation of HSCs and macrophages, and promotes the development of hepatic fibrosis.19,22

In support, strong induction of NOX genes was associated with the activation of myeloid cells and myofibroblasts, especially in 12- to 16-week-old Mdr2−/− mice (Fig. 1F).

The RNAseq analysis also confirmed the expression of NOX4, Cyba (p22phox), Cybb (NOX2), and Noxo1 in aPFs, and Cyba, Ncf2 (p67phox), Cybb, and Ncf1 (p47phox) in aHSCs (Supplementary Fig. S7).

When livers of 16-week-old Mdr2−/− mice were examined, the expression of 4-HNE (a marker of lipid peroxidation, which reflects oxidative stress) was highly upregulated in hepatocytes (in centrilobular area; Supplementary Fig. S8A), cholangiocytes, Thy1+ cells, CD34+ cells, and CD45+ cells (in the portal area; Supplementary Fig. S8B).

We hypothesized that blocking of the NOX pathway might attenuate or reverse cholestatic fibrosis in 12- to 16-week-old Mdr2−/− mice.

SECTION

Administration of NOX1/4 inhibitor attenuates cholestatic fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice

PARAGRAPH

In an attempt to identify a novel therapeutic strategy to suppress cholestatic injury of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, and prevent the activation of BM-derived neutrophils and fibrogenic myofibroblasts in Mdr2−/− mice, 12-week-old Mdr2−/− mice were treated with a NOX1/4 inhibitor for 4 weeks (GKT137831: 20 or 60 mg/kg, oral gavage, 5×/week, total 20 doses; Fig. 7A).

Livers of Mdr2−/− mice were analyzed at 16 weeks of age.

The administration of NOX1/4 inhibitor improved liver function (≈↓1.5-fold ALT and bilirubin; Fig. 7B and C); effectively downregulated histological markers 4-HNE, Desmin, Thy1, CD34, CD45, PanCK, and Sox9 expression; and reversed pericentral fibrosis (Fig. 7D–H; Supplementary Fig. S9).

This effect was accompanied by reduced (≈↓2-fold) expression of all major fibrogenic markers (Col1a1, α-SMA, PAI1, and TIMP1), aPF-specific markers (Thy1, Msln, Muc16, Fibulin, Elastin, and CD34), and cholangiocyte markers (PanCK and Sox9), as detected by qPCR (Fig. 7I–L).

In a protein assay using Western blot, the administration of the NOX1/4 inhibitor significantly attenuated the αSMA and Thy1 upregulation with reduced activation of Smad2 and Erk1/2 pathway (Fig. 7M).

To further address the specific effect of the NOX inhibitor on aHSCs and aPFs, we additionally performed in vitro studies, in which HSCs and PFs stimulated by TGFβ1 were treated with the NOX1/4 inhibitor.

The administration of the NOX1/4 inhibitor significantly attenuated the expression of pro-fibrogenic markers (Supplementary Fig. S10A) as well as NOX genes (Supplementary Fig. S10B) in both HSCs and PFs.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

This study demonstrates that both aPFs and aHSCs contribute to the pathogenesis of cholestatic fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice.

APFs were mostly localized in the portal areas, while aHSCs were located in the portal, sinusoidal, and capsular areas.

Consistent with a common etiology of cholestatic injury, Thy1+ColGFP+ aPFs in Mdr2−/− mice exhibited a phenotype similar to that observed in aPFs in the BDL model.14

APFs were located in close proximity to proliferating bile ducts, but cholangiocytes themselves did not express collagen type I. Although the activation of PFs was preceded by the recruitment of CD45+ and GR1+ myeloid cells to the portal areas, ColGFP+CD45+ fibrocytes minimally contributed to ECM deposition in livers of Mdr2−/− mice.

We concluded that aPFs and aHSCs are the primary targets for antifibrotic therapy.

Activation of NOXs is a common mediator fibrosis in multiple organs and multiple models, and plays a critical role in the activation of aHSCs.

Here, we demonstrate that NOXs are upregulated not only in aHSCs, but also in aPFs in the livers of Mdr2−/− mice.

Therapeutic blocking of NOX1/4 reversed the myofibroblast activation and liver fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice, suggesting that blocking of NOX1 and NOX4 might provide a novel target for the treatment of cholestatic fibrosis.

PARAGRAPH

Cholestatic injury in Mdr2−/− mice is caused by the damage to hepatocytes (which lack functional canaliculus),6 leading to toxic-bile-related inflammation and damage to biliary epithelium.7

The activation of PFs is accompanied by progressive pericholangitis and cholangiocyte proliferation.

Most PanCK+ and Sox9+ bile ducts were surrounded by Thy1+ aPFs, suggesting that aPFs may play a key role in the maintenance of the structure and integrity of the biliary tree, regulating cholangiocyte proliferation, and maintaining their polarity.17,30,31

Although aHSCs were also detected in the portal areas, most aHSCs were located in the pericentral, sinusoidal, and capsular areas in the livers of Mdr2−/− mice.

In comparison, very few aPFs were scattered throughout the sinusoidal or capsular area, suggesting that specific distribution of different cell types is associated with their distinct roles during the development of cholestatic fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice.16

In support, we identified a unique population of CD45+ and Gr1+ cells populating periductular areas at the very onset of cholestatic injury in Mdr2−/− mice.

Some of these Gr1+ cells directly infiltrated into the bile duct structures, and were located underneath or between cholangiocytes, suggesting that they might play a critical role in the regulation of ductular proliferation and/or activation of PFs.

Mdr2 deficiency has been reported to induce the disruption of the basement membrane of cholangial duct, leading to the leakage of bile acid into the periductal space.7

We can speculate that the CD45+ and Gr1+ neutrophils migrated in response to early injury of cholangiocytes and bile acid leakage, causing acute inflammation and subsequent expansion of periportal myofibroblasts.

PARAGRAPH

Our current study evaluated the dynamic age-dependent changes in histological and mRNA expression of cell-specific markers during the development of cholestatic fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice.

To support our histological findings, widely used reporter collagen-1α(1)-GFP mice were used to visualize collagen type I-expressing myofibroblasts.

In contrast to previous reports,27 here, we demonstrate that PanCK+ or Sox9+ cholangiocytes did not upregulate Collagen Type I in livers of Mdr2−/− mice.

Furthermore, Desmin has been previously considered as an HSC-specific marker.

Based on our analysis, Desmin positive staining was co-localized in approximately 36% of Thy1+ aPFs and Thy1− aHSCs.

As this result could be attributed to a nonspecific immunoreactivity of anti-Desmin Ab, we examined the livers from reporter LratYFP mice, which are used for lineage tracing of HSCs.

We demonstrated that, in mice expressing constitutive LratYFP, 46% of Thy1+ aPFs were marked with LratYFP, and 73% of Desmin+ cells were marked with LratYFP, suggesting that LratCre does not discriminate between aPFs and HSCs.

This fact would explain why Mederacke et al.15 did not identify aPFs as a population distinct from aHSCs that contributes to cholestatic fibrosis in LratYFP mice.

In adult mice, Lrat is expressed in HSCs and not PFs.2,15

Given the mesenchymal origin of both aPFs and aHSCs, the expression of Lrat during embryonic development might result in genetic labeling of both PF and HSC populations in LratYFP mice.

Lrat is also expressed in extrahepatic tissues, including the lung and retina.32

Such common markers as Desmin and Lrat may be expressed in myofibroblasts originating from either HSCs or PFs, suggesting that new markers are needed to discriminate between aPFs and aHSCs.

Thus, the contribution of aPFs in Mdr2−/− mice might have been masked by using the conventional markers for HSCs, including Desmin and LratYFP.

In this study, the marker Thy1, expression of Type I collagen, absence of vitamin A, and the characteristic localization have revealed the significant role of aPFs in cholestatic fibrosis.

PARAGRAPH

Furthermore, we identified that a subset of Thy1+ColGFP+ aPFs co-expressed CD34.

CD34+ cells located in a portal area exhibited a myofibroblast-like shape.

Expansion of CD34+ColGFP+ aPFs was a unique feature of cholestatic liver fibrosis, as demonstrated by the upregulation of CD34+ColGFP+ aPFs in Mdr2−/− and BDL-injured mice, and was not observed in livers of CCl4-injured mice.

Our data suggest that CD34 is another marker of aPFs in adult mice.

In support, expression of CD34 as a marker of hepatic mesenchymal progenitor cells was previously suggested.28

Follow-up studies are needed to determine the functional properties of Thy1+CD34+ and Thy1+CD34− aPFs.

Bone-marrow-derived fibrocytes are another population that can potentially give rise to myofibroblasts.3,33

It has been reported that CD34+ fibrocytes of BM origin are involved in fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice.29

In the present study, only few CD34+ fibrocytes contributed to a population of ColGFP+ myofibroblasts.

PARAGRAPH

The therapeutic properties of NOX1/4 inhibitor on liver fibrosis induced by CCl4, BDL, and NASH models have been previously reported.23,34

This study demonstrated the effectiveness of NOX1/4 inhibition on cholestatic fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice.

Notably, the administration of the NOX1/4 inhibitor reduced oxidative stress, activation/proliferation of aHSCs and Thy1+desmin+CD34+ aPFs, portal infiltration with CD45+ cells, and cholangiocyte proliferation.

Thus, we propose that the interactions between cholangiocyte injury, neutrophil migration, and PF activation are targets of NOX inhibition.
