TITLE

Outcomes of DCD liver transplantation using organs treated by hypothermic oxygenated perfusion before implantation

PARAGRAPH

Machine perfusion techniques are currently being introduced into the clinic, with the aim of optimising injured grafts prior to implantation.

While short-term effects of machine liver perfusion have been frequently reported in terms of hepatocellular enzyme release and early graft function, the long-term benefit on irreversible graft loss has been unclear.

Herein, we report on 5-year graft survival in donation after cardiac death livers, treated either by conventional cold storage, or by 1–2 h of hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) after cold storage.

Graft loss was significantly less in HOPE-treated livers, despite longer donor warm ischaemia times.

Therefore, HOPE after cold storage appears to be a simple and effective method to treat high-risk livers before implantation.
