ABSTRACT

TITLE

Decentralized care with generic direct-acting antivirals in the management of chronic hepatitis C in a public health care setting

PARAGRAPH

The prevalence of anti-hepatitis C virus antibody in Punjab, India is 3.6%, with 728,000 people estimated to have viremic chronic hepatitis C (CHC).

The Mukh-Mantri Punjab Hepatitis C Relief Fund, launched on 18th June 2016, provides no-cost generic direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) with sofosbuvir + ledipasvir ± ribavirin or sofosbuvir + daclatasvir ± ribavirin with the goal of eliminating CHC from Punjab.

We assessed the safety and efficacy of decentralized treatment of CHC in a public health care setting.

PARAGRAPH

Primary care providers from 3 university and 22 district hospitals were trained to provide algorithm-based DAA treatment and supervised by telehealth clinics conducted fortnightly.

The diagnosis of cirrhosis was based on clinical and radiological evidence, including aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI ≥2.0) and FIB-4 score (>3.25), or on liver stiffness measurement ≥12.5 kPa on Fibroscan®.

PARAGRAPH

We enrolled 48,088 individuals with CHC (63.8% male; mean age 42.1 years; 80.5% rural; 14.8% compensated cirrhosis; 69.9% genotype [GT] 3) between 18th June 2016 to 31st July 2018.

While 36,250 (75.4%) patients completed treatment, 5,497 (11.4%) had treatment interruptions and 6,341 (13.2%) patients are currently ongoing treatment.

Sustained virological response at 12 weeks after treatment completion (SVR12) was achieved in 91.6% of patients per protocol, 67.6% in intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, where all interruptions were treated as failures, and 91.2% in a modified ITT analysis where all patients with successful SVR12 in the interruptions arm were included as cured.

SVR12 rates in patients with and without cirrhosis and GT3 versus non-GT3 were comparable.

The SVR12 rate was 84.4% in patients who had treatment interruptions.

PARAGRAPH

Decentralized care of patients with CHC using generic all-oral DAA regimens is safe and effective regardless of genotype or presence of cirrhosis.
