TITLE

Usefulness of biochemical remission and transient elastography in monitoring disease course in autoimmune hepatitis

PARAGRAPH

Autoimmune hepatitis is an inflammatory disease of the liver, which often progresses to cirrhosis if left untreated or in the case of insufficient treatment response.

Current guidelines have defined biochemical remission (normalisation of biochemical markers for liver inflammation) as a major goal in the treatment of AIH.

However, data on the prognostic relevance of this definition are scarce.

Herein, we demonstrate that the current definition of biochemical remission is a reliable surrogate for low disease activity on histological assessment and for a beneficial long-term disease course.

In addition, we establish transient elastography, a non-invasive ultrasound-based method of measuring scarring of liver tissue, as a reliable tool to monitor disease course in AIH.
