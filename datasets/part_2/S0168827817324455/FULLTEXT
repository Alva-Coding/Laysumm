TITLE

Usefulness of biochemical remission and transient elastography in monitoring disease course in autoimmune hepatitis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic disease, which harbours a significant risk of fibrosis progression when treatment is insufficient.1,2

Some patients may progress despite immunosuppressive treatment.3,4

Therefore, AIH patients require close, life-long follow-up.

In daily practice, treatment monitoring is mainly guided by biochemical surrogate markers for hepatic inflammation.

Besides serum aminotransferases, it has been demonstrated that selectively elevated IgG levels also indicate ongoing inflammatory activity in AIH.5

Therefore, complete biochemical remission has been defined as repeatedly normal serum aminotransferase and IgG levels.

Although the prognostic relevance of this definition is uncertain, current treatment guidelines have incorporated this definition as the goal of immunosuppressive treatment in AIH.6–8

Since complete biochemical remission is hard to achieve in some patients and requires high doses of immunosuppressants in others, it is important to validate the prognostic significance of this definition.

PARAGRAPH

Monitoring treatment response and disease progression by biochemical markers may have limitations, since a proportion of patients may display relevant inflammatory activity on liver histology despite normal biochemical markers.4,5

In addition, AIH is characterised by a fluctuating disease course, which may mask repeated flares and disease progression if laboratory values are controlled infrequently.

Therefore, although not generally recommended by current guidelines, many experts perform follow-up liver biopsies to assess inflammatory activity and disease progression.

However, liver biopsies are invasive procedures bearing a residual risk of severe complications and are of limited acceptance among patients.

PARAGRAPH

Therefore, non-invasive surrogate markers of disease progression are urgently needed to better guide immunosuppressive treatment.

We have recently validated liver stiffness (LS) measurement by transient elastography (TE) as a non-invasive tool to assess liver fibrosis in treated AIH.9

TE is currently the only validated non-invasive method to estimate liver fibrosis in AIH with a reliable accuracy and reproducibility.9,10

In the cholestatic autoimmune liver diseases, primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), it could be demonstrated that changes in LS are strongly linked with disease progression and outcome.11–13

However, there are no data assessing progression rates of LS in AIH.

PARAGRAPH

Hence, we aimed i) to validate complete biochemical remission as a surrogate of histological remission and development of liver fibrosis, and ii) to assess the value of repeat TE for monitoring disease progression in AIH.

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Patients

PARAGRAPH

All patients were regularly followed-up at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) between July 2004 and December 2015.

Data on clinical, biochemical and histological features were collected prospectively in a database and analysed retrospectively.

PARAGRAPH

The research protocol was approved by the local ethical committee (PV4081).

SECTION

Diagnostic criteria

PARAGRAPH

Autoimmune Hepatitis.

AIH was diagnosed by clinical, biochemical, serological and histopathological findings consistent with the recent EASL practice guidelines.8

All patients underwent a liver biopsy and were treated at the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf.

Chronic viral hepatitis B and C had been excluded by serological testing in all patients.

SECTION

Primary biliary cholangitis

PARAGRAPH

PBC was diagnosed according to current guidelines on cholestatic liver diseases based on the following criteria: two of the three following conditions were fulfilled): (i) alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level above 1.5 the upper limit of normal (ULN) for at least six months; (ii) presence of serum antimitochondrial antibodies at a minimal titre of 1:40; and (iii) histological evidence of inflammatory destructive cholangitis of interlobular bile ducts on biopsy.14

SECTION

Primary sclerosing cholangitis

PARAGRAPH

The diagnosis of PSC was based on typical radiological findings (multiple strictures of the large intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts on magnetic resonance cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangiography) and/or typical histological findings (periductal fibrosis and/or fibro-obliterative, cholangitis) on liver biopsy.14,15

SECTION

Patients with autoimmune hepatitis and follow-up liver biopsy (AIH cohort I)

PARAGRAPH

All AIH patients with at least two liver biopsies separated by a minimum time-period of one year were considered for inclusion.

Patients with AIH/PBC or AIH/PSC overlap syndrome or a history of liver transplantation were not included.

SECTION

Patients with successive liver stiffness measurements (AIH cohort II)

PARAGRAPH

Patients with at least two subsequent LS measurements separated by a minimum time interval of one year were considered eligible for this study.

PARAGRAPH

Patients with ascites, extrahepatic cholestasis, pregnancy, a history of liver transplantation, cholangiocarcinoma or hepatocellular carcinoma, AIH/PBC or AIH/PSC overlap syndrome were not considered eligible.

PARAGRAPH

We have recently demonstrated for AIH that the degree of liver inflammation affecting the diagnostic accuracy of TE has resolved in most patients after at least six months of immunosuppressive treatment.9

Therefore, TE in patients with AIH performed within the first six months of treatment or in patients presenting with a severe flare were not included.

PARAGRAPH

Fibrosis stage classification at baseline was based on TE, therefore the previously determined cut-off values for PBC,11 PSC13 and AIH9 were applied.

PARAGRAPH

Patients with AIH who had undergone both, follow-up TE and follow-up liver biopsies, were assigned to the liver histology group.

To clarify that two different AIH cohorts have been analysed in this study, the AIH cohort with follow-up liver biopsies will be referred to as “AIH cohort I” while the AIH cohort of patients with follow-up TE will be referred to as “AIH cohort II”.

The flow of all patients with AIH included in this study is displayed (Fig. 1).

SECTION

Stable biochemical remission

PARAGRAPH

Complete biochemical remission was defined according to current EASL guidelines8 as repeatedly normal serum aminotransferases and IgG levels.

To assure stable biochemical remission, aminotransferases and IgG were assessed at least every three to four months.

Patients in biochemical remission had at least three times normal aminotransferases and IgG levels prior to follow-up TE or follow-up biopsy.

SECTION

Transient elastography

PARAGRAPH

Liver stiffness measurement by TE was performed using FibroScan (EchoSens, Paris, France) as reported previously.16

The target area of the right liver lobe was determined by ultrasound to be 6 cm in depth without major vascular structures.

Only procedures with at least 10 valid measurements, an interquartile range (IQR)/median ratio of less than 30% and a success rate of at least 60% were included.

The median value of LS was recorded in kPa.

All TE were performed by two well-experienced and well-trained investigators having performed more than 2,000 measurements each (K.F. and I.S).

SECTION

Mini-laparoscopic guided liver biopsy

PARAGRAPH

In the majority (79%) of patients, liver biopsies were carried out by mini-laparoscopy as described previously.17

Liver biopsies from the right and left lobe were obtained under laparoscopic control using the Tru-cut 16 or 18 GAUGE needle (Bard monopty; Bard biopsy systems, Tempe, USA).

In the rest of the cohort (21%), liver biopsy was performed by Menghini needle biopsy.

SECTION

Liver histology

PARAGRAPH

Only liver specimens of at least 0.8 cm in size were considered eligible.

The median length of liver specimens was 1.8 cm (range 0.8 to 2.9 cm).

The number of portal fields was documented in 75% of patients and was 13 (range 7 to 26) per liver specimen.

Liver specimens from both liver lobes were judged (if available) and the liver specimen with the most severe stage of fibrosis was considered.

PARAGRAPH

Liver biopsy specimens were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and van Gieson-Elastin.

Fibrosis was staged according to Desmet and Scheuer18 on a 0–4 scale: F0 = no fibrosis; F1 = portal fibrosis without septa; F2 = portal fibrosis and few septa; F3 = numerous septa without cirrhosis; F4 = cirrhosis.

Inflammatory activity was graded using the modified hepatitis activity index score (mHAI 0–18).19

PARAGRAPH

No patient experienced clinically relevant biopsy complications.

SECTION

Data analysis

PARAGRAPH

Statistical analyses were performed using IBM® SPSS® Statistics 19.

All continuous variables were expressed as mean or as median and range if not normally distributed.

Differences between continuous variables were calculated using the two-sampled t test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, according to data distribution.

Percentages were compared using the chi-square test or the Fisher’s exact test as appropriate.

The significance level was set at 0.05, and all p values were two-tailed.

PARAGRAPH

The association between TE or histological inflammatory activity and biochemical markers for hepatic inflammation (serum aminotransferase or IgG levels) was estimated by the Spearman’s p coefficient.

PARAGRAPH

Predictors for histological regression of fibrosis were explored by log-binomial regression.

All variables with evidence of an association with development of fibrosis (p <0.10) in univariate analyses were included in a multivariate analysis to adjust for potential confounding factors.

PARAGRAPH

Repeated TE analysis.

Due to time intervals between TE being unequal both between and within patients, a generalised mixed model assuming two random effects (intercept: mean LS at baseline; slope: changes of LS per year as percentages from baseline values) for each fibrosis category (F0–F1, F2, F3, and F4) was applied to assess the progression rate of LS and its 95% CI for each fibrosis stage.

The influence of clinical and biochemical variables was considered as a fixed effect and was assessed by introducing these covariates into the model.

It was assumed that the effect of each covariate was equally weighted among all fibrosis categories.

Results

SECTION

Baseline characteristics of AIH patients with follow-up liver biopsies: AIH cohort I

PARAGRAPH

A total of 60 patients who had undergone 131 liver biopsies were considered eligible.

Median follow-up between liver biopsies was 5.6 years (range: 1.2–20).

PARAGRAPH

Liver biopsies were performed at presentation, prior to treatment withdrawal after reaching remission, to evaluate treatment failure, or to rule out differential diagnoses.

PARAGRAPH

Follow-up time of the total cohort of patients with follow-up biopsies was 10.6 years (range 3.8–24.6), only two patients with poor treatment response developed de novo signs of portal hypertension (varices and diuretic-controlled ascites) during this time.

Both patients showed severe inflammatory activity in follow-up biopsies (mHAI 10 and 11).

No other adverse outcomes were documented.

PARAGRAPH

All patients were under immunosuppression at the time of follow-up biopsy.

At the time of follow-up biopsy, treatment consisted of corticosteroids alone in five (8%) patients, monotherapy with azathioprine in 15 (25%) patients, combination therapy of corticosteroids and azathioprine in 37 (62%) patients, combination therapy of 6-mercaptopurine and corticosteroids in two (3%) patients, and one patient received therapy with infliximab.

SECTION

Complete biochemical remission correlates with histological AIH disease activity in follow-up biopsies

PARAGRAPH

In a first step, we investigated whether complete biochemical remission correlated with histological disease activity in a cohort of 60 patients with AIH and follow-up biopsies (AIH cohort I).

PARAGRAPH

Complete biochemical remission was hereby confirmed as a reliable surrogate marker for histological disease activity in follow-up biopsies: of the 22 (37%) patients in stable biochemical remission at the time of follow-up biopsy, only four (18%) had residual histological activity (mHAI 4 or 5) and none had high inflammatory activity (mHAI ≥6).

In contrast, of the 38 patients who had elevated serum aminotransferases and/or IgG levels, 70% had persisting inflammatory activity (mHAI >3) (48% had an mHAI ≥6).

PARAGRAPH

Interestingly, patients with persisting disease activity (mHAI 4 or 5) despite biochemical remission tended to have higher serum aminotransferase levels, although within the normal range, than those patients with histological activity below mHAI of 4/18 (ALT 21 U/L (range 9–31) vs. 31 U/L (range 27–35), p = 0.09).

PARAGRAPH

Six patients had normal serum aminotransferases, but elevated IgG levels at the time of follow-up biopsy (partial biochemical remission).

Out of these six patients, three had relevant histological activity (mHAI 4, 6 and 8).

Histological disease activity in dependence of ALT and IgG is displayed (Fig. 2).

Taken together, these results confirm the importance of complete biochemical remission, defined as normal serum aminotransferase and IgG levels, as a surrogate of histological activity.

PARAGRAPH

The main characteristics of patients with follow-up biopsies (AIH cohort I) in dependence of biochemical remission are displayed (Table 1).

SECTION

Complete biochemical remission predicts histological fibrosis regression and a benign disease course of AIH

PARAGRAPH

Furthermore, we aimed to explore whether complete biochemical remission not only predicts low histological disease activity, but also fibrosis regression during follow-up.

PARAGRAPH

The fibrosis score of the total cohort remained stable (2.2 ± 1.2 (median 2) vs. 2.04 ± 1.6 (median 2); p = 0.52) over 5.5 years (range 1.0–9.7) of follow-up, 22 (37%) patients showed histological fibrosis regression or constant absence of fibrosis (F0), and 16 (26%) showed fibrosis progression.

PARAGRAPH

Stable biochemical remission was achieved in 22 patients.

Importantly, none of them showed progression of fibrosis over a median period of 5.7 years (range 1.2–15) and 15 (68%) patients showed regression of fibrosis or stable absence of fibrosis (F0).

The histological fibrosis stage in the “complete biochemical remission” group improved from 2.1 ± 1.2 (median 2) to 1.4 ± 0.7 (median 1) (p = 0.008) during 5.9 years of treatment (range: 2–13 years), whereas 43% of patients who failed to achieve stable biochemical remission showed progression of fibrosis over a median follow-up of 5.5 years (range 1.2–20.2 years).

PARAGRAPH

Of note, out of the six patients with normal serum aminotransferases but elevated IgG (partial biochemical remission), three patients showed progression of fibrosis (F0 → F2; F1 → F3, F1 → F2) during four, seven and nine years, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

In total, 29 patients were in histological remission (mHAI <4) at follow-up, which was associated with regression of fibrosis or stable absence of fibrosis (F0) in 15 (52%) patients during a median treatment time of 4.6 years (range 1–16).

Nevertheless, two patients who failed to reach complete biochemical remission, but had an mHAI of 3 developed fibrosis/cirrhosis (F0 → F2, F1 → F4) during nine years of follow-up, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

Histological remission, complete biochemical remission, serum aminotransferases or IgG levels at baseline, time to achieve initial remission, age at diagnosis and mHAI at diagnosis were assessed as predictive markers of fibrosis development by log-binomial regression.

Complete biochemical remission (relative risk [RR] 3.66; 95% CI 1.54–10.2; p = 0.001) appeared to be at least an equally strong predictor of fibrosis regression as histological remission (RR 2.96; 95% CI 1.2–9.34; p = 0.001) and, on multivariate analysis, it was the only independent factor associated with regression of fibrosis (biochemical remission: RR 2.8; 95% CI 1.15–7.85; p = 0.04; histological remission: RR 2.18; 95% CI 1.0–6.90, p = 0.08).

All other factors did not show any association with regression of fibrosis (p >0.3, respectively).

SECTION

Baseline characteristics of patients with follow-up transient elastography

PARAGRAPH

Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH cohort II).

The study cohort consisted of 125 patients with AIH, who had undergone a total of 343 TE.

The average number of TE per patient was 2.5 (range 2–5) and the average time interval between two TEs was 2.7 years (range 1–6).

PARAGRAPH

Patients were followed-up after the first TE for 4.6 years (range 1–7 years).

None of the patients required liver transplantation, suffered a liver-related death, or developed hepatic decompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocellular carcinoma) during this period.

PARAGRAPH

Seven patients (6%) received corticosteroids alone (prednisolone or budesonide), 88 (70%) patients were under azathioprine monotherapy, 21 (17%) patients had a combination therapy with azathioprine and corticosteroids and 9 (7%) patients received a second line treatment with mycophenolate mofetil or 6-mercaptopurine.

PARAGRAPH

Primary biliary cholangitis.

One hundred and thirty patients with PBC who had at least two TE were identified.

A total of 336 TEs with a median time interval of 2.7 years (range 1–7) between measurements were included.

The average number of TEs per patient was 2.9 (range 2–6).

All patients received treatment with UDCA.

PARAGRAPH

Primary sclerosing cholangitis.

One hundred patients with PSC and a total of 247 TEs were included.

The average period between measurements was 2.2 years (range 1–7) and the average number of TEs per patient was 2.5 (range 2–5).

Eighty-two (82%) patients received treatment with UDCA.

PARAGRAPH

The success rate of TE per patient was 89% (range 64–100), 91% (range 69–100) and 86% (range 62–100), and the average IQR/median ratio was 12% (range 5–29), 13% (range 5–29) and 16% (range 6–29) for AIH, PBC and PSC, respectively.

SECTION

Complete biochemical remission is associated with regression of liver stiffness in AIH (AIH cohort II)

PARAGRAPH

We investigated whether complete biochemical remission not only leads to histological fibrosis regression, but also to a reduction of LS as a surrogate of liver fibrosis in AIH.

PARAGRAPH

Changes of LS per year were calculated as percentages from baseline values.

A significant decrease of LS of −6.2%/year (95% CI −12.6% to −0.2%; p = 0.04) could be observed for the entire cohort of 125 patients with AIH.

This corresponds to an average decrease of 0.51 ± 0.43 kPa during the first year of follow-up.

PARAGRAPH

Eighty-six (86%) patients were in stable biochemical remission during follow-up and 39 (31%) patients had elevated serum aminotransferases and/or IgG levels.

PARAGRAPH

Patients in complete biochemical remission showed a considerable decrease of LS (−7.5%/year; 95% CI −11% to −2.0%; p = 0.003).

In contrast, patients who failed to achieve complete biochemical remission showed a slight but not significant increase in LS (+1.7%/year; 95% CI −6.0% to 12.1%; p = 0.19).

In patients without complete biochemical remission, 13 patients had only elevated IgG but normal serum aminotransferases (partial biochemical remission).

In these patients, changes of LS were similar to the rest of the “no biochemical remission cohort” (+1.6%/year; 95% CI −9% to 12%; p = 0.20).

PARAGRAPH

The difference between patients in complete biochemical remission and those who had elevated aminotransferases and/or IgG was significant (p <0.001) (Fig. 3).

PARAGRAPH

The time between initiation of immunosuppression and first TE (“remission”: 4.6 years (range 1–16) vs. “no remission”: 4.9 years (range 1–20); p = 0.62) and the follow-up time between TE (remission 2.7 years (range 1–5); no remission 2.7 years (range 1–6) was similar between the groups, as were LS values at baseline (remission 8.2 ± 6.7 kPa (median 7.8; range 2.7–41.6) vs. “no remission”: 8.1 ± 5.8 kPa (median 7.7; range 3.8–38.7), p = 0.96).

PARAGRAPH

Most patients in the biochemical remission group already had biochemical markers within the normal range at first TE.

In addition, during the observation period mean ALT levels remained stable in the “biochemical remission group” as well as in the “no biochemical remission group” (Table 2), suggesting a stable level of hepatic inflammation in both groups during follow-up.

There was no correlation between changes of ALT over time and variations in LS in either of the groups (“biochemical remission”: ρ = 0.11, p = 0.35; “no biochemical remission”: ρ = 0.16, p = 0.30), indicating that changes in LS reflect changes in liver fibrosis and not variations in hepatic inflammation.

Patient characteristics are displayed (Table 2).

SECTION

Regression of liver stiffness in AIH patients with cirrhosis and complete biochemical remission

PARAGRAPH

We next assessed whether TE can be used to demonstrate fibrosis regression in patients with established AIH liver cirrhosis who maintain complete biochemical remission.

To this end, the influence of fibrosis stage at baseline on fibrosis development as assessed by TE and by follow-up liver biopsy, respectively, were assessed.

PARAGRAPH

In patients with follow-up TE, fibrosis stages at baseline (as determined by TE) were distributed as follows: F0–1 in n = 46 (37%), F2 in n = 50 (40%), F3 in n = 18 (14%) and F4 in n = 11 (9%).

There was no difference in follow-up time between baseline fibrosis stages.

No significant changes in LS were detected for patients with fibrosis stage F0–1 (−0.5%/year; 95% CI −5.0% to 4.1%; p = 0.8).

However, a significant decrease in LS was found in patients with significant and advanced fibrosis (F2: −5.1%/year; 95% CI −9.9 to −0.7%; p = 0.025; F3: −8.3%/year; 95% CI −13.0 to −2.9%; p = 0.002) and especially in cirrhotic patients (F4: −11.7%/year; 95% CI −19.1% to −3.5%; p = 0.006).

Of note, all patients stratified as having cirrhosis at first TE already had histologically proven cirrhosis or at least severe fibrosis (F3) in prior liver biopsies, indicating a valid fibrosis staging by TE at study entry.

The differences in progression rates of LS between the subgroups with F0–1, F2, F3 or F4 fibrosis at study entry were significant (p <0.01).

The trends in LS progression as a function of time depending on the fibrosis stage at baseline are shown (Fig. 4).

PARAGRAPH

To confirm that severe fibrosis or cirrhosis is reversible in AIH, we investigated histological follow-up of patients with initial stage 3 or 4 disease.

17 patients had F3 (30%), and 10 patients F4 (16%) at study entry.

All ten patients with cirrhosis at study entry achieved stable biochemical remission and none of the cirrhotic patients developed hepatic decompensation or required liver transplantation during 11.3 years (range 4–20) of follow-up.

Patients with severe fibrosis (F3/F4) at study entry and biochemical remission during follow-up, showed a decrease of histological fibrosis score from 3.7 ± 0.5 (median 4) to 1.8 ± 1.7 (median 2) (p = 0.007) over 4.9 years (range 1.9–7).

PARAGRAPH

Of note, all four patients with mild persisting inflammatory activity (mHAI 4–5) despite biochemical remission showed regression of fibrosis over a median period of 4.7 years (range 2–7) and none of them suffered an adverse event during 10 years (range 8–11) of follow-up.

PARAGRAPH

Of 13 patients with initial F3 stage who did not reach complete biochemical remission, eight (62%) developed cirrhosis during a median of 5.3 years (range 1.7–13.0) of follow-up (3.0 ± 0 (median 3) vs. 3.6 ± 0.5 (median 4); p <0.0001).

In contrast, all four patients with F3 in biochemical remission showed regression of fibrosis over a time-period of four years (range 2–5).

SECTION

Liver stiffness development in AIH, PBC and PSC over time

PARAGRAPH

In order to highlight the potential of fibrosis regression once the stimulus of fibrogenesis has been eliminated, we compared the longitudinal changes of LS in AIH with the development of fibrosis in patients with the cholestatic autoimmune liver diseases PBC and PSC, in whom we usually fail to reach complete suppression of histological liver inflammation.

Patient characteristics are provided (Table 3) and changes of LS for AIH, PBC and PSC are shown (Fig. 5).

PARAGRAPH

There were no significant differences in time intervals between TE between patients with AIH, PBC and PSC.

PARAGRAPH

Patients with PSC had higher median baseline LS values than patients with AIH or PBC (p <0.01, respectively).

Baseline values of LS for the entire cohorts of patients with AIH, PBC and PSC were: 8.2 ± 6.7 kPa (median 8.5), 6.7 ± 3.5 kPa (median 6.7) and 11.2 ± 9.2 kPa (median 10.4), respectively.

As described, a significant yearly decrease in LS of 6.2%/year was observed for AIH (p = 0.04 compared to baseline), while patients with PSC showed a significant increase of 5.0%/year (95% CI −1.5% to +12.2%; p = 0.013 compared to baseline) and patients with PBC showed stable values of LS over time (−0.65%/year, 95% CI −7.4% to +6.2%; p = 0.86).

The differences in progression rates between AIH vs. PBC, AIH vs. PSC and PBC vs. PSC were statistically significant (p <0.001), underlining the different dynamics of disease progression and the effects of eliminating liver inflammation as the main stimulus for fibrosis progression.

The four-stage model, considering the fibrosis stage at baseline (as diagnosed by TE), showed a significant progression of LS from all fibrosis stages (F1-F4) in PSC, whereas in PBC no significant increase in LS could be observed irrespective of fibrosis stage at study entry.

It must be noted that only four cirrhotic patients with PBC could be included, therefore the number of patients was too small to perform a comprehensive analysis of this subgroup.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

As this study demonstrates achieving biochemical remission in AIH is a relevant treatment target.

Probably the most relevant: Biochemical remission proved to be at least as good, if not a better predictor of fibrosis regression than histological remission.

In addition, we herein establish TE as non-invasive means to monitor disease progression in patients with AIH.

Furthermore, the different dynamics of LS development between the three autoimmune liver diseases AIH, PBC and PSC are demonstrated in a large mono-centric cohort.

PARAGRAPH

The findings reported in this study underline the high potential for fibrosis regression in AIH, if liver inflammation, the main driver of fibrogenesis, is effectively controlled by immunosuppressive treatment.

PARAGRAPH

Our results are of particular clinical relevance, since data on the reliability of complete biochemical remission, defined as normal IgG and serum aminotransferases as a surrogate of a benign long-term disease have thus far been missing.

Therefore, if biochemical remission can be achieved follow-up biopsies do not need to be performed to confirm histological remission and lack of fibrosis progression.

Arguments which have been supporting the strategy of follow-up biopsies are the fluctuating disease course, which bears the risk to miss disease progression and that some patients have – usually mild – residual disease activity despite normal biochemical markers.4,20

Current guidelines define persisting disease activity as mHAI >3.6,8

However, a clear cut-off to differentiate between mild and high persisting disease activity is missing and data on the prognostic relevance of mild liver inflammation is scarce.

Consequently, mild residual disease activity has been defined inconsistently either as mHAI 4–5 or 4–6 by previous reports.4,5

A recent comprehensive study by Dhaliwal et al. found that almost half of the patients have an mHAI 4–6 when biochemical remission is defined by normal serum aminotransferases and globulins.4

This finding was associated with a significant reduction of transplant-free survival after 20 years.4

As this study did not use IgG, but rather globulins as a parameter, sensitivity and specificity might have been lower.

PARAGRAPH

In contrast, by using aminotransferases and IgG to define biochemical remission, mild persisting disease activity (mHAI 4 or 5) was only present in a small proportion of patients (18%), none of the patients had an mHAI >5 or showed progression of fibrosis.

Importantly, none of the patients with severe fibrosis at study entry who achieved complete biochemical remission reached a major endpoint such as liver transplantation or hepatic decompensation during 11.8 years (AIH cohort I) and 5.2 years (AIH cohort II) of follow-up (total follow-up 301 patient-years).

PARAGRAPH

Moreover, 68% of patients in complete biochemical remission showed histological improvement of liver fibrosis, while 43% of patients who failed to achieve biochemical remission showed progression of fibrosis.

Biochemical remission appeared to be an even stronger predictor of fibrosis regression (RR 3.66; p = 0.001) than histological remission (RR 2.96; p = 0.001), and on multivariate analysis, it was the only independent factor linked to regression of fibrosis.

This finding might be partly related to sampling errors on histological assessment.

The intensity of hepatic inflammation can vary greatly within patients with AIH, which finally results in marconodular histological changes.

Therefore, AIH might be especially prone to sampling errors.21

In addition, stable biochemical remission implicates that biochemical markers are repeatedly measured during follow-up and consequently might better reflect a stable suppression of disease activity than liver biopsy.

PARAGRAPH

In line with these findings, a considerable decrease of LS could be observed when patients in complete biochemical remission were compared to those who had elevated serum aminotransferases and/or IgG levels during follow-up (“remission”: −7.5%/year vs. “no remission”: +1.7%/year; p <0.0001).

PARAGRAPH

We could only include six patients with normal serum aminotransferases but elevated IgG (partial biochemical remission) in AIH cohort I, therefore this subgroup analyses is strongly affected by the limited number of patients.

Nevertheless, three of these six patients had relevant persisting disease activity and developed fibrosis or cirrhosis during follow-up.

Moreover, progression rate of LS in patients (AIH cohort II) in partial biochemical remission was similar to that of the rest of the “no biochemical remission group”.

PARAGRAPH

We have demonstrated previously, that hepatic inflammation in patients with AIH treated for at least six months and not suffering a severe flare is usually not sufficiently severe to have a significant impact on LS.9

In this setting, LS is a reliable surrogate for histological staging, but not grading, in the majority of patients.9

This finding has been confirmed in a recent study,10 in which LS in patients with AIH and an mHAI >2 or ALT >2xULN was not significantly higher than in patients with mHAI ≤2 or ALT <2xULN.10

Since patients included in our study had at most moderately elevated biochemical markers and first TE was performed years after the initiation of immunosuppressive treatment, variations of LS likely reflect changes of fibrosis.

In addition, a potential bias due to hepatic inflammation seems unlikely, since biochemical markers in the “biochemical remission group” and the “no remission group” did not alter during follow-up, hence one can assume that the level of inflammatory activity remained stable in both groups.

PARAGRAPH

Taken together, these results confirm the importance of achieving and monitoring complete biochemical remission in patients with AIH and underline that suppression of hepatic inflammation is crucial to prevent fibrosis progression.22–24

PARAGRAPH

We believe the reported results strongly indicate that follow-up biopsies in patients in stable, complete biochemical remission are not warranted because the chance of relevant disease activity or disease progression is low.

Nevertheless, AIH is characterised by a fluctuating disease course, and consequently, flares and disease progression might be missed, if biochemical markers are monitored infrequently.

In addition, it is unclear whether the small proportion of patients with mild persisting inflammatory activity despite biochemical remission have an increased risk of adverse outcome after a longer follow-up of 20 years.4

Therefore, we believe that yearly follow-up TE in addition to complete biochemical remission may help to assure a lack of disease progression over the long-term and thereby, may reduce the need for follow-up liver biopsy.

Conversely, patients who fail to achieve complete biochemical remission have a relevant risk of disease progression and therefore, may require an intensified immunosuppression.

If this is not feasible, e.g. due to treatment side effects, the threshold to perform a liver biopsy to assess disease activity and progression should be low.

In these cases, an increase of LS may support such a strict strategy, while in other patients improved LS may allow a more observant approach.

In contrast to PBC and PSC, we observed a considerable reduction of LS and histological fibrosis score in patients with AIH and severe fibrosis or cirrhosis at baseline, who maintained complete biochemical remission during follow-up.

As about one-third of patients with AIH already have cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis,20,25 this is a very encouraging finding and highlights the importance of eliminating liver inflammation as a main stimulus for fibrogenesis on the one hand.

On the other hand, it shows the potential for matrix remodelling even in the setting of cirrhosis, as has been demonstrated for other chronic liver diseases such as hepatitis B.26

Interestingly, it has been described that patients with persisting histological disease activity despite biochemical remission had higher serum aminotransferases than those who attained histological remission.4

These results indicate that variations within the normal range reflect differences in disease activity.

In accordance with these findings we have reported previously that ALT levels less than half the ULN and IgG levels not higher than 12 g/L at the time of treatment withdrawal in AIH were associated with a high chance of sustained remission off treatment.27

Therefore, it may be noteworthy that all patients who fulfilled these criteria at the time of repeat biopsy showed histological remission (mHAI ≤3).

In addition, the small number of patients with persisting disease activity (mHAI 4 or 5) despite biochemical remission tended to have higher serum aminotransferases than those in histological remission (median ALT 21 U/L vs. 31 U/L; p = 0.09).

PARAGRAPH

This study has some limitations worth considering.

Firstly, the study is hampered by the obvious limitations of being a retrospective single-centre analysis.

Secondly, subgroup analysis is affected by the limited numbers of patients.

Thirdly, this study has been performed at an expert centre with a specialised, high volume outpatient clinic for autoimmune liver diseases.

Consequently, our results might not be completely reproducible under less ideal, different conditions, in which aminotransferases and IgG might be less closely monitored.

However, at the same time our results provide evidence for excellent results in specialty centres arguing for provision of such services for patients with AIH in general.

Finally, TE is still a rather new method in AIH.

Besides our previous study,9 there has been only one further report, which correlated LS with histological findings.10

In line with our results, this study could confirm the accuracy of TE to assess liver fibrosis in AIH.

Nevertheless, this method has so far been examined in a limited number of patients with AIH, and therefore, results should be interpreted with caution until reproduced by others.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, effective suppression of hepatic inflammation in patients with AIH, using sufficient immunosuppressive treatment is associated with regression of fibrosis, particularly in patients with advanced fibrosis stages.

Importantly, complete biochemical remission defined as normalisation of aminotransferases and IgG is confirmed as a surrogate of low histological disease activity and a beneficial disease course.

Finally, we have established TE as a non-invasive tool to monitor fibrosis development in AIH.

These findings are of direct clinical relevance, and may reduce the need for follow-up liver biopsy in the future.
