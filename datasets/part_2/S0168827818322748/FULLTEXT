TITLE

Modified PAGE-B score predicts the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in Asians with chronic hepatitis B on antiviral therapy

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Approximately 240 million people are diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) worldwide, and the highest prevalence is found in Africa and Asia.1

Early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) improves patients’ prognosis through timely intervention,2 and it is therefore important to stratify the risk of HCC in patients with CHB.

PARAGRAPH

To date, three conventional models have been used for the prediction of HCC development in patients with CHB, including the modified guide with age, gender, HBV DNA, and cirrhosis-HCC (GAG-HCC), the Chinese University-HCC (CU-HCC), and the risk estimation for hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic hepatitis B (REACH-B).3

The proportions of patients with CHB treated with antiviral therapy during the study periods for modified GAG-HCC, CU-HCC, and REACH-B models were 15.1%, 0%, and 0%, respectively, and all patients were treatment-naïve.3,4

Furthermore, the patients enrolled in the study of the REACH-B model did not have cirrhosis.

Given that HCC risk can be changed in patients with CHB treated with nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) antiviral therapy compared with untreated patients,5 the accuracy of the three scores for the prediction of HCC development may be limited in patients with CHB treated with antiviral therapy.

PARAGRAPH

Recently, the PAGE-B score was developed for Caucasian patients with CHB treated with antiviral therapies such as entecavir (ETV) or tenofovir (TDF).

The PAGE-B score showed an excellent concordance index value of 0.81 for the prediction of HCC development by five years in the original study.6

In addition, Toronto HCC risk index (THRI) was also introduced to predict HCC development in patients with cirrhosis according to various etiologies including CHB.7

Although the study suggested using THRI for patients with CHB regardless of potent antiviral therapy in Western countries, it also showed a good concordance index value of 0.77 for the prediction of HCC development.7

It is necessary to validate the two scores in Asian patients with CHB receiving potent antiviral therapy.

PARAGRAPH

Of note, in the initial process of developing the PAGE-B score and THRI which in common were composed of age, gender, and platelet counts in the original studies, the impact of some variables on the development of HCC and interaction with each variable, such as serum albumin, total bilirubin, creatinine levels, aspartate/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT), and international normalized ratio for prothrombin time (INR) was not well evaluated in univariable and multivariable analyses.6,7

Among the various serum variables, previous studies have shown that serum bilirubin or albumin levels were independently associated with HCC development in patients with CHB.8–12

PARAGRAPH

Thus, our study aimed to investigate whether readily available laboratory parameters can significantly enhance the predictive performance of the scores composed of age, gender and platelets for HCC development or not, and to validate the PAGE-B and THRI in Asian patients with CHB, and to compare it with other conventional prediction models.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Patients

PARAGRAPH

A retrospective cohort study including 3,001 consecutively registered patients with CHB who were treated with antiviral therapy at four tertiary hospitals in the Republic of Korea (Kangwon National University Hospital, Gangneung Asan Hospital, Wonju Severance Christian Hospital, Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital) from January 2007 to June 2016 was conducted.

Patients were included if they were ≥18 years old, Asian, and under antiviral treatment with ETV or TDF for ≥1 year.

Patients naïve to or who had previously received antiviral treatment with other NAs were also included.

Patients diagnosed with HCC before the start of ETV/TDF treatment, patients co-infected with hepatitis C, hepatitis D, or human immunodeficiency virus, and patients with active alcoholism, moderate or severe fatty liver on ultrasonography, and liver transplant were excluded (Fig. 1).

The study protocol complied with the ethical guidelines of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each hospital.

SECTION

Clinical evaluation and follow-up

PARAGRAPH

Chronic hepatitis B was diagnosed in patients who had been HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) positive for ≥6 months, elevated serum ALT levels and serum HBV DNA levels >2,000 IU/ml.

Clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis was determined as follows: (i) platelet count of <100,000/ml and ultrasonography findings suggestive of cirrhosis, including a blunted, nodular liver edge accompanied by splenomegaly (>12 cm) or (ii) clinical signs of portal hypertension, such as ascites, esophageal or gastric varices, and hepatic encephalopathy.13,14

The diagnosis of HCC was established using standard histological and/or compatible radiological findings in the current guidelines of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.13,15

The diagnosis of HCC was based on the radiologic findings of dynamic computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging that included intense arterial uptake followed by a “washout” of contrast in the venous-delayed phases.

For patients who had equivocal findings in the CT scan, an MRI with liver-specific contrast was performed to diagnose HCC.

If there were no characteristic findings of HCC in the MRI, we performed a liver biopsy.

In this study, all images used for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis and HCC were reviewed by two expert radiologists with >10 years of experience in each hospital.

In cases of discordance, an additional third independent experienced radiologist reviewed the images, and consensus was achieved among the three.

The primary diagnosis of HCC in patients who were completely followed up in this study was also confirmed using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database.

For patients lost to follow-up, data collection for HCC diagnosis was performed using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database.

The Korean National Health Insurance Service database has a high HCC registration rate (96.5%) and highly accurate diagnoses; in addition, it has been endorsed as a valid resource for research.16

PARAGRAPH

All patients received antiviral treatment with ETV and/or TDF and were followed-up according to the clinical practice guidelines.17

Clinical examinations, routine laboratory tests including HBV DNA levels, and ultrasonography and/or serum alpha-fetoprotein levels were performed every six months.

Index date was defined as the date of the start of ETV/TDF treatment.

Follow-up was defined as the time interval between the index date and the last available clinical information until June 2017, while treatment period was defined as the time interval between the index date until the end of treatment or the last on-therapy follow-up.

Analysis time was defined as the time interval between the index date and the time of HCC development or the end of follow-up in the absence of HCC development.

Patients who were considered to be at risk of HCC beyond year 4 were all those who had been followed while receiving ETV/TDF for >4 years and who had not developed HCC within the first four years of therapy because a median follow-up period in this study was 4.1 years (interquartile [IQR], 2.8–5.7 years).

SECTION

Serum assays

PARAGRAPH

Serum HBV DNA levels were measured in a real-time PCR assay using either Roche COBAS TaqMan (lower limit of detection 20 IU/ml; Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ) or Abbott m2000 (lower limit of detection 15 IU/ml; Abbott Diagnostics, Chicago, IL).18

Results are expressed in IU/ml after appropriate data transformation.19

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

The Student’s t test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Kruskal-Wallis test was used for the comparison of continuous variables.

The Pearson chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test, or linear-by-linear association was performed for the categorical variables.

The cumulative incidence rates of HCC development were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using the log-rank test.

Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the effect of various factors on the risk of HCC development.

A p value less than 0.05 was considered to have a statistical significance.

PARAGRAPH

The prediction model was developed to predict the HCC development within five years after the start of ETV/TDF treatment.

The study population was divided into the derivation set and the validation set (2:1 ratio) by simple random sampling.

The development of our HCC risk score was based on a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model using data in the derivation set.

To assess the predictive performance of the model, discrimination and calibration measures were also examined.

Accuracy in predicting HCC development was evaluated using a time-dependent area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve at five years.20

Pairwise comparison of AUROC values for competing prognostic systems was achieved using the DeLong test.21

The cut-off values for CU-HCC score, GAG-HCC score, REACH-B score, THRI, and PAGE-B score were selected as recommended from the original studies.6,22–24

A calibration plot was used to evaluate the agreement between the five-year probabilities of HCC development as predicted by the model and observed probabilities using the Kaplan-Meier analysis.

AUROC values of 0.7–0.8 are considered good, while >0.8 are considered excellent.

PARAGRAPH

A validity evaluation of the prediction model using internal and external validation was performed.

Internal validation was performed using bootstrap methods: repeatedly fitting the prediction model in 1,000 bootstrap samples and evaluating the performance of the model in the original sample.

Regarding external validation, the prediction model developed in the derivation dataset was applied to the validation set: the predictive performance of the model was also assessed in the validation set.

Then, a risk score was developed based on a points system to simplify the calculation of HCC risk estimate (Table S1).25

All statistical analyses were conducted using the R statistical programming environment (v3.3.0; http://www.r-project.org).

Results

SECTION

Baseline characteristics

PARAGRAPH

There were 2,001 patients in the derivation set and 1,000 patients in the validation set.

The patients in the two sets were similar in their characteristics at the start of ETV/TDF treatment (Table 1).

Among 2,001 patients in the derivation set, 1,282 patients (64.1%) were male and 383 patients (19.1%) were diagnosed with cirrhosis.

The median age was 50 (IQR 42–57) years.

A total of 678 patients (33.9%) were HBV e antigen (HBeAg) positive.

The median HBV DNA level was 1,000 IU/ml.

Serum albumin levels and platelet counts were 4.2 g/dl (IQR 3.9–4.4) and 158 × 109/L (IQR 115 × 109/L–202 × 109/L), respectively.

Median values of Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) and model for end-stage liver disease scores were 5 (IQR 5–5) and 8 (IQR 7.0–9.4), respectively.

The median GAG-HCC, CU-HCC, REACH-B, THRI, and PAGE-B scores in the derivation set were 74.0, 4.5, 9, 227, and 14, respectively.

The validation set (n = 1,000) had similar baseline characteristics compared to the training set (all p >0.05; Table 1).

In the derivation set, 791 of 2,001 patients (39.5%) were treated with nucleos(t)ide analogs before ETV/TDF therapy, while 396 of 1,000 patients (39.6%) were treated with nucleos(t)ide analogs before ETV/TDF therapy in the validation set.

PARAGRAPH

During the follow-up period (median 49 months, IQR, 33–68 months), HCC was diagnosed in 132 (6.6%) patients in the derivation and 72 (7.2%) patients in the validation set.

According to PAGE-B risk group, HCC was diagnosed in 2 of 365 (0.5%) patients in the derivation set and 2 of 184 (1.1%) patients in the validation set in the low-risk group, 48 of 1,076 (4.5%) patients in the derivation set and 27 of 545 (5.0%) patients in the validation set in the intermediate-risk group, and 81 of 560 (14.5%) patients in the derivation set and 43 of 271 (15.9%) patients in the validation set in the high-risk group.

According to THRI risk group, HCC was diagnosed in 1 of 126 (0.8%) patients in the derivation set and 1 of 76 (1.3%) patients in the validation set in the low-risk group, 33 of 1,012 (3.3%) patients in the derivation set and 16 of 502 (3.2%) patients in the validation set in the intermediate-risk group, and 98 of 863 (11.4%) patients in the derivation set and 55 of 422 (13.0%) patients in the validation set in the high-risk group.

Predictors of HCC development within five years after the start of ETV/TDF treatment

PARAGRAPH

In the univariable analysis, older age, male gender, cirrhosis status, HBeAg positivity, lower serum albumin levels, higher INR, and lower platelet counts significantly predicted HCC development in the derivation set (n = 2,001) (all, p <0.05; Table 2).

A subsequent multivariable analysis revealed that older age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.07; 95% CI 1.05–1.09; p <0.001), male gender (HR 2.55; 95% CI 1.70–3.83; p <0.001), lower serum albumin levels (HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.35–0.76; p <0.001), and lower platelet counts (HR 0.989; 95% CI 0.985–0.993; p <0.001) were independent predictors of HCC development (Table 2).

PARAGRAPH

In the derivation set, the proportion of patients with HCC development was significantly greater in the patients with lower serum albumin levels (p <0.001 for trend; Fig. 2A).

The cumulative incidence rates of HCC significantly increased in association with lower serum albumin levels among the three stratified groups (p <0.001 by log-rank test; Fig. 2B): the cumulative incidence rates of HCC at five years were 4.6%, 8.3%, and 17.5% in patients with serum albumin levels >4.0 g/dl, 3.5–4.0 g/dl, and ≤3.5 g/dl, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

Age, gender, serum albumin levels, and platelet counts were selected to generate modified PAGE-B scores (mPAGE-B).

The calibration plot was presented (Fig. S1).

The mPAGE-B scores were simplified to an integer scoring system as the sum of each score, ranging from 0 to 21 in the form of the original PAGE-B scores with the addition of the serum albumin levels (Table 3).

The time-dependent AUROC of the new model for predicting HCC development at five years was 0.82 (95% CI 0.78–0.86) in the derivation set.

Internal validation using bootstrap methods was performed, and the resulting time-dependent AUROC was 0.81 (95% CI 0.78–0.85).

Among the 2,001 patients in the derivation set, the time-dependent AUROC of mPAGE-B score was 0.81 in 1,210 NA(s) naïve patients and 0.78 in 791 patients who had previously received antiviral treatment with other NAs before the start of ETV/TDF treatment, as well as 0.80 and 0.78 in 1,618 patients without cirrhosis, or 383 patients with cirrhosis at the start of ETV/TDF treatment, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

The discrimination of the mPAGE-B score was assessed by inspection of the Kaplan-Meier curves for each risk group stratified by the 25th (9 points) and 75th percentiles (12 points) of the risk score distribution in the derivation set.

Patients were stratified into three groups; low- (score ≤8), intermediate- (score 9–12), and high-risk groups (score ≥13) (Table S1).

Among 2,001 patients in the derivation set, 448 (22.4%) had low (≤8), 933 (46.6%) had intermediate (9–12), and 620 (31.0%) had high (≥13) mPAGE-B score.

The five-year cumulative probabilities of HCC development in the patients in the low (≤8), intermediate (9–12), and high (≥13) mPAGE-B score groups were 0.7%, 5.1%, and 18.4%, respectively (p <0.001 by log-rank test; Fig. 2C).

The cut-off value that maximizes both sensitivity and specificity of the mPAGE-B risk score for the prediction of HCC development at five years is 13 (sensitivity 72.4%, specificity 71.7%, positive predictive value 14.4%, negative predictive value 97.5%) in the derivation set.

SECTION

Validation of predictive performances of risk models for HCC development

PARAGRAPH

In the validation set (n = 1,000), mPAGE-B scores offered similarly excellent predictability of HCC as the time-dependent AUROC: 0.82 (95% CI 0.76–0.88; Fig. 2D).

The calibration plot of the model was shown (Fig. S1).

The five-year cumulative probabilities of HCC in patients in the low (≤8, n = 235), intermediate (9–12, n = 472), and high (≥13, n = 293) mPAGE-B score groups were 1.9%, 6.5%, and 18.2%, respectively (p <0.001; Fig. 2E).

The predictive performance of the mPAGE-B scores for HCC development at five years was significantly higher than that of PAGE-B, CU-HCC, GAG-HCC, and REACH-B models (all, p <0.01; Table 4).

PARAGRAPH

The time-dependent AUROC of PAGE-B scores for HCC development at five years was 0.72 (95% CI 0.65–0.78), and was not significantly different from that of other HCC risk models except the REACH-B model.

A significant difference in the time-dependent AUROCs between the PAGE-B score and REACH-B model was observed (p = 0.03; Table 4).

SECTION

Decrease of HCC risk during long-term treatment of ETV/TDF according to mPAGE-B risk groups

PARAGRAPH

During the median follow-up period of 4.1 years, HCC risk was compared between the first four years after the start of ETV/TDF treatment and beyond the first four years of the antiviral treatment.

HCC was diagnosed in 178 (5.9%) of 3,001 patients within the first four years after ETV/TDF onset and in 26 (1.9%) of the 1,370 patients remaining at risk beyond the first four years of therapy.

PARAGRAPH

In each risk group stratified by mPAGE-B score, HCC risk was significantly decreased in long-term therapy of ETV/TDF.

In total study population, the yearly HCC incidence rates significantly decreased after four years of therapy with ETV/TDF, compared to the first four years of therapy initiation (1.9%; 95% CI 1.6%–2.2% vs. 0.3%; 95% CI 0.2%–0.5%; p <0.001).

In the low-risk group according to mPAGE scores, the yearly HCC incidence rates after the first four years of therapy were significantly decreased compared to those within the first four years of therapy (0.2%; 95% CI 0.1%–0.5% vs. 0.0%; 95% CI 0.0%–0.2%; p = 0.03; Fig. 3).

In the intermediate-risk group according to mPAGE scores, the yearly HCC incidence rates after the first four years of therapy initiation were significantly decreased compared to those within the first four years of therapy initiation (1.1%; 95% CI 0.8%–1.5% vs. 0.2%; 95% CI 0.1%–0.3%; p <0.001; Fig. 3).

In the high-risk group according to mPAGE scores, the yearly HCC incidence rates after the first four years of therapy were significantly decreased compared to those within the first four years of therapy (4.6%; 95% CI 3.8%–5.5% vs. 1.0%; 95% CI 0.6%–1.5%; p <0.001; Fig. 3).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Although the PAGE-B score showed excellent predictive performance for predicting five-year HCC development in Caucasian patients with CHB treated with ETV/TDF,6 the PAGE-B score in two previous validation studies in Asian patients with CHB did not show excellent predictive performance for HCC development:26,27 one study concluded that the predictive performance of PAGE-B was similar to that of the CU-HCC and GAG-HCC models.27

Recently, THRI was also developed in Western areas and showed good predictive performance of HCC development in Western areas.7

Although THRI in prediction of HCC risk was developed in all cirrhotic patients with or without ETV/TDF therapy who had different baseline characteristics from those in the study for development of PAGE-B, THRI was composed of the same variables, such as age, gender, and platelets as those in the PAGE-B score.7

It had not yet been validated in Asian patients with CHB under potent antiviral therapy.

PARAGRAPH

Because HCC risk in patients with CHB is varying according to race,28 the predictive performance of PAGE-B and THRI for HCC development in Asian patients can be different from those in studies performed in Western areas.

Given the high prevalence of CHB in Asian areas, PAGE-B and THRI need validation in patients with CHB under potent antiviral therapy.

Thus, this study was performed to validate the PAGE-B score and THRI in large multicenter cohorts of Asian patients with CHB receiving ETV/TDF therapy, as well as to demonstrate how to enhance the predictive performance of the scores using simple clinical parameters.

In the original study used to develop the PAGE-B score and THRI,6,7 effects and interactions of readily available individual serum parameters in total such as serum albumin, INR, creatinine, and bilirubin levels had not been assessed in the univariable and multivariable analyses used to build the model.6,7

PARAGRAPH

In this study, among various serum markers, the serum albumin level was an independent predictor of HCC development at five years while maintaining the significance of common variables in both the PAGE-B score and THRI such as age, gender, and platelet counts.

Thus, we developed mPAGE-B scores, which incorporated serum albumin levels into the model that included the variables of age, gender, and platelets in the original PAGE-B score and THRI.

The mPAGE-B scores significantly enhanced the predictability of the original PAGE-B score and THRI for five-year HCC development, and showed significantly higher predictive performance for five-year HCC development compared with the GAG-HCC, CU-HCC, and REACH-B models.

PARAGRAPH

Consistent with a previous Asian validation study,29 the predictability of PAGE-B scores for HCC development at five years in this study was not significantly higher than that of the two scores such as GAG-HCC and CU-HCC.

Although all of three models showed good predictive performance (AUROC >0.7) of HCC development, the reason for different predictive performance of the PAGE-B scores in Asian patients with CHB compared to Western populations remains unclear.

It may be explained in part by the difference of HBV genotypes between Western and Eastern areas: genotypes A/D/G are widespread in Europe and the United States; genotypes B/C are common in Asia.30,31

Given that the relationship between HBV genotypes, progression of hepatitis B disease, and clinical outcomes has developed over time,32 a difference in the predictiveness of the PAGE-B scores in patients with CHB between Western and Eastern areas may occur.

PARAGRAPH

Our study has several strengths.

The mPAGE-B score was derived from large multicenter cohorts of patients observed for a long period of time.

The large number of patients developing HCC allowed accurate evaluation of different risk factors.

The four parameters used in the mPAGE-B score (age, gender, serum albumin levels, platelets) are commonly measured in clinic, and the simple calculation of the score could facilitate implementation of routine clinical use.

Of note, in the low-risk group according to mPAGE-B scores (≤8, 22.7% in total population), yearly HCC incidence rates were 0.2% in this study.

Given that HCC surveillance in cirrhotic patients would be warranted if the HCC incidence is at least 1.5%/year,33 cirrhotic patients with CHB under ETV/TDF treatment who belong in the low-risk group may be considered to avoid frequent HCC surveillance such as biannual surveillance.

In contrast, in high-risk group according to mPAGE-B scores (≥13, 30.4% in total population), yearly HCC incidence rates were 4.6% in this study.

High-risk patients had an increased HCC risk and required stringent and careful surveillance.

A previous study suggested that, in patients with cirrhosis at high-risk of HCC, screening that used MRI with liver-specific contrast resulted in a higher HCC detection rate, and most of the HCCs detected were at a very early stage, which was associated with a high chance of curative treatments and favorable survival of patients.34

Thus, new individualized strategies for each HCC risk should be considered rather than uniform surveillance strategies irrespective of HCC risk.

PARAGRAPH

Interestingly, a recent study indicated that HCC risk decreased after the first five years of ETV/TDF in Caucasian patients with CHB.35

In this study, we validated that HCC incidence rates in long-term therapy of ETV/TDF were also significantly decreased compared to those within short-term therapy of ETV/TDF in all risk groups of the mPAGE-B scores in Asian patients with CHB.

This result had a clinically important meaning that yearly HCC risk can be reduced, not increased over time if patients keep potent antiviral therapy in long-term periods.

In other words, the non-occurrence of HCC within 4–5 years after potent antiviral therapy can be itself a good prognostic factor for HCC risk.

It can therefore be useful for clinical guidance to perform surveillance regularly in patients with CHB patients beyond year 4 based on reduced yearly HCC risk of each CHB patient.

Because both of PAGE-B scores and THRI had a changeable variable such as age, it might be a concern that HCC risk in patients with CHB would increase as patients treated with potent antiviral therapy got older.

However, in this study, HCC risk even in high-risk patients was reduced as patients were getting older.

It indicates that long-term benefits from maintaining potent antiviral therapy outweigh increased HCC risk over time in long-term periods.

PARAGRAPH

Our study has a few limitations.

Firstly, HCC was diagnosed by ultrasonographic findings performed by different radiologists or hepatologists, and the compliance to HCC surveillance might have varied across the centers.

Thus, the diagnosis of HCC could have been delayed in some cases.

However, such situations reflect daily clinical practice and exist in most multicenter cohort studies in a large scale.

Second, the diagnosis of cirrhosis was based on radiological, endoscopic findings, and/or clinical circumstances.

However, such an approach to the clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis can be closer to what is used in a real-life setting.

Furthermore, the fact that cirrhosis was not included in the mPAGE-B, original PAGE-B scores, or THRI most likely represents a great advantage that might be a major hurdle that would be difficult to overcome in retrospective multicenter cohort studies such as this study.

In addition, it did not take into account the effect of the potential regression of histological cirrhosis, which can be achieved in the majority of patients with CHB after five years of NA therapy.

In a large cohort in a real-life setting, it is difficult to perform paired liver biopsies and fibroscan exams in all patients before and after long-term antiviral treatment.

Finally, recent studies have reported that serum HBsAg levels, HBV genotypes, sub-genotypes, and core promoter mutations may represent significant factors related to the HCC risk in patients with CHB.36,37

Unfortunately, the tests for serum HBsAg levels and genetic studies were not available for the majority of patients in this study, and therefore, the effect of such factors on the HCC risk could not be assessed in this study.

However, the tests for these predictors are not easily accessible in primary care setting; thus, these predictors will be less helpful to general practitioners taking care of patients with chronic hepatitis infection.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, mPAGE-B scores composed of common variables of PAGE-B scores and THRI such as age, gender, and platelet count and a new variable of serum albumin levels at baseline can predict HCC development during the first five years of ETV/TDF therapy in Asian patients with CHB.

The decline in the HCC risk in long-term ETV/TDF therapy was also confirmed in Asian patients with CHB.

The mPAGE-B score and risk stratification can be a useful tool to guide appropriate strategies for clinicians in the surveillance of HCC.

Further studies are needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of biannual HCC surveillance strategies in terms of the early detection of HCC in low-risk and high-risk patients.
