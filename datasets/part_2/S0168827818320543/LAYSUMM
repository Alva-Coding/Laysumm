TITLE

Liver regeneration requires Yap1-TGFÎ²-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocytes

PARAGRAPH

The adult liver has an extraordinary ability to regenerate after injury despite the accumulation of scar-forming factors that normally block the proliferation and reduce the survival of residual liver cells.

We discovered that liver cells manage to escape these growth-inhibitory influences by transiently becoming more like fibroblasts themselves.

They do this by reactivating programs that are known to drive tissue growth during fetal development and in many cancers.

Understanding how the liver can control programs that are involved in scarring and cancer may help in the development of new treatments for cirrhosis and liver cancer.
