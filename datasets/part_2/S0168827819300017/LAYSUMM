TITLE

Outcomes of radiofrequency ablation as first-line therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma less than 3 cm in potentially transplantable patients

PARAGRAPH

Radiofrequency ablation and liver transplantation are treatment options for early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

After ablation some patients will experience recurrence or metastatic spread of the initial tumor or may develop new tumors within the liver.

Despite close follow-up, these recurrences can progress rapidly and exceed transplant criteria, preventing the patient from receiving a transplant.

We identified that patients with HCC >2â€¯cm and higher serum alpha-fetoprotein are at greater risk of recurrence beyond the transplant criteria.

These data suggest that liver transplantation should be considered immediately after the first HCC recurrence for these patients.
