TITLE

Apoptosis of enterocytes and nitration of junctional complex proteins promote alcohol-induced gut leakiness and liver injury

PARAGRAPH

Binge alcohol exposure causes gut leakiness, contributing to increased endotoxemia and inflammatory liver injury.

Our results demonstrated for the first time the critical roles of apoptosis of enterocytes and nitration followed by ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic degradation of the junctional complex proteins in promoting this gut leakiness and endotoxemia.

These results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of alcohol-induced inflammatory liver disease.
