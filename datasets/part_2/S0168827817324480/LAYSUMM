TITLE

Association of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with subclinical myocardial dysfunction in non-cirrhotic patients

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

More severe forms of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, where hepatic fibrosis occurs, are linked to increased mortality.

In this study, we have shown that hepatic steatosis and fibrosis are associated with subclinical myocardial dysfunction.

This association is linked to altered myocardial glucose uptake.
