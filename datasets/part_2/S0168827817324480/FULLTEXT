TITLE

Association of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with subclinical myocardial dysfunction in non-cirrhotic patients

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a common metabolic liver disease worldwide, with an estimated prevalence ranging from 25% to 45% in Asian as well as Western countries.1,2

NAFLD is defined as accumulation of lipids, mainly triglycerides, in ≥5% of hepatocytes with no evidence of excessive alcohol consumption or other secondary causes.3

The NAFLD spectrum ranges from simple steatosis, a benign disease with absence of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), an aggressive condition that can develop into cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality.4,5

A recent meta-analysis reported that in patients with NASH, 35% progressed to cirrhosis in an average of seven years, often followed by liver-related complications.6

PARAGRAPH

Surprisingly, the most common cause of death in patients with NAFLD is cardiovascular disease, not liver-associated complications.7

Individuals with NASH showed much higher risk of coronary artery disease-related mortality (12% to 16%)8,9 compared to those with NAFLD (1% to 3%),10,11 indicating a dose-dependent relationship between severity of NAFLD and risk of cardiovascular disease mortality.

There are several possible mechanisms to explain cross-talk between the heart and liver.

Small studies previously demonstrated that fatty liver was associated with insulin resistance in myocardium,12 altered left ventricular (LV) structure, and diastolic dysfunction.13,14

Myocardium requires energy from fatty acids and glucose, which can be altered in patients with insulin resistant conditions,15 resulting in transformation of myocardial structures and function.

These myocardial abnormalities may progress to diastolic heart failure, which is increasing in prevalence because of rising rates of obesity and diabetes in aging societies.16

Diastolic heart failure, along with preserved ejection fraction (EF) and predominant abnormality in diastolic function,17 has a mortality risk similar to systolic heart failure.18

However, there has been no study evaluating the association between NAFLD, especially NASH or hepatic fibrosis, and subclinical abnormalities in myocardial structure and function.

PARAGRAPH

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the association between hepatic steatosis and fibrosis with early changes in myocardial structure and function in relation to myocardial glucose uptake assessed by using [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) in a population-based cohort.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Study participants

PARAGRAPH

The present study population consisted of asymptomatic patients who visited the health promotion center in Severance Hospital, a university-affiliated tertiary care hospital, for comprehensive health examinations.

Details of this study protocol were previously described.19

Among 387 patients, we excluded individuals who had abnormal renal or hepatic functions, history of cardiovascular diseases including myocardial infarction, and heart failure (n = 20) or had a coronary artery calcium score greater than 400, evaluated by coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography, indicating subclinical coronary artery disease20 (n = 23), or had a history of heavy alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis B or C (n = 13), or did not undergo transient elastography (n = 50).

Finally, a total of 308 subjects were included in the present study.

This study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea (IRB No. 4-2015-0876).

SECTION

Measurements and definitions of clinical and laboratory parameters

PARAGRAPH

All participants provided data including personal and/or familial medical history, amounts of alcohol and smoking consumption, and use of medication at the time of their enrolment.

Smoking habits were grouped as never or ever smoker.

Blood samples were collected from each participant after overnight fasting, 2 h postprandial.

Detailed methods regarding measurements of body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and laboratory profiles such as glycaemic, lipidemic, and hepatic parameters were performed as described in the previous study.19

Subjects were considered as overweight or obese when BMI was 23 to 25 g/m2 or ≥25 g/m2, respectively, based on the criteria of the Asian-Pacific region.21

Diabetes was defined according to the 2014 revision of the American Diabetes Association guidelines.22

The estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was derived from the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation.

Fatty liver index (FLI) and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) were calculated to assess hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, respectively.

SECTION

Echocardiography

PARAGRAPH

Comprehensive echocardiography, including M-mode, pulsed Doppler and tissue Doppler imaging, was conducted by experienced sonographers as recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography23 using a Vivid 7, GE Vingmed Ultrasound AS, Horten, Norway) with a 2.5 Hz probe.

As described in detail previously,24 the Severance Cardiovascular center performed quality control and image analysis.

Using the method described by Devereux et al.25, LV mass was determined and left atrial (LA) volume was measured from the parasternal long-axis view and apical four-chamber view using the prolate ellipse method; LV mass index and LA volume index were calculated by dividing the LV mass and LA volume, respectively, by body surface area.26

Mitral valve inflow was measured by Doppler echocardiography from the apical four-chamber view; the Doppler beam was aligned parallel to the direction of flow and with a 1–2 m sample volume placed between the tips of the mitral leaflets during diastole.

Mitral inflow profiles were used to measure peak velocities at the early (E) and late (A) diastole, along with deceleration time (DT).

Septal tissue imaging by Doppler was also obtained using the apical four-chamber view, and the two values were averaged to evaluate the early (E’) and late (A’) diastolic peak velocities.

Increased LV filling pressure was defined as early trans-mitral velocity ratio (E)/e’ ≥15 alone, or the combination of E/e’ ratio 8–15 and left atrial (LA) volume index ≥34 l/m2.26,27

Measurements were obtained in end-systole from the frame preceding mitral valve opening.

SECTION

Measurements of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis using transient elastography

PARAGRAPH

In all participants abdominal ultrasonography was performed, using a 3.5-MHz transducer, by trained radiologists who were blinded to the patients’ clinical and laboratory data to rule out other liver disorders.28

The severity of fatty liver was categorized into four grades: absent, mild, moderate, and severe, based on the liver-kidney difference in echo amplitude caused by abnormally intense echoes arising from the hepatic parenchyma because of liver fat, echo attenuation by fat into the deep portion of liver, and blurring of the blood vessel structures in the liver, as previously described.29,30

Then, we finally defined the status of fatty liver as presence vs. absence.

The principles of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measurement using TE have been described previously.31,32

In this study, TE was conducted by an experienced technician (>10,000 examinations) who was blinded to clinical patient data.

Results are expressed as kilopascals (kPa) for LSM and dB/m for CAP.

For the CAP assessment, we used a Fibroscan 501® (Echosens, Paris, France) and placed the tip of the M probe on the skin, between the ribs, over the right lobe of the liver.

As an indicator of variability, we calculated the ratio of the interquartile range (IQR) of LSM to the median.

To ensure accuracy of the CAP value, we calculated ultrasound attenuation only when the matched LSM was valid, and we attempted to collect ≥10 valid LSMs.

A ≥60% success rate and a ≤30% ratio of IQR to median LSM (IQR/MLSM) were deemed reliable.

The CAP was considered a valid value only when LSM was reliable for the same signal, at the same volume of liver parenchyma.

The amount of hepatic steatosis was estimated using CAP values.

SECTION

18FDG-PET image analysis and abdominal computed tomography

PARAGRAPH

Details of the PET imaging protocol have been described previously.19

Whole body PET-CT was conducted using either one of two combination PET-CT scanners: a Biograph TruePoint 40 (Siemens Medical Solutions, Hoffman Estates, IL, USA) or a Discovery 600 (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA).

After fasting for at least eight hours, participants' blood glucose levels were recorded prior to the 18FDG injection, which consisted of approximately 5.5 Bq of 18FDG per kilogram of body weight administered intravenously.

At 60 min after the injection, PET-CT scanning was performed from the skull base to the mid-thigh.

PET image acquisition followed CT scanning as follows: 2.5 min per bed position of 21.6 m in a three-dimensional acquisition mode (Biograph TruePoint 40) or 2 min per bed position of 15.7 m in a three-dimensional acquisition mode (Discovery 600).

The CT images were reconstructed using a 512 × 512 matrix, and were converted into 511 eV-equivalent attenuation factors for attenuation correction.

Reconstructed PET images were acquired using a 128 × 128 matrix with ordered subset expectation maximization and correction for attenuation.

PARAGRAPH

Experts in nuclear medicine, who were blinded to participants' clinical and laboratory data, calculated standardized uptake value (SUV) as follows: SUV = (decay-corrected activity [kBq] per ml of tissue volume)/(injected 18FDG activity [kBq]/body mass [g]).

We drew from multiple regions of interest (ROIs) to measure the SUVmax of the myocardium and the SUVmean of the liver, for a semi-quantitative analysis.

Two-dimensional ROIs were drawn through the transaxial images to measure the SUVmax of the left ventricular myocardium within an inner edge.

We excluded participants showing striking focal FDG uptake in the left ventricle, which could be caused by ischemic change.33

We also obtained SUV of the liver from the circular ROI along the periphery of the right lobe, 1 m from the margin.

In FDG-PET scanning for malignancy, the liver has been used as an internal standard to grade FDG uptake of whole body lesions, because SUV remains stable in the liver over time – even in patients with diffuse fatty liver disease – when measured as a mean in the right lobe.34,35

To mitigate variability, the heart SUV to the liver FDG uptake ratio (SUV Heart/SUV Liver) was used to estimate myocardial glucose uptake.35,36

PARAGRAPH

Abdominal adipose tissue was measured at the level of the L4 vertebra in a supine position by either a dual source 128 slice CT scanner (Somatom Definition Flash, Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany) or a 64 slice CT scanner (Somatom Sensation 64, Siemens Healthcare) with a slice thickness of 3 m, a tube voltage of 120 V, 150 effective mAs, 1.0 pitch, and a 0.5 s rotation time.

The fat area was identified using attenuation values between −190 and −30 Hounsfield units.

Total abdominal fat area (in cm2) was defined as a region with density ranging from −30 to −190 Hounsfield units using the Aquarius iNtuition Viewer software, version 4.4.11 (Terarecon, San Mateo, CA, USA), and the peritoneum was used as a boundary to distinguish visceral and subcutaneous fat.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

The characteristics of the study participants were analysed according to the status of NAFLD using Student’s t test for continuous variables and χ2 test for categorical variables.

All continuous variables were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation, and categorical variables were expressed as proportions.

E/e’ ratio, liver stiffness and myocardial glucose uptake were log-transformed due to skewed distribution.

High myocardial glucose uptake was defined as the highest quartile of SUV Heart/SUV Liver (>1.9).

Hepatic fibrosis was defined as the highest quartile values of LSM.

Myocardial glucose uptake, E/e’, LSM and CAP values were categorized as quartiles and Pearson’s χ2 test for linear-by-linear association was computed for trend analyses.

Multivariable linear regression analysis was applied to determine the independent association between E/e’ and the following parameters: hepatic steatosis (CAP and FLI), hepatic fibrosis (liver stiffness and NFS), myocardial glucose uptake and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT).

Age, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, GFR and total cholesterol were adjusted in Model 2, further adjusted for the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers in Model 3, further adjusted for diabetes status, use of metformin, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and insulin in Model 4, and further adjusted for BMI and visceral fat area (VFA) in Model 5.

A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0 for Windows (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY USA).

Results

SECTION

Participant characteristics

PARAGRAPH

Clinical, metabolic, and laboratory characteristics of the study participants (45% female) stratified by presence or absence of NAFLD, are illustrated in Table 1.

Of the study subjects, 118 (38%) had NAFLD.

The mean age was not significantly different, 56.9 ± 10.1 ears in subjects without NAFLD and 59.1 ± 10.1 ears in subjects with NAFLD.

NAFLD patients were more likely to be hypertensive (47% vs. 33%), obese (58% vs. 16%), and have diabetes (24% vs. 13%) compared to those without NAFLD (all p <0.05).

Measures of visceral and subcutaneous fat area, waist and hip circumferences, triglycerides and alanine aminotransferase were higher in subjects with NAFLD (all p <0.001).

SECTION

Echocardiographic characteristics of the study population (association of NAFLD with cardiac structural and functional alterations)

PARAGRAPH

When compared to those without NAFLD, patients with NAFLD demonstrated alterations in cardiac remodeling, manifested by increased LV mass and LV mass index, LV end-systolic and LV end-diastolic diameters, and LA volume index (all p <0.05 [Table 2]).

PARAGRAPH

Although LV systolic function reflected by LVEF was similar between the two groups, several echocardiographic parameters related to diastolic function were worse in NAFLD participants.

E velocity, E/A ratio, and septal tissue Doppler e’ velocity were significantly decreased, and E/e’ ratio was much higher in subjects with NAFLD (all p <0.05 [Fig. 1A]).

In addition, increased LV filling pressure was more likely to be observed in patients with NAFLD than those without NAFLD (Fig. 1B).

When the extent of liver steatosis assessed by CAP measurements and E/e’ ratio were stratified by quartiles, steatosis amount (CAP) showed a strong positive relationship with LV filling pressure (E/e’ ratio) (p for trend <0.05 [Fig. 1C]).

SECTION

Association of myocardial glucose uptakes with NAFLD and diastolic heart function

PARAGRAPH

Alteration in myocardial substrate metabolism, characterized by increased myocardial fatty acid metabolism and concurrently decreased glucose metabolism in individuals with insulin resistance, can be assessed by measuring myocardial glucose uptake with 18FDG-PET.

When compared to those without NAFLD, participants with NAFLD showed significant decreases in myocardial glucose uptake (No NAFLD, 1.72 vs. NAFLD, 1.20; p <0.001 [Fig. 2A]).

This finding arises from the difference in SUV values measured in myocardium (Fig. 2B), whereas liver SUV were comparable regardless of NAFLD status (Fig. 2C).

Furthermore, when the extent of liver steatosis assessed by CAP measurement and myocardial glucose uptake were stratified by quartiles, steatosis amount (CAP) showed a strong negative relationship with myocardial glucose uptake (p for trend <0.01 [Fig. 2D]).

PARAGRAPH

In addition, subjects without NAFLD were more likely to have higher myocardial glucose uptake compared to those with NAFLD (No NAFLD 35.3% vs. NAFLD 12.7%; p <0.001 [Fig. S1A]).

This relationship was supported by decreased CAP values (p = 0.001 [Fig. S1B]) seen in subjects with higher myocardial glucose uptake.

PARAGRAPH

When we assess the relationship between myocardial glucose uptake and diastolic heart function, E/e’ ratio (a measure of LV filling pressure) was significantly increased in subjects with lower myocardial glucose uptake (p <0.01 [Fig. 3A]) and a higher proportion of individuals with diastolic heart function was more likely to be observed in these subjects (p <0.01 [Fig. 3B]).

After myocardial glucose uptake and E/e’ ratio were stratified by quartiles, myocardial glucose uptake showed a strong inverse correlation with E/e’ ratio (p for trend <0.05 [Fig. 3C]).

SECTION

Association of hepatic fibrosis with myocardial glucose uptake and diastolic function

PARAGRAPH

Not only steatosis, but also fibrotic burden in the liver, were associated with myocardial glucose uptake and diastolic function.

Subjects with significant fibrosis demonstrated higher values of E/e’ ratio (significant fibrosis 10.7 vs. no significant fibrosis 9.6; p <0.01 [Fig. 4A]) and tended to have increased LV filling pressure (significant fibrosis 20.5% vs. no significant fibrosis 9.1%; p <0.01 [Fig. 4B]).

Hepatic fibrosis stratified by quartiles also showed a strong positive correlation with LV filling pressure (E/e’ ratio) (p for trend <0.05 [Fig. 4C]).

Furthermore, marginal decrease in myocardial glucose uptake was observed in individuals with significant fibrosis (no significant fibrosis 1.60 vs. significant fibrosis 1.31; p = 0.194 [Fig. 4D]), and subjects with lower myocardial glucose uptake had higher liver fibrotic burden (all p <0.05 [Fig. 2]).

SECTION

Multivariable regression analyses

PARAGRAPH

To evaluate whether diastolic heart dysfunction is independently associated with hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted to adjust for clinically important factors (Table 3).

The association between liver fibrosis and E/e’ ratio remained significant in Model 1 and 2 (standardized β = 0.15 to 0.27; all p <0.01) and persisted with slight attenuation in β value even after adjustment with anti-hypertensive agents, diabetes status and anti-diabetic agents (standardized β = 0.14 to 0.16; all p <0.005).

Inclusion of adiposity variables (BMI and VFA) in Model 5 further decreased β value, which was still significant (standardized β = 0.12; p = 0.024).

To exclude the potential impact of diabetes on these associations, we stratified the study population according to the presence of diabetes.

Regression analyses showed the consistent association between liver stiffness and E/e’ ratio in individuals with no diabetes (n = 255), but not in patients with diabetes (n = 53), probably because of small number of participants (Table S1).

PARAGRAPH

CAP values reflecting degree of hepatic steatosis were also significantly associated with E/e’ ratio after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, GFR, total cholesterol, diabetes and medication use for hypertension or diabetes (Model 1–4; standardized β = 0.10 to 0.15; all p <0.05).

However, this association disappeared when further adjusted for BMI and VFA in Model 5 (p = 0.646).

The degree of myocardial glucose uptake showed a significant relationship with E/e’ ratio in the linear regression models (Model 1–2; standardized β = −0.14 to −0.09; all p <0.05), although its association became non-significant with adjustment of medication use and diabetes (Model 3 and 4) or adiposity parameters (Model 5).

In addition, surrogate indices for hepatic steatosis (FLI) and fibrosis (NFS) also showed a similar pattern of associations with E/e’ ratio (Table S2), while association between GGT and E/e’ ratio did not reach statistical significance.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The present study demonstrated that both hepatic fibrosis and steatosis were significantly associated with diastolic heart dysfunction, reflected by increasing LV filling pressure and LA volume index in clinically non-cirrhotic subjects without heart disease.

In addition, myocardial glucose uptake examined by using 18FDG-PET was impaired in subjects with hepatic steatosis or fibrosis.

Consistent with previous studies, we also observed that individuals with lower myocardial glucose uptake were more likely to have alterations in diastolic heart function.

PARAGRAPH

Small pediatric studies have reported that NAFLD is related to myocardial insulin resistance, alteration in myocardial energy metabolism, and LV and diastolic dysfunction.12,13,37

However, these pathological (morbid) associations between the liver and heart were not sufficiently validated in the general adult population.

Although several studies showed that subjects with NAFLD were linked with LV structural abnormalities and diastolic dysfunction,14,38–42 its relationship with hepatic fibrosis was not investigated due to limitations in the use of ultrasonography or CT.

In contrast, our study participants were thoroughly examined, using liver elastography with CAP to quantify hepatic fibrosis and steatosis.

Based on these data, we have demonstrated a strong dose-dependent association between severity of hepatic steatosis and higher estimated LV filling pressures (reflected by E/e’ ratio) or myocardial glucose uptake.

PARAGRAPH

The present study also illustrated, for the first time, that subclinical hepatic fibrosis was significantly related to diastolic heart dysfunction in individuals without clinical heart failure.

As liver cirrhosis can progress to heart failure due to hemodynamic mechanisms,43 we excluded these patients based on ultrasonographic examination and clinical symptom evaluation.

A clear dose-dependent relationship was established between severity of hepatic fibrosis and diastolic heart function (E/e’ ratio).

Similarly, individuals with higher levels of serum gamma-glutamyltransferase, which is a potential indicator of underlying NASH, had increased risks of incident heart failure in several cohort studies.44,45

Moreover, linear regression analyses also showed that multiple clinical risk factors, such as diabetes and visceral adiposity, did not diminish their strong independent association.

Considering the recent finding that epicardial fat thickness increases commensurately with severity of liver fibrosis46 and the well-established notion that epicardial fat can affect heart dysfunction,47 we can assume that epicardial fat might be a possible mediator of the strong relationship between hepatic fibrosis and diastolic heart dysfunction.

Furthermore, NASH is associated with oxidative stress,48 chronic inflammation49 and myocardial lipotoxicity,50 which can induce alterations in cardiac geometry and function.

Oxidative stress can directly induce cellular apoptosis and trigger production of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6, which mediate inflammation and a fibrogenic response in the liver and heart causing functional alteration.

Activation of the systemic and local renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with subsequent production of excess reactive oxygen species plays a pivotal role in the progression of both hepatic fibrosis51 and diastolic dysfunction.52

Insulin resistance, which is a major causative factor of NASH, can also aggravate diastolic dysfunction via impairment of mitochondrial function and muscle protein degradation by the stimulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway.53,54

In addition, hepatokines might act as potential mediators for the development of diastolic dysfunction in NASH, as a previous study showed that fetuin-A, a well-known hepatokine elevated in patients with NAFLD,55 contributed to lipid-induced inflammation56 and closely linked to left ventricular dysfunction.57

PARAGRAPH

We previously reported that visceral adiposity as well as obesity were significantly associated with myocardial glucose uptake.

Our previous data confirmed that myocardial glucose uptake was affected by systemic insulin resistance in association with visceral adiposity and increased free fatty acids levels.19

Given these strong relationships, adjustment for BMI and VFA attenuated the power of the association between diastolic dysfunction and myocardial glucose uptake or hepatic steatosis in our regression models (Table 3).

Insulin resistance accompanied by elevated free fatty acids and hyperinsulinemia affects the capacity of glucose uptake in various peripheral tissues, including myocardium.

PARAGRAPH

Diastolic heart dysfunction is considered a clinically important predictor of mortality in individuals with preserved systolic function58 and its prevalence is currently increasing59 due to aging and epidemic obesity.

Among echocardiographic parameters, we found that not only E/e’ but also LA volume index was significantly increased in patients with hepatic steatosis (Table 2) and fibrosis (21.8 ± 5.8 l/m2 in no significant fibrosis vs. 23.8 ± 5.2 l/m2 in significant fibrosis; p = 0.002).

LA volume index is a reliable and powerful indicator of the severity of LV diastolic dysfunction60 and prognosis in several cardiometabolic diseases, including myocardial infarction,61 heart failure,62 and diabetes.63

Therefore, assessment of fibrosis progression in patients with NAFLD may be important for identifying those at high risk of future diastolic heart failure and for determining the optimal time to commence medical intervention.

PARAGRAPH

The current study had several distinguishing strengths.

This is the first study to consider the impact of both hepatic steatosis and fibrosis on diastolic heart dysfunction in relation to myocardial glucose uptake examined with 18FDG-PET in the general population.

Several crucial cardiometabolic parameters including subcutaneous and VFA, myocardial glucose uptake, heart structure, and systolic and diastolic function were thoroughly evaluated using standard methods.

Liver elastography with CAP was applied for quantification of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis.

Although liver biopsy is still considered the gold standard for detecting hepatic fibrosis, its invasiveness and high cost are major barriers in real clinical practice.

Furthermore, liver biopsy in assessing fibrosis can be inaccurate depending on inter-observer variability and on sampling error, especially for insufficient specimens.64,65

TE is a reliable, quick and non-invasive tool to identify hepatic fibrosis.

To date, evidence from both prospective and retrospective studies has been accumulated to support the accuracy of TE for detecting fibrosis in patients with NAFLD.66

PARAGRAPH

However, this study has some limitations, which may be addressed with further investigation.

First, the cross-sectional study design was insufficient to determine a causal relationship between hepatic fibrosis or steatosis and abnormalities in heart structures or function.

Second, lacking hepatic biopsies, we assessed hepatic fibrosis and steatosis using liver elastography with CAP, which is well validated and widely used in the hepatology research field.67,68

In addition, a major weakness of the present study is that myocardial glucose uptake was assessed by 18FDG-PET at fasted state, which cannot accurately estimate the myocardial insulin sensitivity.

Therefore, our findings have to be interpreted with caution, as myocardial insulin resistance should be measured at insulin-stimulated state, which needs to be investigated in future studies.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, the present study indicates that significant alterations in cardiac structure and function are evident in patients with hepatic fibrosis, as well as those with steatosis, in the absence of overt cardiovascular disease.

In addition, myocardial glucose uptake was significantly associated with diastolic heart dysfunction.

Prospective, well-designed, longitudinal studies with sufficient heart and liver imaging resources are warranted to elucidate this complex relationship between myocardial remodeling and NAFLD-related liver fibrosis.
