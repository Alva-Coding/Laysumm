TITLE

Dysregulation of serum bile acids and FGF19 in alcoholic hepatitis

PARAGRAPH

Understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive alcoholic hepatitis is important for the development of new biomarkers and targeted therapies.

Herein, we describe a molecule that is increased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

Modulating the molecular pathway of this molecule might lead to promising targets for the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis.
