TITLE

Metabolic pathway analyses identify proline biosynthesis pathway as a promoter of liver tumorigenesis

PARAGRAPH

Even with the recently approved immunotherapies against liver cancer, currently available medications show limited clinical benefits or efficacy in the majority of patients.

As such, it remains a top priority to discover new targets for effective liver cancer treatment.

Here, we identify a critical role for the proline biosynthetic pathway in liver cancer development, and demonstrate that targeting key proteins in the pathway, namely PYCR1 and ALDH18A1, may be a novel therapeutic strategy for liver cancer.
