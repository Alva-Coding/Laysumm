ABSTRACT

TITLE

Management of adverse events with tailored sorafenib dosing prolongs survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients

PARAGRAPH

Sorafenib is associated with multiple adverse events (AEs), potentially causing its permanent interruption.

It is unknown how physicians’ experience has impacted on the management of these AEs and consequently on clinical outcomes.

We aimed to assess whether AE management changed over time and if these modifications impacted on treatment duration and overall survival (OS).

PARAGRAPH

We analysed the prospectively collected data of 338 consecutive patients who started sorafenib between January 2008 and December 2017 in 3 tertiary care centres in Italy.

Patients were divided according to the starting date: Group A (2008–2012; n = 154), and Group B (2013–2017, n = 184).

Baseline and follow-up data were compared.

In the OS analysis, patients who received second-line treatments were censored when starting the new therapy.

PARAGRAPH

Baseline characteristics, AEs, and radiological response were consistent across groups.

Patients in Group B received a lower median daily dose (425 vs. 568 mg/day, p <0.001) due to more frequent dose modifications.

However, treatment duration was longer (5.8 vs. 4.1 months, p = 0.021) with a trend toward a higher cumulative dose in Group B. Notably, the OS was also higher (12.0 vs. 11.0 months, p = 0.003) with a sharp increase in the 2-year survival rate (28.1 vs. 18.4%, p = 0.003) in Group B. Multivariate time-dependent Cox regression analysis confirmed later period of treatment (2013–2017) as an independent predictor of survival (HR 0.728; 95% CI 0.581–0.937; p = 0.013).

Unconsidered confounders were unlikely to affect these results at the sensitivity analysis.

PARAGRAPH

Experience in the management of sorafenib-related AEs prolongs treatment duration and survival.

This factor should be considered in the design of future randomised clinical trials including a sorafenib treatment arm, as an underestimate of sample size may derive.
