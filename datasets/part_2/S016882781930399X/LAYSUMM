TITLE

Donor outcomes in anonymous live liver donation

PARAGRAPH

We report a unique experience with 50 living donors who volunteered to donate to a recipient with whom they had no biological connection or prior relationship (anonymous living donors).

This report is the first to discuss motivations, strategies and facilitators that may mitigate physical, social and ethical risk factors in this patient population.

With rigorous protocols, anonymous liver donation and recipient outcomes are excellent; with appropriate clinical expertise and system facilitators in place, our experience suggests that other centers may consider the procedure for its significant potential to reduce the gap between transplant organ demand and availability.
