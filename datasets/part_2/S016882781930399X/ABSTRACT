ABSTRACT

TITLE

Donor outcomes in anonymous live liver donation

PARAGRAPH

Death rates on liver transplant waiting lists range from 5%–25%.

Herein, we report a unique experience with 50 anonymous individuals who volunteered to address this gap by offering to donate part of their liver to a recipient with whom they had no biological connection or prior relationship, so called anonymous live liver donation (A-LLD).

PARAGRAPH

Candidates were screened to confirm excellent physical, mental, social, and financial health.

Demographics and surgical outcomes were analyzed.

Qualitative interviews after donation examined motivation and experiences.

Validated self-reported questionnaires assessed personality traits and psychological impact.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 50 A-LLD liver transplants were performed between 2005 and 2017.

Most donors had a university education, a middle-class income, and a history of prior altruism.

Half were women.

Median age was 38.5 years (range 20–59).

Thirty-three (70%) learned about this opportunity through public or social media.

Saving a life, helping others, generativity, and reciprocity for past generosity were motivators.

Social, financial, healthcare, and legal support in Canada were identified as facilitators.

A-LLD identified most with the personality traits of agreeableness and conscientiousness.

The median hospital stay was 6 days.

One donor experienced a Dindo-Clavien Grade 3 complication that completely resolved.

One-year recipient survival was 91% in 22 adults and 97% in 28 children.

No A-LLD reported regretting their decision.

PARAGRAPH

This is the first and only report of the characteristics, motivations and facilitators of A-LLD in a large cohort.

With rigorous protocols, outcomes are excellent.

A-LLD has significant potential to reduce the gap between transplant organ demand and availability.
