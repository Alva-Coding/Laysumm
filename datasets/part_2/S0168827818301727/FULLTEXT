TITLE

Newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with advanced hepatitis C treated with DAAs: A prospective population study

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been revolutionized by direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs).1,2

DAAs are safe and highly effective in eradicating HCV in patients with different stages of HCV infection, including decompensated cirrhosis.3–8

Indeed, evidence has been provided that DAAs enable more than 90% of patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Turcotte-Pugh [CTP]-A) and more than 80% of those with decompensated cirrhosis (CTP-B or -C) to achieve a sustained virological response (SVR).

Eradication of HCV has created great expectations in terms of clinical outcomes in these patients.

Indeed, SVR obtained by DAAs was found to be associated, on a short-term basis, with significant improvement of liver function, and of prognostic scores such as CTP and model for end-stage liver disease scores.7–11

In addition, a reduction in hospitalization and mortality has been observed in HCV cirrhotics achieving SVR with DAAs.12,13

In this exciting field, controversial data have been reported on the rate of development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients treated with DAAs.14–19

In the interferon era, the risk of developing HCC in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis, was reported to be equal to 2–3% yearly in those who were not treated, and reduced to 0.66% in those who achieved HCV eradication with IFN-based therapy.20–24

It was therefore surprising and at the same time alarming the report of “an unexpected high rate” of HCC early recurrence during or after DAAs in patients with a previous history of cured HCC.14

Since than, there have been several publications on this topic, reporting different rates of recurrence as well as of “de novo” occurrence in patients with HCV treated with DAAs.

More recently, a meta-analysis of 26 studies of interferon-based or DAA-based therapies, suggested that DAAs are not associated with increased risk of HCC occurrence.25

Accordingly, two recent large retrospective studies did not find any evidence that DAAs might favor development of HCC.26,27

Nevertheless, the issue is still debated, continuing to represent a reason of concern for treating physicians in the absence of large prospective studies.

The aim of this study was therefore to assess rate of newly diagnosed HCC and associated risk factors in a large prospective, population-based study of patients with HCV and advanced liver fibrosis treated with DAAs.

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Study design

PARAGRAPH

This study is based on the analysis of the Web-based platform “NAVIGATORE”, on which relevant data of all patients with HCV treated with DAAs in the Veneto region (Italy), are recorded prospectively.

All the 26 Clinical Centers authorized to prescribe DAAs by the Veneto Regional Governing Board are involved in the project.

The analysis described in this study relates to patients initiating DAA treatment from January 1st 2015 to September 1st 2017.

PARAGRAPH

The study is conducted according to the ethical guidelines of the 2013 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Local Ethics Committee.

SECTION

The “NAVIGATORE” database

PARAGRAPH

Individual data at baseline and during periodical follow-up are prospectively recorded on the NAVIGATORE platform, which is based on REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture: a secure, distributed, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies, providing an intuitive interface for validated data entry and audit trails for tracking data manipulation; http://project-redcap.org/).

PARAGRAPH

Baseline data include: Age, gender, body mass index, any associated disease and medication, any previous antiviral therapy for HCV, blood cell counts and hemoglobin levels, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and liver function tests, alpha-fetoprotein levels, HCV-RNA levels and genotype, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) results, staging of liver disease by invasive (liver biopsy) or non-invasive (aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio [APRI] score and FIBROSCAN) methods.

Follow-up data include: a) clinical assessment with liver function tests, ALT, AST and HCV-RNA measurements at monthly intervals during DAA treatment and at three and six months after end of therapy and b) long-term follow-up data with biannual clinical assessment and liver imaging surveillance by adequate ultrasound or computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging.

Patients developing any suspicious liver lesions by these techniques during or after therapy were further assessed with a complementary imaging method to confirm or exclude HCC according to the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) Guidelines on HCC.28

In addition, a guided liver biopsy was performed when indicated according to the EASL recommendations.

Thus, HCC diagnosis was established either by histological examination or by validated non-invasive imaging techniques.28

PARAGRAPH

Data entry in NAVIGATORE is optimized through periodic meetings, at quarterly frequency, to homogenize behaviors and to strengthen common goals.

In addition, the data quality is assured through interactive controls generating triggered alerts and queries.

SECTION

Patient selection

PARAGRAPH

The inclusion criterion was baseline fibrosis stage ≥F3 according to METAVIR classification29 as assessed by transient elastography or liver biopsy.

PARAGRAPH

Exclusion criteria were: a) CTP class C b) liver transplantation before the start of DAAs, c) history or presence of HCC before the start of DAAs, d) follow-up <4 weeks after the start of DAAs.

SECTION

Assessment of HCC at baseline

PARAGRAPH

All patients underwent a complete clinical and laboratory evaluation including an abdomen ultrasonography during the three months preceding the initiation of DAA therapy.

If a suspected focal lesion was identified in the liver, a full diagnostic work-up was completed with another complementary imaging technique and, when indicated by liver biopsy.28

Patients diagnosed with HCC were not eligible to initiate DAA therapy according to the national reimbursement rules.

SECTION

Antiviral therapy

PARAGRAPH

All patients received DAA treatment based on available DAAs and according to National and Regional guidelines.30,31

From January 2015 to the end of February 2015 patients were treated with the combination of sofosbuvir and ribavirin, and since the last week of February the combination of sofosbuvir plus simeprevir also became available for patients with HCV genotype 1 (HCV-1) or HCV genotype 4 (HCV-4).

In May 2015, sofosbuvir and ledipasvir, sofosbuvir and daclatasvir and then ombitasvir plus paritaprevir plus ritonavir and dasabuvir also became available.

Patients were treated for 12 or 24 weeks, with or without the addition of ribavirin, according to guidelines and medical decision.

The assigned schedule and any modifications during treatment were recorded on the NAVIGATORE platform.

Patients were seen monthly during therapy, and 12 and 24 weeks after termination of treatment and then at six-month intervals.

PARAGRAPH

SVR to therapy was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA by a quantitative real-time PCR with a limit of detection of 12 IU/ml and was assessed at week 12 after therapy (SVR12) and confirmed at week 24.

SECTION

Sample size

PARAGRAPH

Since our study is prospectively enrolling patients on a consecutive basis, we decided to estimate an adequate sample size to meet our primary objective, that was to compare the incidence of HCC in our DAA treated patients with the expected incidence in untreated patients.

Based on the historical findings of an annual incidence of HCC of 2.0–3.0% in untreated patients with HCV-related cirrhosis from our geographic region,22,23 a cohort size of about 4,000 was found to produce a two-sided 90% confidence interval with a width equal to 0.009 when the proportion to estimate is 0.028.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

We have evaluated development of HCC and estimated the incidence as cases per 100 patients-years, with its 95% confidence limits, for all patients and by stratifying for stage of liver disease and by baseline factors.

Their hazard ratios (HR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI), were estimated by univariate Cox’s regression.

Patients not developing HCC were censored at the last visit or at the date of death, including those who had prematurely discontinued DAA therapy.

PARAGRAPH

We have also developed a proportional hazards multivariate Cox model by entering the baseline factors that lead the criterion of p <0.10 in univariate Cox analysis, corrected for potential interaction.

PARAGRAPH

The Kaplan-Meier curves of the incidence of HCC were plotted for the three fibrosis strata (F3, CTP-A and CTP-B cirrhosis) and the statistical differences were tested by the Mantel-Cox method.

Another Kaplan-Meier plot was created to show the effect of the different combinations between factors entered into the Cox model.

For reporting activity and statistical analysis we used IBM-SPSS Statistics v23 (Chicago, IL, USA) and STATISTICA v12 (StatSoft Inc.

Tulsa, OK, USA).

Results

SECTION

Patients and baseline features

PARAGRAPH

From January 1st 2015 to September 1st 2017, 4,234 patients with F3 or with cirrhosis were entered in the database.

A total of 317 of them were excluded from further analysis, including: 11 patients with CTP-C, 111 patients with a previous HCC, 154 patients who had received a liver transplant before starting DAAs, and 41 patients with <4 weeks of follow-up after starting DAAs.

The baseline characteristics of the remaining 3,917 patients are described (Table 1).

Patients were predominantly males (62.2%) with a mean age of 58.1 ± 11.9 years and a range from 21 to 90 years.

The majority were infected with HCV-1 (61.8%), mainly with HCV genotype 1b (HCV-1b), and 41.6% were treatment-experienced.

Nine hundred and fifty-nine patients had F3 fibrosis according to the METAVIR classification, while 2,388 had CTP-A cirrhosis (CTP-A), and 352 CTP-B cirrhosis (CTP-B).

Regarding comorbidities: 11.2% had type 2 diabetes, 4.9% were obese and 15.8% had cardiovascular disease.

Coinfection with HIV and with hepatitis B virus (HBV) was present in 9.7% and in 1.3% of the cases, respectively.

Patients were treated with different DAA regimens, with or without ribavirin (Table 1).

SECTION

Follow-up and virological response

PARAGRAPH

At the time of this analysis, patients had a mean follow-up of 536.2 ± 197.6 days (median 523 days, IQR 381–699 days) after the start of DAAs.

SVR12 rate was 97.2% in F3 patients, 92.7% in patients with CTP-A cirrhosis and 80% in those with CTP-B cirrhosis.

SVR12 was observed in 92.9% of patients with genotype 1a, 95.1% of those with genotype 1b, in 92.4% of those with genotype 2, in 90.1% of those with genotype 3 and in 95% of those with genotype 4.

Therapy with DAAs was discontinued prematurely in 53 patients including: 21 patients who died (11 for liver-related causes and 10 for non-liver-related causes), four patients who developed HCC and 21 patients who developed drug-related severe side effects.

SECTION

Incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma

PARAGRAPH

During follow-up, 55 patients developed HCC, including 4/959 (0.42%) with F3 at baseline and 51/2,710 (1.88%) with cirrhosis at baseline.

The overall HCC incidence was of 0.97x100patients/year (95% CI 0.73–1.26).

The HCC incidence in the whole cohort of cirrhotic patients was 1.18% patients/year (95% CI 0.92–1.49).

When patients were stratified according to the stage of liver disease at baseline, HCC incidence rates during the first year of follow-up were 0.46x100patients/year (95% CI 0.12–1.17) in patients with fibrosis F3, 1.49x100patients/year (95% CI 1.03–2.08) in CTP-A cirrhosis and 3.61 × 100 patients/year (95% CI 1.86–6.31) in CTP-B cirrhosis.

The HCC incidence rate in the second year of follow-up declined to 0% in F3, to 0.20x100patients/year (95% CI 0.05–0.51) in CTP-A cirrhosis and to 0.69 × 100 patients/year (95% CI 0.08–2.49) in CTP-B cirrhosis and these differences were statistically significant (Mantel-Cox test, p = 0.00008).

The cumulative incidence of HCC in the three subgroups of patients (F3, cirrhosis CTP-A and cirrhosis CTP-B) by Kaplan–Meier curves is shown (Fig. 1).

SECTION

Risk factors for the development of HCC in cirrhotics treated with DAAs

PARAGRAPH

Several variables at baseline as well as the virological outcome (SVR) were investigated as potential risk factors for the development of HCC at univariate Cox regression analysis in cirrhotic patients (Table 2).

Stage of liver disease was associated with the risk of developing HCC (CTP-B vs. CTP-A; HR 2.55; 95% CI 1.36–4.78; p = 0.004) as well as stage of liver fibrosis by APRI ≥2.5 (HR 2.23; 95% CI 1.28–3.91; p = 0.005) but not by transient elastography.

PARAGRAPH

HBV coinfection was also significantly associated with HCC development (HR 3.93; p = 0.021) while HIV coinfection was not.

Among comorbidities, presence of diabetes was almost significant in its association with HCC development (HR 1.9; p = 0.059).

Conversely, patient’s age, gender, the HCV genotype and the type of DAA regimen received was not related to the risk of developing HCC.

PARAGRAPH

Finally, DAA treatment failure was strongly associated with development of HCC during/after treatment (HR 9.09; 95% CI 5.2–16.1; p = 0.0001).

PARAGRAPH

Multivariate analysis of baseline variables confirmed an APRI score value >2.5 (HR 2.03; 95% CI 1.14–3.61; p = 0.016) and HBV coinfection (HR 3.99; 95% CI 1.24–12.91; p = 0.021) as independent risk factors for HCC (Table 3).

The cumulative incidence of HCC derived by Cox’s modelling in relation to the presence of one or more risk factors is describe (Fig. 2), including APRI score value ≥2.5, CTP-B, HBV coinfection and diabetes.

SECTION

Timing and pattern of HCC occurrence during/after DAA

PARAGRAPH

The individual data of 55 patients who developed HCC are reported (Table S1).

They included 37 male and 18 female patients with a mean age of 59,15 ± 9.7 years (range 40 to 82 years) All major HCV genotypes were represented (6 HCV-1a 10.9%, 25 HCV-1b 45.4%, 6 HCV-2 10.9%, 13 HCV-3 23.6%, 5 HCV-4 9.0%).

SVR12 was obtained in 33 patients while the remaining 22 either interrupted treatment prematurely or did not achieved SVR12.

Time from initiation of DAAs and HCC diagnosis ranged from 4 to 75 weeks (mean 31.8 ± 20.1 weeks).

Twenty-two patients developed HCC while being treated with DAAs, while in the remaining 33 the tumor was diagnosed after the end of treatment.

PARAGRAPH

When the pattern of HCC in the 55 patients was considered, 30 patients (54.5%) presented with a single HCC lesion, and nine (16.3%) with 2–3 small HCC nodules <3 cm in diameter.

A more aggressive type of tumor was seen in the remaining 16 patients (29.1%) with multiple nodules of variable size (eight cases: 14.5%) or an infiltrative diffuse HCC (eight cases: 14.5%) with portal thrombosis in six (10.9%) and extrahepatic metastasis in four (7.2%).

PARAGRAPH

The frequency of these different HCC patterns in relation to virological outcome is reported (Fig. 3).

The more aggressive pattern of HCC was seen more frequently (54.6%) in patients without SVR compared to those with SVR (12.1%) in which the single nodule pattern prevailed (69.7%).

PARAGRAPH

The distribution of different patterns of HCC in relation to timing after initiation of DAA is reported (Fig. 4).

The more aggressive pattern prevailed in the early period of observation and often occurred during therapy, while the single HCC nodular pattern was predominant at longer follow-up.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The risk of developing HCC during and after DAA therapy in patients with HCV and advanced liver disease has recently been at the center of a vibrant and controversial debate, after the observation by Reig et al. of an “unexpected” high rate of HCC recurrence in HCV patients treated with DAAs after their original HCC had been successfully cured.14

Afterwards, several studies have not put an end to the debate since they have produced controversial results for both the incidence of HCC after DAA therapy (reporting different data on HCC occurrence from 6.6% to 1.79%) and the relationship between the occurrence of HCC and response to DAAs.14–19,25,27

The main limitation of most of these studies lies in both their retrospective nature and the heterogeneity of the patients included.

Our study has been conducted prospectively on a population basis in a large consecutive series of patients with HCV and advanced liver disease treated with various DAA regimens.

It provides evidence that in these patients the risk of developing HCC during the first year after initiation of DAAs is similar, or even reduced, compared to that expected without antiviral therapy, main risk factors being the same as previously described in the natural history of HCV-related cirrhosis, i.e. the stage of disease, HBV coinfection and type 2 diabetes.32

Indeed, in CTP-A cirrhotic patients treated with DAAs, the incidence of HCC (1.00 × 100 patients/year) was lower than observed in two historical cohorts of untreated patients from the same geographic region (2.8% and 3.9% patients/year).22,23

Likewise, in CTP-B cirrhotics, the incidence of HCC after DAAs was lower than that observed in an historical untreated cohort followed-up in our institution between 2006 and 2013 (2.40 vs. 6.4 patients/year, respectively) (unpublished data, shown in Table S2).

Our results clearly indicate that the risk of developing HCC is higher during the first year after initiation of antiviral therapy and declines significantly thereafter.

A striking difference in our study was in the risk of HCC in relation to the response to antiviral therapy.

Although development of an HCC was also observed in several patients with SVR, the tumor incidence was significantly higher in patients without HCV eradication.

Considering that most of our patients developed HCC early in the course of antiviral therapy, a relation of cause and effect between HCC and virological failure rather than the opposite appears more likely.

Other studies have reported higher rates of HCC development in patients without SVR compared to those achieving SVR.11,26,27

In a recent study the presence of an active HCC before the start of DAAs has been reported to be a negative predictor of SVR.33

The biological explanation for the lower rate of SVR in patients developing HCC is not entirely clear.

Nevertheless, it might be that HCC cells serve as a viral reservoir for HCV less permissive to DAAs, with the consequent relapse of HCV infection after antiviral therapy.

On these bases, our patients who did not reach SVR and developed HCC could already have microscopic, undetectable foci of HCC before initiation of DAAs.

In a subgroup of these patients, growth and spread of HCC could even be boosted by the profound immunological and molecular changes that are known to occur in the liver microenvironment following the abrupt reduction of HCV replication by DAAs,34–39 thus explaining the development of an aggressive tumor in some of them,40 although we cannot exclude that what we observed in these patients merely reflects the natural history of their liver disease.

Presence of HCC at baseline was in our study entrusted to an imaging test that could be dated up to three months before initiation of antiviral therapy.

So we may hypothesize that an adequate imaging assessment just before the start of DAAs could be important to exclude an active HCC, particularly in patients at higher risk, and DAAs should not be started before the nature of any hepatic focal lesions has been properly defined.

In addition, patients should continue to be closely monitored with adequate liver imaging during and after therapy independently of the virological outcome.

We suggest performing an imaging assessment every three months during and after therapy in patients with decompensated liver disease and in those with significant cofactors such as HBV coinfection or diabetes, and every six months for all other patients with advanced liver disease.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, our study provides solid evidence that treating patients with HCV and advanced liver disease with DAAs does not increase their risk of developing HCC.

In these patients the residual HCC risk appears dependent on variables well known to affect HCC development in untreated patients, such as stage of liver disease and comorbidities such as HBV and diabetes, being higher in patients without virological response and decreasing progressively over time in patients with SVR.

Further follow-up of our cohort, currently ongoing, will clarify whether the HCC risk could become insignificant at any time in any patient subgroup.
