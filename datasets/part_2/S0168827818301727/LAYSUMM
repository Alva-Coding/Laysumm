TITLE

Newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with advanced hepatitis C treated with DAAs: A prospective population study

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the complications of hepatitis C related cirrhosis.

Treating patients with advanced hepatitis C with the new interferonï¿½free direct-acting antiviral agents has been associated with improvement in liver function and survival, while more conflicting data have been reported regarding the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.

We report the results of a prospective population study on the incidence of newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with advanced hepatitis C treated with direct-acting antiviral agents, clearly indicating that the residual hepatocellular carcinoma risk is reduced and declines progressively with time after a sustained virological response.

Development of a liver tumor during/after therapy was associated with known risk factors and with virological failure.
