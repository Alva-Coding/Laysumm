TITLE

Liver-directed gene therapy results in long-term correction of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 in mice

PARAGRAPH

Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3) is a severe genetic liver disease that results from impaired transport of lipids to bile, which makes the bile toxic to liver cells.

Because therapeutic options are currently limited, this study aims to evaluate gene therapy to correct the underlying genetic defect in a mouse model of this disease.

By introducing a functional copy of the missing gene in liver cells of mice, we were able to restore lipid transport to bile and strongly reduce damage to the liver.

The proliferation of liver cells was also reduced, which contributes to long-term correction of the phenotype.

Further studies are required to evaluate whether this approach can be applied to patients with PFIC3.
