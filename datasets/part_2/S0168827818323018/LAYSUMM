TITLE

Immune and metabolic shifts during neonatal development reprogram liver identity and function

PARAGRAPH

Newborns face major challenges in the extra-uterine life.

In fact, organs need to modify their cellular composition and gene expression profile in order to adapt to changes in both microbiota and diet throughout life.

The liver is interposed between the gastrointestinal system and the systemic circulation, being the destination of all macronutrients and microbial products from the gut.

Therefore, it is expected that delicately balanced mechanisms govern the transformation of a neonatal liver to a key organ in adults.
