TITLE

Low subcutaneous adiposity associates with higher mortality in female patients with cirrhosis

PARAGRAPH

We looked at the importance of two of the main body compartments, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue (fat) on the prognosis of males and females with end-stage liver disease.

Lower amounts of subcutaneous fat but not visceral fat (around internal organs), are associated with higher mortality in female patients with end-stage liver disease.

However, low skeletal muscle predicts mortality in male patients with end-stage liver disease.
