ABSTRACT

TITLE

A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of emricasan in patients with NASH and F1-F3 fibrosis

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by hepatocyte steatosis, ballooning, and lobular inflammation which may lead to fibrosis.

Lipotoxicity activates caspases, which cause apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine (IL-1Î² and IL-18) production.

Emricasan is a pan-caspase inhibitor that decreases serum aminotransferases and caspase activation in NASH patients.

This study postulated that 72 weeks of emricasan treatment would improve liver fibrosis without worsening of NASH.

PARAGRAPH

This double-blind, placebo-controlled study randomized 318 subjects 1:1:1 to twice-daily treatment with emricasan (5 or 50 mg) or matching placebo for 72 weeks.

Subjects had definite NASH and NASH CRN fibrosis stage F1-F3, as determined by a central reader, on a liver biopsy obtained within 6 months of randomization.

PARAGRAPH

Emricasan treatment did not achieve the primary objective of fibrosis improvement without worsening of NASH (emricasan 5 mg: 11.2%; emricasan 50 mg: 12.3%; placebo: 19.0%; odds ratios vs. placebo 0.530 and 0.588, with p=0.972 and 0.972, respectively) or the secondary objective of NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis (emricasan 5 mg: 3.7%; emricasan 50 mg: 6.6%; placebo: 10.5%; odds ratios vs. placebo 0.334 and 0.613, with p=0.070 and 0.335, respectively).

In the small subset of subjects with consistent normalization of serum ALT over 72 weeks, emricasan may have improved histologic outcomes.

PARAGRAPH

Emricasan treatment did not improve liver histology in subjects with NASH fibrosis despite target engagement and may have worsened fibrosis and ballooning.

Caspase inhibition lowered serum ALT in the short-term but may have directed cells to alternative mechanisms of cell death, resulting in more liver fibrosis and hepatocyte ballooning.
