ABSTRACT

TITLE

The WHO guidelines for chronic hepatitis B fail to detect half of the patients in need of treatment in Ethiopia

PARAGRAPH

In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued guidelines for the management of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in low- and middle-income countries, but little is known about the applicability of the WHO treatment criteria in sub-Saharan Africa.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the WHO guidelines in a large CHB cohort in Ethiopia.

PARAGRAPH

Treatment-naïve adults who attended a public CHB clinic in Addis Ababa were included in this analysis.

All patients underwent a standardized evaluation at recruitment, including blood tests and transient elastography (Fibroscan®).

A Fibroscan result >7.9 kPa was used to define significant fibrosis and >9.9 kPa to define cirrhosis.

Treatment eligibility was assessed using the most recent guidelines from the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) as the ‘gold standard’.

PARAGRAPH

Out of 1,190 patients with CHB, 300 (25.2%) were eligible for treatment based on the EASL 2017 guidelines and 182 (15.3%) based on the WHO 2015 guidelines.

The sensitivity and specificity of the WHO criteria were 49.0 and 96.1%, respectively.

Most patients (94 of 182; 51.6%) who fulfilled the WHO criteria had decompensated cirrhosis and might have a dismal prognosis even with therapy.

Only 41 of 115 patients (35.7%) with compensated cirrhosis, who are likely to benefit the most from therapy, were eligible for treatment based on the WHO criteria.

PARAGRAPH

The WHO guidelines for CHB failed to detect half of the patients in need of treatment in Ethiopia, implying the need for a revision of the WHO treatment criteria.
