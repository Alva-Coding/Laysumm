TITLE

The WHO guidelines for chronic hepatitis B fail to detect half of the patients in need of treatment in Ethiopia

PARAGRAPH

Antiviral therapy prevents disease progression and death in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), but the identification of patients in need of treatment is a challenge in low- and middle-income countries.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested treatment eligibility criteria for use in such settings, but in our study the WHO criteria detected less than half of those in need of therapy in a large Ethiopian cohort of 1,190 patients with CHB.

Our findings suggest that the WHO criteria might be unsuitable in sub-Saharan Africa.
