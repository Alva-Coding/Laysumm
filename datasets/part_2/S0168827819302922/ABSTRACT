ABSTRACT

TITLE

Contributing factors and outcomes of burn-associated cholestasis

PARAGRAPH

Cholestasis often occurs after burn injuries.

However, the prevalence of cholestasis and its effect on outcomes in patients with severe burn injuries are unknown.

The aim of this study was to describe the course and the burden of cholestasis in a cohort of severely burned adult patients.

PARAGRAPH

We investigated the relationship between burn-associated cholestasis (BAC) and clinical outcomes in a retrospective cohort of patients admitted to our unit for severe burn injuries between 2012 and 2015.

BAC was defined as an increased level of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≥1.5x the upper limit of normal (ULN) with an increased level of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) ≥3x ULN, or as an increased level of total bilirubin ≥2x ULN.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 214 patients were included: 111 (52%) patients developed BAC after a median (IQR) stay of 9 (5–16) days.

At 90 days, the mortality rate was 20%, including 34 and 9 patients with and without BAC (p <0.001), respectively, which corresponded to a 2.5-fold higher (95% CI 1.2–5.2, p = 0.012) risk of 90-day mortality for patients with BAC.

After being adjusted for severity of illness, patients with BAC, hyperbilirubinemia and without elevated ALP and GGT levels had a hazard ratio of 4.51 (95% CI 1.87–10.87) for 90-day mortality.

BAC was associated with the severity of the burn injury, shock and bacteraemia.

BAC was present in 38 (51%) patients at discharge, and 7 (18%) patients had secondary sclerosing cholangitis.

These patients maintained elevated levels of ALP and GGT that were 5.8x (1.7–15) the ULN and 11x the ULN (4.5–22), respectively, 20 months (3.5–35) after discharge.

PARAGRAPH

BAC is prevalent among patients with severe burn injuries and is associated with worse short-term outcomes, especially when total bilirubin levels were increased without elevated ALP and GGT levels.

BAC survivors are at risk of developing sclerosing cholangitis.
