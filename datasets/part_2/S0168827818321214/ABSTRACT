ABSTRACT

TITLE

Modeling NAFLD disease burden in China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, United Kingdom, and United States for the period 2016–2030

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are increasingly a cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma globally.

This burden is expected to increase as epidemics of obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome continue to grow.

The goal of this analysis was to use a Markov model to forecast NAFLD disease burden using currently available data.

PARAGRAPH

A model was used to estimate NAFLD and NASH disease progression in eight countries based on data for adult prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).

Published estimates and expert consensus were used to build and validate the model projections.

PARAGRAPH

If obesity and DM level off in the future, we project a modest growth in total NAFLD cases (0–30%), between 2016–2030, with the highest growth in China as a result of urbanization and the lowest growth in Japan as a result of a shrinking population.

However, at the same time, NASH prevalence will increase 15–56%, while liver mortality and advanced liver disease will more than double as a result of an aging/increasing population.

PARAGRAPH

NAFLD and NASH represent a large and growing public health problem and efforts to understand this epidemic and to mitigate the disease burden are needed.

If obesity and DM continue to increase at current and historical rates, both NAFLD and NASH prevalence are expected to increase.

Since both are reversible, public health campaigns to increase awareness and diagnosis, and to promote diet and exercise can help manage the growth in future disease burden.
