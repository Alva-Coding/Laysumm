TITLE

Modeling NAFLD disease burden in China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, United Kingdom, and United States for the period 2016â€“2030

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis can lead to advanced liver disease.

Both conditions are becoming increasingly prevalent as the epidemics of obesity and diabetes continue to increase.

A mathematical model was built to understand how the disease burden associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis will change over time.

Results suggest increasing cases of advanced liver disease and liver-related mortality in the coming years.
