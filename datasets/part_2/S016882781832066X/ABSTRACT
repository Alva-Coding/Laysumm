ABSTRACT

TITLE

The P2X4 purinergic receptor regulates hepatic myofibroblast activation during liver fibrogenesis

PARAGRAPH

Liver fibrosis is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular matrix produced by hepatic myofibroblasts (hMF), the activation of which is critical to the fibrogenic process.

Extracellular ATP, released by dying or stressed cells, and its purinergic receptors, constitute a powerful signaling network after injury.

Although the purinergic receptor P2X4 (P2RX4) is highly expressed in the liver, its functions in hMF had never been investigated during liver fibrogenesis.

PARAGRAPH

In vivo, bile duct ligation was performed and methionine- and choline-deficient diet administered in wild-type and P2x4 knock-out (P2x4-KO) mice.

In vitro, hMF were isolated from mouse (wild-type and P2x4-KO) and human liver.

P2X4 pharmacological inhibition (in vitro and in vivo) and P2X4 siRNAs (in vitro) were used.

Histological, biochemical and cell culture analysis allowed us to study P2X4 expression and its involvement in the regulation of fibrogenic and fibrolytic factors, as well as of hMF activation markers and properties.

PARAGRAPH

P2X4 genetic invalidation or pharmacological inhibition protected mice from liver fibrosis and hMF accumulation after bile duct ligation or methionine- and choline-deficient diet.

Human and mouse hMFs expressed P2X4, mainly in lysosomes.

Invalidation of P2X4 in human and mouse hMFs blunted their activation marker expression and their fibrogenic properties.

Finally, we showed that P2X4 regulates calcium entry and lysosomal exocytosis in hMF, impacting on ATP release, profibrogenic secretory profile, and transcription factor activation.

PARAGRAPH

P2X4 expression and activation is critical for hMF to sustain their activated and fibrogenic phenotype.

Therefore, the inactivation of P2X4 may be of therapeutic interest during liver fibrotic diseases.
