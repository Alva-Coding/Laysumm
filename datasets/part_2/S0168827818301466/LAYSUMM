TITLE

Gut microbiota mediates diurnal variation of acetaminophen induced acute liver injury in mice

PARAGRAPH

Acetaminophen (APAP) induced acute liver failure because of over dose is a leading public health problem.

APAP-induced liver injury exhibits diurnal variation, specifically APAP causes more severe liver damage when taken at night compared with in the morning.

Herein, we showed that gut microbial metabolite, 1-phenyl-1,2-propanedione is involved in the rhythmic hepatotoxicity induced by APAP, by depleting hepatic glutathione (an important antioxidant) levels.

Our data suggest gut microbiota may be a potential target for reducing APAP-induced acute liver injury.
