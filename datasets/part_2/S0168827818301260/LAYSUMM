TITLE

Inhibition of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 facilitates liver repair after hepatic injury in mice

PARAGRAPH

Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury is a serious complication that occurs in liver surgery.

Herein, we demonstrated that inducible prostaglandin E2 synthase (mPGES-1), an enzyme involved in synthesizing prostaglandin E2, worsens the injury and delays liver repair through accumulation of proinflammatory macrophages.

Inhibition of mPGES-1 offers a potential therapy for both liver protection and repair in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury.
