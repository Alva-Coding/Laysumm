TITLE

Reactive cholangiocytes differentiate into proliferative hepatocytes with efficient DNA repair in mice with chronic liver injury

PARAGRAPH

During chronic liver disease, while native hepatocytes are exhausted and genetically unstable, a subset of cholangiocytes clonally expand to differentiate into young, functional and robust hepatocytes.

This cholangiocyte cell population is a promising target for regenerative therapies in patients with chronic liver insufficiency.
