ABSTRACT

TITLE

Prolactin improves hepatic steatosis via CD36 pathway

PARAGRAPH

Prolactin (PRL) is a multifunctional polypeptide with effects on metabolism, however, little is known about its effect on hepatic steatosis and lipid metabolism.

Herein, we aimed to assess the role of PRL in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

PARAGRAPH

The serum PRL levels of 456 patients with NAFLD, 403 controls without NAFLD diagnosed by ultrasound, and 85 individuals with liver histology obtained during metabolic surgery (44 female and 30 male patients with NAFLD and 11 age-matched non-NAFLD female individuals) were evaluated.

The expression of the gene encoding the prolactin receptor (PRLR) and signalling molecules involved in hepatic lipid metabolism were evaluated in human liver and HepG2 cells.

The effects of overexpression of PRLR or fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36 or knockdown of PRLR on hepatic lipid metabolism were tested in free fatty acid (FFA)-treated HepG2 cells.

PARAGRAPH

Circulating PRL levels were lower in individuals with ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD (men: 7.9 [range, 5.9–10.3] µg/L; women: 8.7 [range, 6.1–12.4] µg/L) than those with non-NAFLD (men: 9.1 [range, 6.8–13.0] µg/L, p = 0.002; women: 11.6 [range, 8.2–16.1] µg/L, p <0.001).

PRL levels in patients with biopsy-proven severe hepatic steatosis were lower compared with those with mild-to-moderate hepatic steatosis in both men (8.3 [range, 5.4–9.5] µg/L vs. 9.7 [range, 7.1–12.3] µg/L, p = 0.031) and women (8.5 [range, 4.2–10.6] µg/L vs. 9.8 [range, 8.2–15.7] µg/L, p = 0.027).

Furthermore, hepatic PRLR gene expression was significantly reduced in patients with NAFLD and negatively correlated with CD36 gene expression.

In FFA-induced HepG2 cells, PRL treatment or PRLR overexpression significantly reduced the expression of CD36 and lipid content, effects that were abrogated after silencing of PRLR.

Furthermore, overexpression of CD36 significantly reduced the PRL-mediated improvement in lipid content.

PARAGRAPH

Our results reveal a novel association between the central nervous system and the liver, whereby PRL/PRLR improved hepatic lipid accumulation via the CD36 pathway.
