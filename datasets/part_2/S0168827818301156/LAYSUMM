TITLE

Prolactin improves hepatic steatosis via CD36 pathway

PARAGRAPH

Our clinical study suggests a negative association between prolactin (PRL)/prolactin receptor (PRLR) and the presence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Using cell experiments, we found that PRL ameliorates hepatic steatosis via the hepatic PRLR and fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, a key transporter of free fatty acid uptake in liver.

Our findings suggest a novel approach to improving NAFLD using PRL and PRLR
