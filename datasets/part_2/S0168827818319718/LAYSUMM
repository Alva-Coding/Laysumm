TITLE

Long noncoding RNA lncHand2 promotes liver repopulation via c-Met signaling

PARAGRAPH

Long noncoding RNAs play important roles in various biological processes.

While long noncoding RNAs do not directly code proteins, they can regulate gene expression by diverse mechanisms.

We identified the long noncoding RNA, termed lncHand2 because of its proximity to the gene Hand2, to be an important determinant of liver regeneration through c-Met signaling.
