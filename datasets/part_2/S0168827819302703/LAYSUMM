TITLE

Chronic hepatitis delta virus infection leads to functional impairment and severe loss of MAIT cells

PARAGRAPH

Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection is the most severe form of viral hepatitis.

We found that in patients with HDV, a subset of innate-like T cells called mucosa-associated invariant T cells (or MAIT cells), which are normally abundant in peripheral blood and the liver, are activated, functionally impaired and severely depleted.
