TITLE

Prevalence, features and predictive factors of liver nodules in Fontan surgery patients: The VALDIG Fonliver prospective cohort

PARAGRAPH

Fontan surgery is the standard of care for many patients with univentricular congenital cardiopathies.

Recent advances have improved the survival of Fontan patients, and nowadays most of them reach adulthood.

In this setting, Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD) is increasingly recognised, and has become a significant prognostic factor.

Liver nodules are considered a component of FALD yet their prevalence, imaging features and predictors have hardly been evaluated.

In this study, we observed that liver nodules are frequent, typically hyperechoic, hypervascular and predominantly peripheral in patients with FALD.

This population is at risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, the diagnosis of which must be confirmed by biopsy.
