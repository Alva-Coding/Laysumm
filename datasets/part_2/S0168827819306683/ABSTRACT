ABSTRACT

TITLE

Prevalence, features and predictive factors of liver nodules in Fontan surgery patients: The VALDIG Fonliver prospective cohort

PARAGRAPH

Fontan surgery is used to treat a variety of congenital heart malformations, and may lead to advanced chronic liver disease in the long-term.

This study examines the prevalence, characteristics and predictors of liver nodules in patients with Fontan surgery.

PARAGRAPH

This was a prospective, cross-sectional and observational study conducted at eight European centres.

Consecutive patients with Fontan surgery underwent blood tests, abdominal ultrasonography (US), transient elastography (Fibroscan®), echocardiography, hemodynamics, and abdominal MRI/CT scan.

The primary outcome measure was liver nodules detected in the MRI/CT scan.

Predictors of liver nodules were identified by multivariate logistic regression.

PARAGRAPH

One hundred and fifty-two patients were enrolled (mean age 27.3 years).

The mean time elapsed from surgery to inclusion was 18.3 years.

Liver nodule prevalences were 29.6% (95% CI: 23–37%) on US and 47.7% (95% CI: 39-56%) on MRI/CT.

Nodules were usually hyperechoic (76.5%), round-shaped (>80%), hyperenhancing in the arterial phase (92%) and located in the liver periphery (75%).

The sensitivity and specificity of US were 50% (95% CI: 38-62%) and 85.3% (95% CI: 75-92%), respectively.

Inter-imaging test agreement was low (adjusted kappa: 0.34).

In the multivariate analysis, time since surgery > 10 years was the single independent predictor of liver nodules (OR: 4.18, P=0.040).

Hepatocellular carcinoma was histologically diagnosed in 2 of the 8 patients with hypervascular and washout liver nodules.

PARAGRAPH

While liver nodules are frequent in Fontan patients, they may go unnoticed in US.

Liver nodules are usually hyperechoic, hypervascular and predominantly peripheral.

This population is at risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, the diagnosis of which requires biopsy confirmation.
