TITLE

Prevalence, features and predictive factors of liver nodules in Fontan surgery patients: The VALDIG Fonliver prospective cohort

SECTION

INTRODUCTION

PARAGRAPH

Fontan surgery (FS) is the standard of care for many patients with congenital cardiopathies characterised by a functionally univentricular heart.

The common feature of these cardiac defects is the mixing of desaturated blood from the caval veins and oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins in a single ventricular pump.

Fontan circulation is a palliative strategy that aims to restore a double circulation system to avoid cyanosis.

Improvements in surgical techniques and medical management have had a significant impact on survival, and nowadays most Fontan patients survive into adulthood [1,2].

However, systemic venous congestion and reduced systemic cardiac output are the hallmarks of FS, leading to long-term multiorgan complications [3,4].

Further, this single haemodynamic system in Fontan patients puts the liver at risk of vascular damage and advanced chronic liver disease.

PARAGRAPH

Studies have shown that Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD) is an independent prognostic factor with a significant impact on survival [5].

Several retrospective single-centre studies with a limited sample size have also suggested that regenerative and hypervascular nodules on arterial phase imaging are frequent in this population [5–8].

As for other vascular liver diseases such as Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS), the diagnosis of liver nodules (LN) in FALD is a significant challenge, since features and risk factors for their presence are poorly documented.

Besides, the findings of several recent small case series have raised concerns about the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in Fontan patients [9–11].

The American College of Cardiology statement on FALD underlines the need for periodic radiologic liver assessment, although evidence-supported recommendations are lacking [12].

PARAGRAPH

To our knowledge, the present study is the first prospective multicentre investigation designed to assess the prevalence, characteristics, and predictor factors of LN on cross-sectional imaging.

As secondary objectives, we also addressed the diagnostic accuracy of abdominal ultrasonography (US) and inter-test agreement between US and MRI/CT in the Fontan population.

SECTION

MATERIAL AND METHODS

SECTION

Study design

PARAGRAPH

This was an observational, prospective, cross-sectional study conducted at eight European tertiary centres belonging to the VALDIG group (ww.valdig.eu).

All consecutive patients with FS were invited to participate in the study.

No exclusion criteria were applied.

The study period was December 2015 to October 2018.

The study protocol adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committees for Clinical Research of all the participating institutions (IRB code: 384/14, HRC-FONLIVER).

Written Informed consent for inclusion in the study was obtained in all cases.

SECTION

Procedures and variables

PARAGRAPH

A common standardized protocol was elaborated for the assessment of FALD before the study outset.

Patients were subjected to a structured medical interview, physical examination, blood tests to rule out other liver disease etiologies, abdominal US, liver elastography (Fibroscan®, Probe M/XL Echosens®, Paris France), abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) when MRI was contraindicated, and echocardiography.

Biopsy was considered by the multidisciplinary team in charge in patients with LN highly suspicious for malignancy as defined by i) arterial hyperenhancement and washout, ii) arterial hyperenhancement and enhancing capsule, iii) arterial hyperenhancement and > 20 mm, iv) hypo/iso-enhancement and >20 mm/enhancing capsule/washout.

Due to the observational design of the study, a haemodynamic evaluation was performed only when clinically indicated as deemed by the multidisciplinary team in charge.

In every patient, all laboratory and imaging studies were performed within 6 months of inclusion in the study.

SECTION

Baseline characteristics and blood tests

PARAGRAPH

The demographic (age and sex) and clinical data compiled were: type of congenital heart defect, FS surgical technique [atriopulmonary, lateral tunnel or extracardiac], New York Heart Association functional classification (NYHA), time since FS, height, weight, body mass index, alcohol abuse defined as >20 g/day in women and >30 g/day in men, and blood pressure.

The following laboratory parameters were assessed: serum creatinine, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, C-reactive protein, brain natriuretic peptide, serology (Ig HAV, HBV, HCV, and HIV), ferritin, transferrin, serum copper, ceruloplasmin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-fetoprotein, albumin, immunoglobulins, total serum proteins, haemogram, and international normalised ratio.

SECTION

Abdominal ultrasonography and liver elastography

PARAGRAPH

Fasting for at least 8 hours was required for both procedures.

US was performed by a radiologist or a hepatologist with expertise in abdominal imaging (>10,000 abdominal US).

The following variables were assessed: a nodular liver surface appearance, parenchymal echogenicity (homogeneous or heterogeneous), right hepatic lobe size in the longitudinal axis, central suprahepatic vein diameter, long spleen axis, ascites (absence, minimal or moderate-severe), presence of gallstones, and number and characteristics of LN.

These characteristics included their size (defined as the longest cross-sectional diameter), echogenicity (hypoechoic, isoechoic, or hyperechoic), shape (round, ellipsoidal or irregular with unclear margins) and peripheral location (outer margins within 2 cm of the liver border).

PARAGRAPH

Liver elastography (Fibroscan®) was carried out by a trained operator (>1,000 procedures) blinded to patient clinical history.

In all cases, at least ten measurements were obtained.

Only when there were more than ten valid measurements and an interquartile range < 30 were considered valid.

The final result was drawn from an average value expressed in kilopascals (kPa).

SECTION

Abdominal MRI and CT scan

PARAGRAPH

MRI and CT protocols are provided in Supplementary material.

The following characteristics of the nodules were systematically assessed: size (defined as the longest cross-sectional diameter), peripheral location using the definition described above, arterial phase enhancement, shape (round, ellipsoidal or irregular), washout in the portal venous phase defined as hypointensity or hypodensity in part of, or in the whole lesion, on the portal venous and/or delayed phase compared to the surrounding liver parenchyma.

We prospectively explored the behaviour of MRI/CT LI-RADS classification version 2014 [13].

Histological diagnosis of all biopsied nodules was recorded.

SECTION

Cardiovascular assessment

PARAGRAPH

Left ventricle ejection fraction was estimated by transthoracic echocardiography performed by cardiologists with expertise in congenital heart disease.

The following parameters were recorded in the haemodynamic study: mean pulmonary artery pressure, inferior vena cava pressure, cardiac index calculated by Fick formula (L/min/m2), hepatic vein pressure, hepatic vein wedge pressure, and hepatic vein pressure gradient.

When a prospective haemodynamic evaluation was not performed, haemodynamic data were retrieved from the previous year if the patient had not undergone major cardiac surgery.

SECTION

Statistical analysis and sample size estimation

PARAGRAPH

Quantitative variables are expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and range when these were non-normally distributed.

Normality was tested through distributional graphs and the Shapiro-Wilk test.

Frequency counts and percentages were used for categorical data.

95% confidence intervals (CI) for proportions were calculated by the Wilson method.

Continuous variables were tested using parametric (t-test) and nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney U test) when appropriate.

Chi-squared and Fisher’s exact tests were used for categorical data.

Predictors of the presence of LN (any type of LN and LI-RADS ≥ 3) on MRI/CT were assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis.

Variables found to be significant (P < 0.1) in the univariate analysis were entered in a multivariable binomial logistic regression through backward stepwise modelling.

Time since surgery was entered as a binary variable (≤ 10 vs > 10 years) in the logistic model to meet the assumption that independent variables must be linearly related to the logit of the outcome.

This time threshold was based on previous position statements on FALD [12].

PARAGRAPH

Based on previous reports, we assumed a prevalence of LN of 40% on MRI/CT [14].

Assuming an α value of 0.05, attrition rate of 5%, and an absolute error of 8%, our initial sample size estimation was 153.

For multivariate analyses, the rule of a minimum of ten events per variable was used [15].

PARAGRAPH

Sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios and predictive values of abdominal US for the diagnosis of LN (any type of LN and LI-RADS ≥ 3) were calculated, setting MRI/CT scan as the reference technique.

Inter-test agreement between US and MRI/CT was calculated via the prevalence-adjusted and bias-adjusted kappa statistic [16].

PARAGRAPH

The following post-hoc univariate comparisons were performed to identify the reason for the low sensitivity of US found in the primary analysis: (1) LN seen on MRI/CT and not detected on US vs. LN seen on US and MRI/CT, (2) LN seen on US and not confirmed by MRI/CT vs LN seen on US and MRI/CT and (3) to address the possibility of a selection bias, we assessed any difference in results between patients who underwent all planned imaging procedures (n = 130) and the initial study population (n =152).

Finally, an exploratory analysis was performed to assess whether the presence of two or more imaging signs of advanced chronic liver disease (blunt liver margin, heterogeneous liver parenchyma, portal vein > 13 mm, ascites or spleen long axis > 13 cm) were more common in patients with LN.

PARAGRAPH

All tests were two-tailed.

Significance was set at P < 0.05.

Data were analyzed at the promoting institution (Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal, Madrid) using STATA software version 14.1 (StataCorp.

Texas, USA).

RESULTS

SECTION

Study population

PARAGRAPH

The number of patients enrolled was 152 (Figure 1, study flowchart).

Mean age was 27.3 years (SD: 7.8); 83 were male (54.6%).

The most common congenital heart defects treated with FS were tricuspid atresia (44.7%), double inlet left ventricle (22.4%) and pulmonary atresia (13.2%).

The mean time from FS to inclusion was 18.3 years (SD: 7.6).

Extracardiac connection was the most frequent surgical procedure (64.5%).

Although in 39 (25.7%) patients ejection fraction was below the normal range, the mean value in the whole cohort (56%) was within the normal limits (55 - 70%).

PARAGRAPH

Total bilirubin, transaminases, alpha-fetoprotein, C-reactive protein, and albumin were within the normal range; while mean GGT (100 IU/ml) was slightly increased.

Seven patients (4.6%) showed elevated alpha-fetoprotein (normal range: 0 – 8 IU/mL), which was above 15 IU/mL in only two patients, who were subsequently diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma.

Four patients were diagnosed with chronic HCV infection and one patient had previously achieved a sustained virologic response with antiviral treatment.

Mean liver stiffness was 26.1 kPa (SD: 15.1).

Hemodynamic data were available from 66 patients.

Mean hepatic venous pressure gradient was 2 mmHg (SD: 1.2, range: 0 – 6).

Additional baseline characteristics are provided in Table 1.

SECTION

Abdominal ultrasonography

PARAGRAPH

The prevalence of patients with LN on US was 29.6% (45/152; 95% CI: 22.9 – 37.3%).

The median number of nodules per patient was 2 and mean nodule size was 11 mm.

Nodules were usually round (83.3%), hyperechoic (76.5%), and peripherally located in the liver (66.6%).

Heterogeneous echogenicity (69.7%) and liver surface nodularity (54%) were frequent.

Mean portal (10.2 mm) and central hepatic (8.9 mm) vein diameters were normal.

Ascites was present in 29 patients (19.2%).

Additional US findings are summarised in Table 2.

PARAGRAPH

Of the initial study population (n = 152), 130 patients underwent MRI (n = 93) or CT (n = 37).

Nine patients refused MRI/CT; in 3 patients an MRI or CT scan was not deemed appropriate by the physician in charge due to poor heart functional status; and ten patients did not adhere to the protocol (in 3 patients > 6 months had elapsed between US and MRI/CT and 7 did not attend the scheduled visits for cross-sectional imaging).

Demographic and clinical variables and LN prevalences and features were similar in patients that did or did not comply with the established protocol (Supplementary Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

A higher prevalence of LN was detected on MRI/CT than on abdominal US (62/130, 47.7%; 95% CI: 39.3 - 56.2%) amounting to a total of 173 nodules of median size 9 mm.

Nodules were often hyperenhancing in the arterial phase (92.3%), round (90.3%), and peripherally located (74.8%).

When the LI-RADS classification was applied, LI-RADS-3 nodules (59.4%) were the most frequent type.

Eleven LN (7.1%) showed washout.

Additional nodule characteristics on MRI/CT are provided in Table 3.

PARAGRAPH

In the univariate analysis, symptomatic protein-losing enteropathy (p = 0.026) and time since FS > 10 years (p = 0.037) were associated with the presence of LN (Table 4).

In the logistic regression, only the latter remained as a significant predictor of any type of LN (FS > 10 years OR = 4.18, 95% CI: 1.07 – 16.4; P = 0.040).

Additionally, in the exploratory analysis, time since FS > 10 years was also the single predictor of LI-RADS ≥ 3 LN (OR = 4.23, 95% CI: 1.03 – 17.6; P = 0.046) (Supplementary Table 2).

The number of patients with nodules paralleled the number of years elapsed from FS (Supplementary Table 3).

SECTION

Summary of sensitivity, specificity and predictive values

PARAGRAPH

The sensitivity of US for the diagnosis of LN was 50% (95% CI: 37.9 - 62.1%) and specificity 85.3% (95% CI: 75 - 91.8%).

Global accuracy was 68.5% (95% CI: 60 – 75.8%).

PARAGRAPH

For tests restricted to the detection of LI-RADS ≥ 3 LN, sensitivity was 56% (95% CI: 42.3 - 68.8%) and specificity 83.8% (95% CI: 74.2 – 90.3%).

Global accuracy was 73.1% (95% CI: 64.9 - 80%).

Predictive values and likelihood ratios are provided in Supplementary Table 4

SECTION

Patients with liver nodules highly suspicious of malignancy

PARAGRAPH

Table 5 describes the characteristics of the 8 patients (8/130, 6.1%) with LN highly suspicious of malignancy (i.e. LI-RADS 4-5) on cross-sectional imaging.

US did not identify the LN in 2 of these 8 patients.

Biopsy of LN was undertaken on 7 of these 8 patients and showed hepatocellular carcinoma in 2 patients, and absence of malignancy in the other 5 (prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma 1.3%).

The hepatocellular carcinoma nodules were isoechoic on US and patients had elevated alpha-fetoprotein (272 and 339 IU/mL).

One of these 2 patients had serologic features of spontaneous clearance of HCV infection (antiHCV+, HCV-RNA –) and had not received antiviral therapy; while the other lacked additional etiological factors of chronic liver disease.

Finally, a patient with a 17 mm LN hypervascular and with washout, and with normal serum alfa-fetoprotein refused to undergo biopsy.

The LN of the latter patient has remained unchanged in 3- 6- and 12-month CT scans.

SECTION

Inter-test agreement and post-hoc analyses of liver nodules

PARAGRAPH

Inter-test US vs. MRI/CT agreement was low (prevalence-adjusted and bias-adjusted kappa statistic = 0.34).

In ten patients, LN seen on US were not confirmed in the MRI/CT scan.

These lesions were smaller (median size: 0.6 mm, P = 0.036) and more often hyperechoic (95.7%, P = 0.038) than LN detected with both imaging techniques (Supplementary Table 5).

PARAGRAPH

In 31 out of 62 patients in whom LN were seen in the MRI/CT scan, US did not detect any lesion.

LN exclusively detected on MRI/CT were more often hypervascular (96.6%, P = 0.03) than those identified with both imaging techniques (86.6%).

No further significant differences were found (Supplementary Table 5).

Interestingly, LN with biopsy-proven hepatocellular carcinoma were detected by CT/MRI and US.

PARAGRAPH

The presence of ≥2 imaging signs of advanced chronic liver disease did not predict the presence of LN (P = 0.23) on US or MRI/CT (P = 0.74) (Supplementary Table 6)

SECTION

DISCUSSION

PARAGRAPH

This study prospectively examines the prevalence and imaging features of LN in a large series of Fontan patients.

Our findings indicate that i) LN are common and their frequency increases in parallel to the time elapsed since Fontan surgery, ii) US shows a rather low sensitivity to identify LN, iii) most of these nodules show hypervascular behaviour on CT/MRI but result on non-neoplastic regenerative hepatocytes, and iv) hepatocellular carcinoma is a possibility, albeit unlikely.

PARAGRAPH

Liver nodules were detected in approximately half of the study participants.

Reported prevalences of LN in patients with FALD have been lower, ranging from 17 to 40% [7,8,14,17,18].

The higher prevalence detected here could be explained by the exclusive use of US or the retrospective and non-systematic assessment of LN in previous studies.

In addition, our cohort showed a higher mean time since FS, which is a known risk factor for advanced chronic liver disease and hepatic complications [5,12,19,20].

PARAGRAPH

Upon US, we observed that LN were commonly hyperechoic, < 2 cm, multiple, and located in the periphery of the liver, in line with the findings of US studies conducted on smaller samples [17,21].

Some nodules, especially when small (< 1 cm) and hyperechoic, were not reproduced in the MRI/CT scan.

According to some authors, some of these LN exclusively visible on US examination could represent small areas with microvascular disturbances or early-stage fibrosis [17].

As expected, additional signs suggestive of liver disease such as liver contour nodularity, heterogeneous parenchyma and ascites were commonly encountered.

Interestingly, our results show that classical imaging signs of advanced chronic liver disease do not predict the presence of LN.

PARAGRAPH

One of our main findings was that the sensitivity of US for the diagnosis of LN was low.

This could be because US is more operator-dependent than MRI/CT scanning and the vascular nature of LN in FALD.

Actually, some lesions were only seen in the arterial phase after contrast injection and arterial hyperenhancement was more common in LN that were not detected by US.

In a recent study examining 49 Fontan patients, it was found that LN were missed on US in approximately 30% of cases [8].

Taken together, these observations suggest that contrast-enhanced modalities may be more suitable to identify the full spectrum of LN in patients with FALD.

US did not detect any LN in two patients with LI-RADS 5 lesions, but very importantly did not miss any case of hepatocellular carcinoma in our cohort and, consequently, we cannot conclude from our data that this imaging modality should be ruled out as a screening tool.

To date, only one study has assessed the benefits of surveillance imaging in FALD [22].

Because of the retrospective design and heterogeneity of intervals and imaging techniques in this study, the authors could only recommend surveillance.

However, the optimal management strategy for these patients remains to be established.

PARAGRAPH

A high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is a major concern and this is what prompted our study.

However, despite the high prevalence of LN in our FS cohort, the proportion of malignant LN was low.

Post-mortem series and biopsy studies have shown that most LN correspond to focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) or benign regenerative nodules [6,7,18,21,23].

FNH is a polyclonal lesion occurring in the setting of normal parenchyma and has been linked to a hyperplastic response to increased blood flow induced by a focal vascular abnormality [24].

As shown here, hepatic adenoma may also appear after FS and there have been some case reports in FALD [23].

Adenoma underdiagnosis is a possibility, as these may resemble FNH-like lesions in terms of size, imaging and histological features [25].

In some of our patients with biopsy-proven non-malignant lesions washout features were found.

Interestingly, a low specificity of washout to diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma has been also recently described in a French cohort of patients with BCS [26].

In another recent study, it was shown that benign hyperenhancing nodules detected after FS may display washout and be mistaken for hepatocellular carcinoma according to imaging criteria [18].

As shown in our two patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, alpha-fetoprotein is usually elevated in cases of malignancy, as occurs in BCS [10,11,27,28].

Based on our results, we would argue that the hepatocellular carcinoma diagnostic criteria used in cirrhosis are not applicable in FALD, and biopsy confirmation is always required [9,18,23].

PARAGRAPH

The origin of LN has been linked to perfusion disturbances in the liver parenchyma secondary to Fontan circulation, similar to the nodules encountered in BCS and other vascular liver diseases [6,7,18,24].

It should be noted that extrapolating data from BCS and other forms of liver cirrhosis may be inaccurate, since the portal hypertension model in FALD is characteristically hypodynamic and arterial splanchnic perfusion may also be impaired, as shown in Doppler studies [29].

In fact, this is what makes FALD a unique entity.

Some authors propose that impaired hepatic venous outflow caused by elevated right central pressures leads to atrophy and hypoxia-induced damage, followed by a compensatory mechanism characterised by the arterialisation of liver parenchyma and regenerative changes [7,14].

Elevated right pressures and liver stiffness have also been described as potential markers of LN in univariate analyses of previous studies, but these results were not reproduced here [7,8].

Inflammation and cholestatic-induced injury are thought to play a minor role in LN and FALD progression [5,7,23].

In contrast, we identified time since FS > 10 years as a predictive factor for LN.

This is an important finding providing further support for the expert-based consensus that liver assessment is mandatory 10 years after FS [30].

PARAGRAPH

Our study has some limitations.

First, it could be argued that some lesions that were not biopsied could harbour hepatocellular carcinoma.

However, available data suggest that hepatocellular carcinoma in FALD usually presents with suspicious radiological features (i.e. hyperenhancing nodules with washout) or elevated alpha-fetoprotein.

Moreover, liver biopsy in patients with elevated systemic pressures who are frequently under antithrombotic treatment carries a significant risk of adverse events.

Considering that all but one patient with LN showing worrisome features underwent biopsy, we believe that the risk of underdiagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma is likely to be low.

Secondly, some patients did not undergo the same cross-sectional imaging.

CT scanning was reserved for patients in whom MRI was contraindicated to minimize radiation exposure in this young population.

Further, according to a recent report, agreement between MRI and CT is high in the FALD setting (kappa statistic = 0.85) [8].

Third, LI-RADS classification has been developed to standardise the reporting of LN in patients with cirrhosis, but it has not been validated in patients with FALD.

Therefore, the LI-RADS sub-analysis in our series should be regarded as merely exploratory, since the absence of validation of LI-RADS criteria in FALD precludes its application in this population.

Finally, our study design precluded any assessment of the natural history of LN in the long-term.

We anticipate that further longitudinal study of this cohort will shed some light on this issue.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, LN frequently appear in FALD and may not be detected in an US exam.

These nodules are usually hyperechoic, hypervascular, mainly located in the liver periphery and are more often encountered later than ten years after FS.

The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is low but present, and its diagnosis requires biopsy confirmation.
