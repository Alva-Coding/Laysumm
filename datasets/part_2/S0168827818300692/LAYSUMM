TITLE

Intra-arterial idarubicin_lipiodol without embolisation in hepatocellular carcinoma: The LIDA-B phase I trial

PARAGRAPH

There is a need for transarterial regimens that improve the responses and survival of patients with unresectable HCC.

In this phase I trial, we showed that two sessions of treatment with a transarterial idarubicin_lipiodol emulsion without embolisation was well tolerated and gave promising efficacy in terms of tumour control and patient survival.
