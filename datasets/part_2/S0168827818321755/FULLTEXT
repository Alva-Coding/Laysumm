TITLE

The nuclear bile acid receptor FXR is a PKA- and FOXA2-sensitive activator of fasting hepatic gluconeogenesis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Glucose supply to tissues is maintained through a complex regulatory network mostly driven by the pancreatic hormones insulin and glucagon which control glucose use, storage and synthesis.

Through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, the liver contributes to ∼70–80% of glucose production during an overnight fast,1 the remaining 30% coming from intestinal and kidney gluconeogenesis in physiological conditions.2,3

PARAGRAPH

Glucagon-induced gluconeogenesis is the only source of glucose when glycogen stores are exhausted during fasting.

Gluconeogenic substrates (lactate, alanine, and pyruvate) are funneled to mitochondria to generate oxaloacetate (OAA) through biotin-dependent pyruvate carboxylase.

Cytosolic OAA is decarboxylated and phosphorylated to yield phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), the primary building block of glucose, through phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCK), a rate-limiting enzyme of gluconeogenesis.

Glycerol from triglyceride breakdown also contributes by varying extents to gluconeogenesis, feeding into the gluconeogenic pathway as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to generate fructose 1,6-biphosphate, the substrate of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) which irreversibly yields fructose 6-phosphate (F6P).4

The regulation of hepatic glucose production (HGP) is achieved through a sophisticated signaling network involving post-translational protein modifications, allosteric regulation and transcription factor activation and repression5,6 which essentially control the gene expression of three rate-limiting enzymes, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc), Fbp1 and PEPCK (Pck1)7 in a glucagon/cAMP-dependent manner.8–11

PARAGRAPH

Multiple transcription factors orchestrate hepatic gluconeogenesis, such as PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC1α), Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), small heterodimer partner (SHP) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), by regulating the expression of gluconeogenic genes.12

The nuclear bile acid (BA) receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a key regulator of essential hepatic functions.13

Besides acting on BA homeostasis and lipid metabolism, FXR participates in the regulation of glucose homeostasis.

Sequestration of intestinal BAs decreases plasma glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes.14

This effect correlates with increased GLP-1 expression and secretion which may be attributed at least in part to FXR-mediated ChREBP inhibition in intestinal L-cells,15 a mechanism equally operative in the liver, where FXR represses glycolysis.16,17

Liver FXR controls HGP through the regulation of Pck1 and G6pc gene expression.

Indeed, in vivo administration of natural or synthetic FXR agonists improves glucose tolerance, decreases Pck1 and G6pc expression and accordingly diminishes HGP in rodent models of obesity or diabetes.18–22

Gene deletion studies mostly support a repressive role of FXR on gluconeogenesis,18,20 consistent with the reported inhibitory action of SHP, a direct FXR target gene, on gluconeogenic gene expression in vivo20 and in vitro.23,24

However, whereas FXR activation may improve glucose metabolism by downregulating HGP in pathological models of obesity and diabetes, its role in physiological fasting conditions appears different.

Fxr−/− mice develop transient hypoglycemia and exhibit a delayed increase in HGP upon fasting.25–28

In addition, the induction of hepatic G6pc and Pck1 expression is significantly blunted in fasting Fxr−/− mice.26,29

Taken together, these data point to pro-gluconeogenic properties of FXR during fasting.

Since the molecular mechanisms of FXR action in fasting are unknown, we studied the role of FXR in the control of HGP and gluconeogenic gene expression in physiological fasting.

FXR enhances cAMP-induced glucose production by mouse primary hepatocytes

PARAGRAPH

To evaluate the contribution of FXR to fasting HGP, C57Bl6/J Fxr+/+ or Fxr−/− mice (Fig. S1A) were subjected to fasting to deplete hepatic glycogen stores and an intraperitoneal pyruvate tolerance test was performed.

The glycemic excursion in response to pyruvate was blunted in C57Bl6/J Fxr−/− mice when compared to Fxr+/+ mice (Fig. 1A), suggesting a positive contribution of FXR to HGP.

The ability of FXR to regulate glucose production by MPHs from Fxr+/+ or Fxr−/− mice was assayed after an 8 h-treatment with the synthetic FXR agonist GW4064, with or without the protein kinase A (PKA) activator 8-CPT-cAMP (Fig. 1B), under experimental conditions defined as optimal for observing glucose production by isolated hepatocytes (Fig. S1B,C).

GW4064 did not significantly affect GP, whereas 8-CPT-cAMP and glucagon increased glucose production (Fig. S2A).

Simultaneous activation of PKA and FXR with GW4064 or the natural FXR agonist CDCA potentiated glucose production (Fig. 1B, S2B).

While showing a lower basal glucose production, Fxr−/− MPHs were similarly sensitive to PKA stimulation as Fxr+/+ MPHs [fold change (FC) ∼2], but were insensitive to FXR agonism (Fig. 1B), like wild-type MPHs in which Fxr mRNA expression was knocked down (Fig. S3A,B).

The expression of the gluconeogenic Foxo1 transcription factor did not vary between the two genotypes and was mildly induced by glucagon (Fig. S3C,D).

Foxo1 knockdown, while affecting basal glucose production by MPHs, did not affect the potentiation of cAMP by the FXR agonist (Fig. S3E,F).

We conclude that FXR activation enhances HGP under conditions mimicking fasting, independently of FOXO1.

SECTION

The glucagon/PKA pathway differentially regulates FXR-driven gene expression

PARAGRAPH

The crosstalk between the glucagon/cAMP and FXR signaling pathways was investigated at the gene expression level.

Gene expression patterns from naive or glucagon-treated MPHs, with or without GW4064 stimulation, were assayed at normal glucose concentrations to avoid interference with the energy- or glucose-sensitive AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or hexosamine pathways, respectively.31,32

A significant portion of upregulated genes became refractory to FXR agonism in the presence of glucagon (Fig. 1C).

Conversely, a set of 71 transcripts either poorly modulated, or not modulated, by GW4064 became sensitive to FXR agonism in the presence of glucagon (Fig. 1C and Fig. S4A,B), with 45 out of 71 transcripts being induced in physiological or prolonged fasting conditions in vivo (Table S1).

A gene ontology term enrichment analysis identified transcription- and glucose metabolism-related processes as significantly represented within these two gene clusters (Fig. 1C).

Further examination using gene and protein assays pointed to known FXR-regulated genes and gluconeogenic genes, as becoming sensitive (Fbp1, Pck1, G6pc, Slc51b/Ostβ) or refractory (Shp/Nr0b2, Abcb11/Bsep and Abcc4/Mdr3) to FXR synthetic or natural agonists in the presence of glucagon in an FXR-dependent manner (Fig. S4B-D, S5, S6A-F).

PARAGRAPH

The expression of catalytic PKA subunits α and β (Prkaca and Prkacb, Fig. S6G) was necessary for the synergistic induction of Fbp1, Pck1 and G6pc by FXR and cAMP (Fig. 1D-F) but did not alter Shp/Nr0b2 responsiveness to FXR agonism in the presence of a cAMP analogue (Fig. 1G).

Importantly, these transcriptional effects translated into an altered biological output since cAMP-induced and cAMP/FXR-regulated glucose production were blunted upon PKA knockdown (Fig. 1H).

Thus, the potentiation of glucagon-stimulated glucose production by FXR agonism relates to a combinatorial upregulation of gluconeogenesis-promoting, glucagon/PKA-regulated genes (Fbp1, Pck1, G6pc) and downregulation of the gluconeogenesis-inhibiting, PKA-independent Shp gene.

SECTION

Phosphorylation of FXR S325 and S357 by PKA regulates FXR activity

PARAGRAPH

We then assessed whether FXR is a direct PKA target.

Purified mouse FXRα1 or FXRα3 were used in an in vitro phosphorylation assay, in which an efficient PKA-dependent transfer of radiolabeled phosphate to both FXR isoforms was observed (Fig. S7A) and of similar magnitude to that observed with protein kinase C alpha, a previously identified FXR kinase (Fig. S7B).33

Mass spectrometry identified phosphopeptides (Fig. 2A, Fig. S8) that corresponded to three bioinformatically-predicted and two de novo identified phosphoserines (S132, S151, S357 and S114, S325 respectively, Fig. 2A).

GSK3β, which is regulated by PKA,34 was unable to phosphorylate FXR in similar conditions (Fig. S7C).

PARAGRAPH

FXR transcriptional activity in response to PKA activation was tested using a transactivation assay in which FXR is expressed as a Gal4-DNA binding domain fusion protein (one-hybrid assay, Fig. 2B).

While FXR was insensitive to PKA stimulation in the absence of the FXR agonist GW4064 (Fig. 2B), activation of PKA by the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin increased agonist-induced FXR activity (Fig. 2B).

A similar potentiating effect was observed when using an IR1-driven reporter gene, mFXRα1 (Fig. 2C).

S325 and S357 were necessary and sufficient for PKA-enhanced FXR activity (Fig. S9A, Fig. 2C).

As individual mutations of S325 and S357 to alanine affected neither the response to GW4064 (Fig. 2C) nor FXR protein stability (Fig. S9B), we concluded that these mutations did not introduce major structural changes.

PARAGRAPH

The contribution of FXR phosphorylation by PKA to HGP was characterized in Fxr−/− cells, in which wild-type or S325,357A FXR was expressed (Fig. 2D).

While wild-type FXR restored the GW4064-induced potentiation of glucose production triggered by PKA activation, the FXR mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated, did not convey this synergistic response.

Importantly, G6pc, Pck1 and Fbp1 gene expression followed a similar pattern (Fig. S9C-E).

SECTION

PKA potentiates FXR-induced gene transcription

PARAGRAPH

How FXR and PKA cooperatively regulate gluconeogenesis was investigated for the two cAMP-regulated gluconeogenic genes Fbp1 and Pck1.

FXR binding site(s) coordinates were identified in the Fbp1 and Pck1 upstream regulatory regions (URRs) using ChIP-seq data from mouse livers after fasting32,35 (Fig. 3A, S10A), which overlapped with CREB DNA binding sites.36

The DNA sequences encompassing both FXR and CREB co-binding regions (CBRs) were cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene to assess their functionality.

Transactivation assays (Fig. 3B, S10B,C) showed that the PKA-FXR cooperativity was maintained on these chimeric constructs when using the wild-type FXR.

However, FXR S325,357 to A mutations ablated this cooperative effect in line with the observed effect on HGP.

Endogenous gene regulation was measured in MPHs (Fig. 3C, S10D) in which either Creb1 or Fxr expression was knocked down (Fig. 3D, S3B).

In line with our previous results, FXR was required for the cooperative response with glucagon (Fig. 3C, S10D).

CREB contributed to the cooperative induction, in agreement with FXR co-binding with CREB to both the Fbp1 (Fig. 3E,F) and Pck1 URRs (Fig. S10E,F).

Strikingly, the FXR density in URRs was highest when MPHs were simultaneously treated with GW4064 and glucagon (Fig. 3E, S10E), suggesting that increased transcription may stem from increased or stabilized binding of FXR to DNA.

SECTION

Glucagon abrogates FXR-mediated transcription of Shp/Nr0b2 URR through FOXA2

PARAGRAPH

FXR-induced expression of Nr0b2/Shp is counteracted by glucagon and cAMP analogues in a PKA-independent manner (Fig. 1G).

Although many mechanisms may account for the observed inhibition of FXR transcriptional activity, we hypothesized that it results from a functional interaction with a glucagon/cAMP-sensitive transcriptional regulator (TR).

Since a similar regulation pattern of Nr0b2/Shp was observed in both hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells and MPHs (Fig. 4A, 4C, S11A-C) and confirmed at the protein level (Fig. 4C), we tested this hypothesis by determining which TRs co-localize closely with FXR in the HepG2 cell genome by comparing the FXR cistrome31 to that of 51 TRs generated by the ENCODE Consortium37 (Fig. S12A).

PARAGRAPH

FXR co-localizing TRs included the FXR obligate heterodimerization partner RXRα,38 validating this approach to identify direct, functionally relevant, protein-protein interactions.

Forkhead box A2 transcription factor (FOXA2) appeared as a potential candidate (Fig. S12A), as its activity is inhibited by insulin and enhanced by glucagon in mouse livers.39,40

FOXA2 co-occupied FXR genomic binding sites, with 1,642 FOXA2 binding sites being detected within +/− 100 bp from the center of the detected 11,574 FXR peaks (Fig. 4B).

These CBRs were enriched in consensus binding sequences for FXR and FOXA2 as previously reported,41 Distances between FXR and FOXA2 binding sites diverged from the ones obtained by a random repartition of the same number of ATF3 binding regions (Fig. 4B).

A similar analysis comparing the liver FXR and FOXA2 cistromes in the liver genomes of mice after fasting35,42 yielded a figure similar to that extracted from HepG2 cell cistromes, with 1,219 FXR/FOXA2 CBRs out of 7,457 total FXR binding sites (Fig. 4D).

Interestingly, several CBR-associated genes are involved in glucose metabolic processes (Fig. 4D).

The contribution of FOXA2 to FXR-regulated transcription was then characterized by microarray analysis of RNAs from wild-type or FOXA2-depleted MPHs after glucagon or insulin stimulation (Fig. 4E and Fig. S12B, C, D).

In control MPHs (Ad-shLacZ), a subset of genes (197) displayed a reduced inducibility by GW4064 in the presence of glucagon (Fig. 4E, lanes 3 vs. 4) when compared to GW4064 treatment in the presence of insulin (Fig. 4E, lanes 1 vs. 2).

The ability of glucagon to blunt the expression of this subset of FXR-inducible genes was lost in Foxa2-depleted cells (Ad-shFoxa2) (Fig. 4E, lanes 7 vs. 8, compare to 3 vs. 4), thereby identifying FOXA2 as a repressor of a subset of FXR-regulated genes.

In particular, glucagon-mediated repression of Shp/Nr0b2 was FOXA2-dependent (Fig. 4F), thereby identifying FOXA2 as a critical regulator of FXR activity at this locus.

Finally, blunting FOXA2 expression in MPHs (Fig. S12E) decreased glucose production in response to cAMP alone or to cAMP and GW4064 in a Shp/Nr0b2-dependent manner (Fig. 4G, S12E).

This suggests that FOXA2 positively contributes to FXR-independent and FXR-induced gluconeogenesis by inhibiting Shp expression.

SECTION

FOXA2 interacts with DNA-bound FXR at the Shp/Nr0b2 locus

PARAGRAPH

FXR and FOXA2 both bind to the Shp URR in mouse liver (Fig. 5A).

FOXA2 DNA binding was dependent on FXR (Fig. 5B) and was increased by glucagon and GW4064 (Fig. 5C).

A ChIP-reChIP analysis confirmed the co-localization of these two TRs at this genomic locus (Fig. 5D).

GST pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays established that FXR specifically interacts with FOXA2 in HepG2 cells (Fig. 5E,F) and in mouse liver (Fig. S12F).

FOXA2 binding to the Shp URR was also FXR-dependent in the immortalized mouse hepatocyte cell line AML12 (Fig. 6A), which displays transcriptional regulatory features similar to HepG2 cells and MPHs (Fig. S11A,B;S13).

FOXA2 opposed FXR-mediated activation of Shp/Nr0b2 (Fig. 6B), however FXR binding was not dependent on FOXA2 (Fig. 6C).

FOXA2 inhibited the FXR-mediated induction of an IR1 FXRE-driven reporter gene by all four FXR isoforms (Fig. 6D,E).

The DNA binding activity of FOXA2 relies on the integrity of a highly conserved winged-helix DNA binding domain.

Mutation of S237 and W239 within this domain abolishes DNA binding43 and FOXA2 transcriptional activity (Fig. 6F).

Comparing the repressive activity of wild-type FOXA2 to that of the DNA binding-crippled FOXA2 in the IR1 FXRE-tk-Luc transactivation assay demonstrated that the repressive activity of FOXA2 is independent of its interaction with DNA (Fig. 6G).

Thus, FOXA2 likely represses FXR transcriptional activity by a tethering mechanism.

SECTION

FOXA2 and PKA regulate FXR target genes independently

PARAGRAPH

Whether PKA-regulated FXR target genes are also sensitive to the insulin-inhibited, glucagon-activated FOXA2 transcription factor was investigated next.

The FOXA2 target gene Igfbp1 was induced by glucagon in a FOXA2-dependent manner and was insensitive to FXR agonism in both wild-type and Foxa2-depleted MPHs (Fig. 7A).

The FXR target gene Ostβ was induced upon FXR agonism, but not by glucagon treatment.

Simultaneous treatment with glucagon and GW4064 cooperatively induced Ostβ expression in a FOXA2-independent manner (Fig. 7B).

Expression of the gluconeogenic genes Fbp1, Pck1 and G6pc was induced by glucagon and further enhanced by FXR agonist treatment, a response which was not altered by Foxa2 knockdown (Fig. 7C-E).

This suggests that the FOXA2 and PKA signaling pathways regulate distinct subsets of FXR-responsive genes, cooperating to enhance HGP (Fig. 7F).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Glucose homeostasis is regulated by a complex and intricate signaling network involving multiple organs.

The BA nuclear receptor FXR is integrated into this regulatory network and participates in glucose handling and metabolism.

Intestinal FXR favors glucose absorption and induces FGF15/19 secretion which, through signaling via the hepatic β-Klotho/FGFR4 membrane receptor, inhibits GSK3β, hence increasing glycogenesis.

Liver FXR inhibits ChREBP activity, hence decreasing glycolysis and pancreatic FXR potentiates glucose-induced insulin secretion.

All these effects contribute to maintain glucose homeostasis in the post-prandial state44 and led to the prediction that FXR activation could favorably impact on glucose metabolism.

Prolonged in vivo activation of FXR by natural or synthetic agonists led to unclear results.

Contrasting with cholic acid treatment of C57BL/6J mice (five days), GW4064 treatment did not modulate gluconeogenic gene expression.20

GW4064 treatment for seven days in C57Bl6 mice increased the expression of gluconeogenic genes without detectable increases in plasma glucose45 Fasting plasma glucose was increased in high fat diet-fed C57BL/6J mice treated for three months with GW406446 but decreased after a six-week treatment.22

Thus, long term interference of the FXR signaling pathway by either whole body gene knockout or prolonged agonist treatment did not provide information on a potential role of FXR in the highly dynamic physiological fasting response, which we investigated in this study.

PARAGRAPH

In our study, FXR acts positively on the gluconeogenic pathways through two arms.

The first positive arm is controlled through the novel glucagon/cAMP/PKA/FXR pathway, which potentiates gluconeogenic gene transcription.

This synergy requires PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of FXR on S325 and S357 and CREB, which co-localizes with FXR at the Fbp1 and Pck1 URRs.

ChIP-PCR assays showed that PKA activation correlates with increased FXR DNA binding.

Three-dimensional structures of the FXR ligand binding domain bound to natural or synthetic ligands show that S325 is located in helix 7 (H7) which constitutes part of the coactivator LXXLL binding groove and is poorly exposed to solvent in the agonist-bound, coactivator-FXR complex.

S357 localizes on the β-loop connecting H7 and H8 and is more accessible to solvent than S325 in this configuration.

In light of these structural data, it is still unclear how phosphorylation of S325 and S357 might increase/stabilize DNA binding.

PARAGRAPH

Nevertheless, our data add PKA to the growing list of metabolism-sensitive FXR modifiers that includes O-GlcNAc transferase,31 AMPK,32 protein kinase C alpha,33 sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and p300.47,48

A pending question is how these post-translational modifications (PTMs) vary according to the metabolic status.

Prolonged energy shortage could lead to selective activation of AMPK and FXR inhibition, whereas PKA would predominantly specify FXR activity in normal fasting conditions.

These PTMs have been studied independently and Sirt1-mediated deacetylation and activation of FXR is likely to directly superimpose its regulatory effect on FXR transcriptional activity.

As daily variation of protein subcellular localization, phosphorylation and activities49,50 are very likely to top on these metabolically-regulated FXR functional alterations, it becomes mandatory to decipher the PTM code of FXR during fasting/feeding periods to fully appreciate how this affects FXR-regulated biological output(s).

These outputs might extend beyond metabolic control, as we recently showed that liver FXR may also regulate other specific gene sets and biological pathways as it interacts with other TRs.51

PARAGRAPH

The prototypical FXR target gene Shp/Nr0b2 controls BA synthesis and lipogenesis52 and has been proposed to be a negative regulator of gluconeogenesis through interactions with the pro-gluconeogenic glucocorticoid receptor, HNF4α, Foxo-related transcription factors or C/EBPα.53

This repressive activity provides a direct link between the observed plasma glucose lowering effect of prolonged FXR agonism in mice and gluconeogenic gene transcription.

Our data however show that FoxA2 could serve as a repressor of FXR transcriptional activity on a limited number of genes, including Shp/Nr0b2, in short-term fasting conditions which represents another example of signal integration at specific genes.

FOXA2-mediated repression of FXR activity proceeds from a DNA binding-independent mechanism, and affects a limited number of genes with no common function, as studied by gene set enrichment analysis or gene ontology term enrichment analysis (data not shown).

The repression of Shp gene transcription by FOXA2 is intriguing in light of the ability of SHP to prevent FOXA2 DNA binding in vitro.54

However, the physiological significance of these findings is unclear, as these investigations were carried out without including hormonal signals such as glucagon, which triggers FOXA2 acetylation and subsequent activation to control fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis in a process involving Sirt1 and p300.55

It is important to note here that our mechanistic investigations were carried out at normal glucose concentrations to avoid any confounding effects related to either energy depletion, hence activating Sirt1 and/or AMPK, or to glucose overload, hence activating the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway.

A highly integrative approach combining biochemical, proteomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic approaches is required to fully understand PTM-dependent FXR activity variations in the physiologically-varying fasting and fed conditions, to which we now add the glucagon/cAMP pathway as an important regulator of FXR.

Whether this physiological mechanism is dysregulated in type 2 diabetes remains to be explored.

A decreased activity of both hepatic FOXA2 and FXR through phosphorylation and acetylation, respectively, has been reported in rodent models of T2D,47,56 and we observed that exposure of MPHs to glucolipotoxic conditions abolished FXR’s contribution to glucose production (data not shown).

However, no correlation between FXR expression and that of its cognate target genes could be established with the diabetic status of human patients (Table S2), suggesting that this novel regulatory pathway is more likely at play in physiological conditions.
