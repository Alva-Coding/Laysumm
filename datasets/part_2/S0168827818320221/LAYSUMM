TITLE

Molecular profiling of subclinical inflammatory lesions in long-term surviving adult liver transplant recipients

PARAGRAPH

A large proportion of adult liver transplant recipients who survive for a long time exhibit subclinical histological abnormalities.

The expression profile (a measurement of the activity of genes) of liver tissue from a large fraction of these patients closely resembles the profile of T cell mediated rejection.

Liver allografts showing the highest expression levels of rejection-related genes developed progressive damage over time.
