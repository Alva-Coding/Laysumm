ABSTRACT

TITLE

Outcomes of sequential treatment with sorafenib followed by regorafenib for HCC: Additional analyses from the phase III RESORCE trial

PARAGRAPH

The RESORCE trial showed that regorafenib improves overall survival (OS) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma progressing during sorafenib treatment (hazard ratio [HR] 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50–0.78; p <0.0001).

This exploratory analysis describes outcomes of sequential treatment with sorafenib followed by regorafenib.

PARAGRAPH

In RESORCE, 573 patients were randomized 2:1 to regorafenib 160 mg/day or placebo for 3 weeks on/1 week off.

Efficacy and safety were evaluated by last sorafenib dose.

The time from the start of sorafenib to death was assessed.

Time to progression (TTP) in RESORCE was analyzed by TTP during prior sorafenib treatment.

PARAGRAPH

HRs (regorafenib/placebo) for OS by last sorafenib dose were similar (0.67 for 800 mg/day; 0.68 for <800 mg/day).

Rates of grade 3, 4, and 5 adverse events with regorafenib by last sorafenib dose (800 mg/day vs. <800 mg/day) were 52%, 11%, and 15% vs. 60%, 10%, and 12%, respectively.

Median times (95% CI) from the start of sorafenib to death were 26.0 months (22.6–28.1) for regorafenib and 19.2 months (16.3–22.8) for placebo.

Median time from the start of sorafenib to progression on sorafenib was 7.2 months for the regorafenib arm and 7.1 months for the placebo arm.

An analysis of TTP in RESORCE in subgroups defined by TTP during prior sorafenib in quartiles (Q) showed HRs (regorafenib/placebo; 95% CI) of 0.66 (0.45–0.96; Q1); 0.26 (0.17–0.40; Q2); 0.40 (0.27–0.60; Q3); and 0.54 (0.36–0.81; Q4).

PARAGRAPH

These exploratory analyses show that regorafenib conferred a clinical benefit regardless of the last sorafenib dose or TTP on prior sorafenib.

Rates of adverse events were generally similar regardless of the last sorafenib dose.
