TITLE

Development of a prognostic score to predict response to Yttrium-90 radioembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein invasion

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a global health problem and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death especially in patients with cirrhosis.1,2

By reason of the improvements in surveillance protocols, diagnostic tools and therapeutic armamentaria, diagnosis of early HCC is feasible in 30–60% of cases.3

However, a substantial proportion of patients still present with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) either at onset of the disease or as a result of HCC recurrence or progression, leading to an advanced stage of the disease not amenable to curative treatments.4

Patients with HCC and PVTT may have an asymptomatic presentation, although in most instances they have a significant degree of synthetic dysfunction and an impending liver decompensation that precludes any attempt at surgical cure.

Moreover, when the portal circulation is compromised by thrombosis, transarterial embolo-therapies may increase the risk of liver failure; therefore, the presence of PVTT is generally considered a contraindication to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).5,6

PARAGRAPH

Two pivotal phase III trials have demonstrated a survival advantage for patients with advanced HCC treated with the oral multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib7,8 compared to placebo, and a subgroup analysis has confirmed this result in patients with PVTT.9,10

Sorafenib has therefore been recognized as the standard of care for the treatment of advanced HCC by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD),11 the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)5 and the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL).12

Nevertheless, sustained responses to sorafenib are rare, median survival in patients with advanced HCC remains limited to 6.5–10.7 months, and the treatment itself is associated with side effects that frequently lead to early treatment interruption.7,8,13,14

PARAGRAPH

Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is a form of brachytherapy performed by selective intra-arterial injection of microspheres loaded with Yttrium-90 (Y90): a pure beta-emitter characterized by limited penetration, that enables selective tumor treatment with limited damage to the surrounding tissue.15

Unlike other transarterial therapies, TARE is a microembolic procedure that minimizes alterations of the hepatic arterial flow:16 several large series on TARE for patients with HCC and PVTT, mostly retrospective, showed an acceptable safety profile and good results in terms of local control of the disease.17–21

Only recently, two phase III randomized clinical trials (RCT) comparing TARE to the standard of care sorafenib in the population of patients with locally advanced HCC, have been made accessible.22,23

In both trials the primary endpoint was not met, since TARE did not provide a significant gain in survival compared to sorafenib in the overall population nor in the subgroup of patients with PVTT.

Incidentally, both studies clearly showed a significantly better treatment tolerance and quality of life in patients undergoing TARE.

PARAGRAPH

The aim of this study is to identify, in a prospectively collected series of patients with PVTT treated with TARE, the prognostic factors which impact on patient survival (overall survival [OS]), in order to build a prognostic classification that may enable identification of patients who would benefit most from the treatment.

SECTION

Patients and methods

PARAGRAPH

This is a retrospective single center study on prospectively collected consecutive patients with HCC and PVTT, treated with yttrium-90 radioembolization (TARE) by means of glass microspheres (Therasphere® BTG International Ltd.) over a six year interval, from January 1st 2010 to December 31th 2015.

Inclusion criteria were the following: a) presence of at least one measurable HCC lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria;24 b) presence of PVTT not occluding the main portal trunk c) absence of extrahepatic metastases; d) Child-Pugh score within B7 e) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0–1; f) age >18 years.

Patients with PVTT not meeting such criteria were not considered for TARE, and were indicated sorafenib or best supportive care according to liver function.

PARAGRAPH

Approval for the study was obtained from the local Institutional Review Board.

SECTION

Pre-treatment staging

PARAGRAPH

Pre-treatment assessments and tumor staging of patients were performed the day before 99Tc-macroaggregated albumin (99Tc-MAA) scintigraphy and included: chest CT scan, abdominal contrast-enhanced CT scan or MRI, liver volumetry and calculation of tumor burden (% of tumor volume with respect to liver volume, measured with the CT-Volume Software Siemens Syngo Multimodality Workplace), collection of baseline demographic characteristics and history of previous treatments for HCC, etiology of the underlying liver disease, assessment of patients’ performance status according to the ECOG score, blood tests including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).

Liver function was evaluated according to the Child-Pugh score (CTP), the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score25 and the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade.26

PARAGRAPH

Diagnosis of HCC was made according to radiographic findings or biopsy as defined by EASL/AASLD guidelines.5

Tumor-related PVTT was defined at baseline contrast-enhanced CT scan or MRI as the presence of a filling defect in the portal venous phase, with evidence of enhancement during the arterial phase of dynamic imaging, associated with an HCC.

PVTT extension was graded as PV1 (segmentary), PV2 (secondary order branch), PV3 (first order branch) as previously described.21

Invasion of hepatic veins was defined as presence of tumoral invasion of one or more of the main hepatic veins.

SECTION

Treatment and dosimetry

PARAGRAPH

Informed consent was obtained from all subjects before every angiographic procedure.

TARE was performed in two sessions, as previously described:21 a simulation of treatment was performed by the injection of 99Tc-MAA into the hepatic arterial vasculature reproducing Y90 microspheres distribution, in order to estimate the degree of extrahepatic deposition and tumor uptake by means of planar and SPECT scintigrams; coiling of extrahepatic arteries was performed when required to avoid unintentional deposition.

The dose calculation was based on an individualized treatment planning based on 99mTc-MAA SPECT voxel dosimetry.

The treatment planning evolved along the five years of the study and was aimed at delivering the maximal tolerable parenchyma absorbed dose to limit the risk of liver decompensation.

This value was initially kept low (dosimetric method 1), resulting in about 40 Gy to parenchyma.

Then it was raised to about 70 Gy (dosimetric methods 2 and 3) after our determination of the dose-toxicity curve for patients with HCC treated with 90Y glass microspheres.27

In both methods 1 and 2, patients were treated with one million microspheres per GBq while with method 3, patients were treated with 2.8 million of microspheres per GBq.

PARAGRAPH

The treatment was performed two to three weeks after the simulation, by the injection of glass microspheres loaded with 90Yttrium (TheraSphere®) on the day of admission.

Before injection, patients were given 2 grams of cefazoline intravenously.

After TARE, patients were hospitalized for 48 h for clinical observation and according to safety regulations in our region.

During this period patients underwent blood tests 24 and 48 h after TARE to check for early toxicity, and given anti-emetics and analgesics if needed.

SECTION

Follow-up

PARAGRAPH

After TARE, patients were followed-up on an outpatient basis at months one, three, six and then every four months by means of contrast-enhanced thoraco-abdominal CT scan, physical examination and laboratory analysis including AFP.

Adjunctive visits or hospitalizations were added whenever required depending on patients’ or physicians’ request and on detectable changes in clinical conditions.

PARAGRAPH

Liver decompensation was defined as the occurrence of any of the following: clinically detectable ascites, bleeding from esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy, total bilirubin >3 mg/dl, and prothrombin time international normalized ratio >2.2.21

Tumor progression was assessed according to RECIST criteria 1.1.

The variations of PVTT extension during follow-up were not considered in tumor response evaluation.

All CT scans were independently revised by two experienced radiologists (CSpr, MV); whenever evaluation was not overt, agreement was reached with a third radiologist on staff.

PARAGRAPH

At progression, patients were treated according to disease presentation after multidisciplinary discussion.

In particular, patients that maintained liver function and an intrahepatic progression amenable to locoregional treatments were offered repeated TARE or percutaneous ablation; patients that maintained liver function not amenable to locoregional treatments were offered sorafenib; patient presenting with liver decompensation were offered best supportive care.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Categorical variables were reported as the number of cases and percentages; continuous variables were expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR).

Overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS) and time to liver decompensation were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and calculated from the date of TARE.

Survival curves were compared by the log-rank test.

Median follow-up was calculated with the reverse Kaplan-Meier method.

PARAGRAPH

For the survival analysis, continuous variables were transformed into qualitative or ordinal variables according to ranges of normality for laboratory values, clinical relevance or the median value of the given parameter.

The event of interest was death for any cause: univariate analysis was performed for all the variables under study, and then multivariable analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model was used to explore the variables that showed a significant relationship with survival.

The proportionality assumption was verified by Schoenfeld residual analysis.

A prognostic score was then derived using the independent variables weighed according to the estimated β regression coefficient of the final Cox model.

The risk estimate associated with each point was then calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model.

Three prognostic categories were identified according to the changes in the risk estimates for each point increase of the score.

The OS curves, PFS curves and risk of liver decompensation were then obtained with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by means of log-rank test.

PARAGRAPH

All analyses were two-tailed and the threshold of significance was assessed at p <0.05.

The statistical analysis was performed using IBM® SPSS® Statistics, version 20.

Results

PARAGRAPH

A total of 148 patients meeting the inclusion criteria underwent 99Tc-MAA angioscintigraphy during the study period.

Of these patients, 28 (18.9%) did not undergo subsequent TARE for the following reasons: 15 patients (53.6%) because of low/absent accumulation of 99Tc-MAA in the tumor nodules, eight patients (28.6%) because of extrahepatic (gastrointestinal) accumulation of 99Tc-MAA and five patients (17.8%) because of lung shunting.

Finally, 120 patients were eligible for the study and received the TARE treatment.

Baseline characteristics are depicted (Table 1): overall, the median age was 64 years (IQR: 56–72), patients were mainly males (85.0%) and were predominantly classified as “fully active” (ECOG PS 0, 95.8%).

In the majority of cases (45.8%) hepatitis C virus was the etiology of liver disease; liver function was within CTP A in 93.3% of cases, median MELD score was 8 (IQR: 7–10) and ALBI grade was 1 and 2 in 51.7% and 47.5% of cases respectively.

Thirty-seven patients (30.8%) had undergone one or more sessions of TACE before TARE.

All patients were in the advanced stage according to the BCLC classification (BCLC-C): PVTT was extended to segmentary branches in 53 patients (PV1, 44.2%), to secondary order branches in 37 patients (PV2, 30.8%) and to first order branches in 30 patients (PV3, 25%).

In most cases HCC was infiltrative (84 patients, 70.0%) and multifocal (99 patients, 82.5%), with a median diameter of the largest lesion of 7.3 cm (IQR: 5.8–10.9).

The median administered activity of Y90 was 2.6 GBq (1.9–3.7) and the treatment planning method was 1, 2 and 3 in 18 (15%), 77 (64.2%) and 25 (20.8%) cases respectively.

SECTION

Survival analysis

PARAGRAPH

Thirty-day mortality after treatment was 0%.

Median follow-up was 27.0 months (95% CI: 9.98–44.02): during this time, 90 patients died, 77 patients showed tumor progression and 37 patients experienced at least one episode of liver decompensation.

Median OS was 14.1 months (95% CI: 10.7–17.5), and one- and three-year OS were 53.2% and 18.5% respectively (Fig. 1, panel A).

Median PFS was 6.5 months (95% CI: 3.8–9.2), and one- and three-year PFS were 35.2% and 0% respectively (Fig. 1, panel B).

The rate of liver decompensation was 10.8% at three months and 31.6% at six months.

PARAGRAPH

No patients in the present series underwent subsequent resection.

Only one patient (with PVTT type 1) underwent liver transplant after showing a sustained complete response one year after TARE.

He is alive and well after 24 months but his follow-up for this study was censored at the time of liver transplant.

PARAGRAPH

The first site of tumor progression was intrahepatic in 59 patients (76.6% of progressions): detectable in 11 patients in the TARE-treated lobe, while in 43 patients it was detectable upon the appearance of new nodules in the contralateral lobe.

In 18 patients (23.4% of progressions) the first site of progression was extrahepatic only (10 patients) or combined intrahepatic and extrahepatic (eight patients).

Treatment at progression entailed retreatment with TARE in 14 patients, sorafenib or second-line experimental systemic therapies in 25 patients, percutaneous ablation in three patients and best available care in the remaining 35 patients.

Such distribution was dependent on liver function status, as only 34 patients (44.1%) maintained a well-compensated Child A status at the time of post-TARE tumor progression.28

SECTION

Development of the prognostic classification

PARAGRAPH

The results of the univariate analysis on baseline patient characteristics are presented (Table 2).

PARAGRAPH

Those variables identified as significant at univariate analysis were fitted in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model: the only variables independently correlated with survival were bilirubin, PVTT grade and tumor burden at the time of TARE; the proportionality of hazard ratios for all levels of all prognostic factors was verified.

The beta coefficients were transformed into relative points as shown (Fig. 2).

The hazard function identified a clear-cut change in the hazard ratio at the sum of 2 points and >3 points.

Thus, three prognostic categories were identified: favourable prognosis (0 points), intermediate prognosis (2–3 points) and dismal prognosis (>3 points).

Median OS in the three categories was 32.2 months, 14.9 months and 7.8 months respectively (p <0.0001, Fig. 2).

Also PFS (p = 0.045) and risk of liver decompensation (p <0.0001) were significantly stratified according to the three proposed prognostic categories, as reported (Table 3).

Median PFS was 14.1 months (with a 42.1% three-year OS) in patients with normal bilirubin, limited tumor burden and PVTT limited to segmental branches (favourable prognostic group); conversely TARE in patients with more than one risk factor (>3 points) yielded a median PFS of 4.1 months, a risk of liver decompensation of 21.6% at three months and no survivors at three years.

Three cases of patients with HCC and different grades of PVTT (type 1, 2 and 3 respectively) are shown before and after TARE treatment (Fig. 3).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Despite consistent advances in the clinical management of HCC, the therapeutic options for patients with locally advanced disease because of PVTT are very limited.

PARAGRAPH

Radioembolization with Y90 has been recognized as a safe and effective treatment for unresectable HCC, as acknowledged in several guidelines.5,11,29

In several non-comparative studies17–21,30 published in the last decade on patients with HCC and PVTT, treatment with TARE has demonstrated an excellent safety profile, with median OS ranging from 10 to 13 months.

These survival outcomes appeared superior to those obtained with sorafenib7,8 and this has fuelled retrospective comparative studies31,32 and two RCTs comparing TARE and sorafenib in the setting of locally advanced HCC.

All these studies – although not specifically focused on the subset of patients with PVTT – failed to confirm a meaningful survival benefit provided by TARE with Y90 microsphere.22,23

PARAGRAPH

In this study we report the long-term outcomes of a consecutive series of patients with HCC and PVTT treated with TARE.

As shown, median and three-year OS were 14.1 months and 18.5% respectively (Fig. 1).

Overall, these results are superior to those previously reported by our group,21 and amongst the best reported in literature for patients offered such treatment outside clinical trials: this is probably related to the stringent application of refined selection criteria, derived from our previous experience.

In fact, in the present series, patients with PVTT were treated with TARE only in the presence of compensated liver function (within Child-Pugh A-B7 stage) and with no occlusion of the main portal trunk.

This also resulted in a 0% treatment-related mortality, and in an acceptable rate of liver decompensation at three months of 10.8%.

PARAGRAPH

Considering the resource impact of TARE in the current practice of HCC treatment, the main endpoint of our study was to identify the independent prognostic factors for OS in patients with HCC and PVTT treated with TARE and to assess whether or not different prognostic categories could correlate with predictable patient outcomes in advanced HCC maintaining sufficient liver function.

At multivariable analysis, only three variables (PVTT extension, tumor burden in terms of liver volume replacement and baseline serum total bilirubin) were found to have an independent impact on post-treatment survival.

PARAGRAPH

The extension of PVTT is known to directly affect patients prognosis: with respect to segmental invasion, thrombosis of more proximal branches increases the risk of tumor spread, and induces elevation of portal venous pressure causing higher risk of variceal hemorrhage, ascites, and liver failure.33

The influence of PVTT extension on post-treatment outcomes has been demonstrated in several series of HCC patients treated with TARE,21,33,34 but also in patients treated by means of radical surgical resection.35

Notably, patients with PVTT of the main portal vein were not treated at our center.

Based on the available literature in this setting,15,17,21 TARE provides a median OS of three to six months, seemingly not providing a meaningful survival benefit.

This is probably because PVTT of the main portal vein is vascularized by arterial feedings from the common hepatic artery, and thus out of reach for microspheres injected when performing lobar or selective treatments (through first or second order arterial branches).

PARAGRAPH

Tumoral burden replacing >50% of total liver volume also independently affected survival.

Not surprisingly, other morphological tumor variables (i.e. tumor size, number of nodules, presentation pattern) lost significance with respect to the overall tumor bulk, a common feature in the advanced stages of the disease.

Most likely this correlated with a reduced functional liver remnant and consequently a higher risk of early liver decompensation; moreover, excessive tumor load may impede an effective treatment by means of a single session of TARE, and liver dysfunction may precede re-treatments.

PARAGRAPH

Bilirubin was the only liver-related factor that showed an independent correlation with post-treatment survival.

Again, this was relatively expected because the study population was relatively homogeneous in terms of liver function, being 97.2% of patients in Child-Pugh A and having an ALBI grade <3 in 99.2% of cases.

Baseline bilirubin levels showed an independent influence on survival in other series of patients treated with TARE:19,20 higher bilirubin at baseline is a sign of liver dysfunction and a predisposing factor for post-treatment bilirubin toxicity, which is a common adverse event after TARE, particularly in patients with PVTT.17

PARAGRAPH

A distinctive feature of this study is the development of a prognostic score derived from the estimated β regression coefficients of the final Cox model for extension of PVTT, tumor burden and serum bilirubin values at the time of treatment.

According to the changes in risk estimates, three prognostic categories were identified that allowed a significant prognostic stratification in terms of OS, PFS and risk of liver decompensation at three months as shown (Fig. 2 and Table 3).

PARAGRAPH

In particular, patients with 0 points (absence of adverse prognostic factors) were those with a favorable prognosis.

These patients showed a median OS of 32.2 months and a median PFS of 14.1 months, with a negligible risk of TARE-related liver decompensation (3.2% after three months).

In fact, the favorable prognosis subgroup achieved a remarkable survival outcome that is comparable to unresectable HCC undergoing TACE in the absence of PVTT.36,37

This result indirectly suggests that patients with HCC, segmental PVTT and good liver function may be considered a sub-category of the intermediate stage HCC according to the BCLC classification.38

Thus, besides confirming that TARE may be considered as the first line treatment in this patient subgroup, the observed median PFS of 14.1 months may well justify consideration of TARE as a down-staging treatment for liver transplantation in selected patients with segmental PVTT.

PARAGRAPH

Patients expressing one of the aforementioned prognostic factors (2–3 points) can be considered a subgroup at intermediate prognosis.

In this category of patients TARE works with a palliative purpose, even though the observed median OS of 14.9 months remains definitively higher than that expected with a first line systemic therapy.

Considering the good tolerability of the treatment, and the acceptable risk of liver decompensation at three months (less than 10%), in field practice TARE can be proposed as a reasonable alternative to systemic treatments when the composite assessment of post-TARE prognosis turns out to be in the intermediate-risk category (Fig. 2).

PARAGRAPH

According to the results of our prospective series, the prognosis should be considered dismal in patients expressing more than one of the prognostic factors.

In this category median OS was 7.8 months, therefore the benefit was considerably inferior to that expected with systemic therapy.

Also, considering a risk of liver decompensation of 21.6% at three months, TARE for this patient subgroup may be futile and potentially harmful, and thus should be avoided.

PARAGRAPH

Our study has some limitations.

Tumor or PVTT absorbed doses were not specifically evaluated.

Garin et al., in a study focusing on the impact of tumor dose based on 99mTc MAA quantification, found that a predicted tumor dose >205 Gy and good PVTT targeting may significantly improve OS.39

In future studies, personalized dosimetry may be integrated into the proposed scoring system to further improve the prognostic prediction.

Although this is one of the largest cohorts of consecutive patients with PVTT treated with TARE, the retrospective nature of the study and the relatively small sample size obviously limits the strength of evidence.

In particular, the limited number of patients does not allow for a sensitivity analysis in order to evaluate the weight of the different components of the score within each prognostic category.

Secondly, the previously discussed implications of our prognostic stratification for treatment allocation are limited by the absence of a comparator.

Most likely, the true survival benefit provided (or not) by TARE in the different prognostic classes of patients with PVTT compared to systemic treatments should be investigated in specifically designed prospective comparative studies: a condition that recent RCTs on TARE combined or compared to sorafenib did not specifically address.

Finally, in this report the evaluation of radiological response to TARE was not specifically collected, because it was beyond the objectives of a study specifically focused on clinical outcomes and on pre-treatment prognostication of survival.

PARAGRAPH

Even considering these limitations, this study suggests that TARE is a safe and effective treatment for patients with HCC and PVTT.

In patients with good liver function and no invasion of the main portal trunk, PVTT extension, tumor bulk and bilirubin level have an independent influence on long-term outcomes.

The proposed score – easily determined on pre-treatment clinical variables – can help in the identification and selection of good candidates for the treatment, and conversely of those patients for whom TARE may be futile.
