ABSTRACT

TITLE

Anti-PD-1 blockade with nivolumab with and without therapeutic vaccination for virally suppressed chronic hepatitis B: A pilot study

PARAGRAPH

To evaluate the hypothesis that increasing T cell frequency and activity may provide durable control of hepatitis B virus (HBV), we administered nivolumab, a programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, with or without GS-4774, an HBV therapeutic vaccine, in virally suppressed patients with HBV e antigen (HBeAg)-negative chronic HBV.

PARAGRAPH

In a phase Ib study, patients received either a single dose of nivolumab at 0.1 mg/kg (n = 2) or 0.3 mg/kg (n = 12), or 40 yeast units of GS-4774 at baseline and week 4 and 0.3 mg/kg of nivolumab at week 4 (n = 10).

The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change in HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) 12 weeks after nivolumab.

Safety and immunologic changes were assessed through week 24.

PARAGRAPH

There were no grade 3 or 4 adverse events or serious adverse events.

All assessed patients retained T cell PD-1 receptor occupancy 6–12 weeks post-infusion, with a mean total across 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg cohorts of 76% (95% CI 75–77), and no significant differences were observed between cohorts (p = 0.839).

Patients receiving 0.3 mg/kg nivolumab without and with GS-4774 had mean declines of −0.30 (95% CI −0.46 to −0.14) and −0.16 (95% CI −0.33 to 0.01) log10 IU/ml, respectively.

Patients showed significant HBsAg declines from baseline (p = 0.035) with 3 patients experiencing declines of >0.5 log10 by the end of study.

One patient, whose HBsAg went from baseline 1,173 IU/ml to undetectable at week 20, experienced an alanine aminotransferase flare (grade 3) at week 4 that resolved by week 8 and was accompanied by a significant increase in peripheral HBsAg-specific T cells at week 24.

PARAGRAPH

In virally suppressed HBeAg-negative patients, checkpoint blockade was well-tolerated and led to HBsAg decline in most patients and sustained HBsAg loss in 1 patient.
