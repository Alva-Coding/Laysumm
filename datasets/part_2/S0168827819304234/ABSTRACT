ABSTRACT

TITLE

Genomic sequencing identifies WNK2 as a driver in hepatocellular carcinoma and a risk factor for early recurrence

PARAGRAPH

Early recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative resection is common.

However, the association between genetic mechanisms and early HCC recurrence, especially in Chinese patients, remains largely unknown.

PARAGRAPH

We performed whole-genome sequencing (49 cases), whole-exome sequencing (18 cases), and deep targeted sequencing (115 cases) on 182 primary HCC samples.

Focusing on WNK2, we used Sanger sequencing and qPCR to evaluate all the coding exons and copy numbers of that gene in an additional 554 HCC samples.

We also explored the functional effect and mechanism of WNK2 on tumor growth and metastasis.

PARAGRAPH

We identified 5 genes (WNK2, RUNX1T1, CTNNB1, TSC1, and TP53) harboring somatic mutations that correlated with early tumor recurrence after curative resection in 182 primary HCC samples.

Focusing on WNK2, the overall somatic mutation and copy number loss occurred in 5.3% (39/736) and 27.2% (200/736), respectively, of the total 736 HCC samples.

Both types of variation were associated with lower WNK2 protein levels, higher rates of early tumor recurrence, and shorter overall survival.

Biofunctional investigations revealed a tumor-suppressor role of WNK2: its inactivation led to ERK1/2 signaling activation in HCC cells, tumor-associated macrophage infiltration, and tumor growth and metastasis.

PARAGRAPH

Our results delineate genomic events that characterize Chinese HCCs and identify WNK2 as a driver of early HCC recurrence after curative resection.
