TITLE

Control of replication of hepatitis B and C virus improves patient and graft survival in kidney transplantation

PARAGRAPH

Previously, infections with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus led to poor outcomes in kidney transplant recipients.

However, the outcomes of kidney transplants in patients with viral suppression are as good as those for kidney transplants in non-infected patients.

Antiviral therapy should be systematically proposed to hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C-infected kidney transplant recipients or candidates to prevent the deleterious hepatic and extrahepatic impact of chronic viral replication.

Recent access to direct-acting antivirals in patients with hepatitis C virus and renal dysfunction provides exciting new opportunities.
