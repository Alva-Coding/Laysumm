ABSTRACT

TITLE

MMP2/MMP9-mediated CD100 shedding is crucial for inducing intrahepatic anti-HBV CD8 T cell responses and HBV clearance

PARAGRAPH

CD100 is constitutively expressed on T cells and can be cleaved from the cell surface by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) to become soluble CD100 (sCD100).

Both membrane-bound CD100 (mCD100) and sCD100 have important immune regulatory functions that promote immune cell activation and responses.

This study investigated the expression and role of mCD100 and sCD100 in regulating antiviral immune responses during HBV infection.

PARAGRAPH

mCD100 expression on T cells, sCD100 levels in the serum, and MMP expression in the liver and serum were analysed in patients with chronic HBV (CHB) and in HBV-replicating mice.

The ability of sCD100 to mediate antigen-presenting cell maturation, HBV-specific T cell activation, and HBV clearance were analysed in HBV-replicating mice and patients with CHB.

PARAGRAPH

Patients with CHB had higher mCD100 expression on T cells and lower serum sCD100 levels compared with healthy controls.

Therapeutic sCD100 treatment resulted in the activation of DCs and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, enhanced HBV-specific CD8 T cell responses, and accelerated HBV clearance, whereas blockade of its receptor CD72 attenuated the intrahepatic anti-HBV CD8 T cell response.

Together with MMP9, MMP2 mediated mCD100 shedding from the T cell surface.

Patients with CHB had significantly lower serum MMP2 levels, which positively correlated with serum sCD100 levels, compared with healthy controls.

Inhibition of MMP2/9 activity resulted in an attenuated anti-HBV T cell response and delayed HBV clearance in mice.

PARAGRAPH

MMP2/9-mediated sCD100 release has an important role in regulating intrahepatic anti-HBV CD8 T cell responses, thus mediating subsequent viral clearance during HBV infection.
