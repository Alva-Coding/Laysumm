TITLE

Chimeric liver transplantation reveals interspecific graft remodelling

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

The use of chimeric animals with organs compatible with specific patients in need of transplantation has the potential to solve the chronic lack of organ donors.

The idea of using animals as incubators of human tissue is becoming more and more realistic, especially with the recent observation that human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can lead to chimeras after injection into pig blastocysts.1

At this stage, the experiment was terminated before birth, and the contribution of human cells to the final chimeric pig embryos has remained low, but future studies are looking at replacing entire organs, as has been the case for various rodent combinations.1

PARAGRAPH

Organ generation (thymus and pancreas) has been achieved by complementing genetically-deficient mouse and rat blastocysts with pluripotent stem cells (PSCs).3,4

Going one step further, pancreatic islets isolated after complementing Pdx1−/− rat blastocysts with mouse PSCs could reverse diabetes after transplantation into mice.5

However, the procedure is limited by the fact that Pdx1 codes for the pancreatic parenchyma only, while the vascular tissue remains of host origin.

This aspect is of lesser impact when aiming at transplanting islets, but presents a significant challenge for solid organ transplantation.2,6

In addition, other organs such as the kidney or the liver develop under the control of multiple genes,7,8 which makes the creation of organs with pure recipient features even more challenging, in part because multiple tissue knockouts are often lethal at a very early embryonic stage.9,10

The first available solid organs generated by xenogeneic blastocyst complementation will therefore likely carry residual xenogeneic host tissues.2

PARAGRAPH

The transplantation of such ‘impure’ xenogeneic chimeric organs needs to be tested in order to explore their function, potential for post-transplant maturation (clearing xenogeneic cells), and long-term remodelling across species.

With this aim in mind, we worked with the liver because of its high regenerative potential,11 lower immunogenicity,12 and pivotal synthetic role.13–15

While waiting for consistent chimeric livers created by blastocyst complementation, we used immuno-compromised fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH)-deficient adult mice (Fah−/−/Rag2−/−/Il2rg−/−; FRG mice16) populated with rat hepatocytes as donors, and newly weaned rats as recipients.

Materials and methods

SECTION

Experimental design

PARAGRAPH

Transplantation of FRG mouse liver grafts (named ‘Chimeric’) into newly weaned female Lewis rats, with or without postoperative immunosuppression.

Control groups being Lewis rats transplanted either with C57Bl/6 mouse livers (named ‘Xeno’) or Lewis rat livers (named ‘Syn’).

SECTION

Step-by-step development of a reliable model of mouse-to-rat orthotopic liver transplantation

SECTION

Liver transplantation in newly weaned rats

PARAGRAPH

Depending on the strain and gender, adult rats weigh eight to ten times more than adult mice, and abdominal organs follow similar proportions.17–19

As a result, adult mouse liver grafts can only fit the body of newly weaned rats, and we first developed such an orthotopic liver transplantation model.

PARAGRAPH

We transplanted Lewis liver grafts into three-week old male Lewis rat recipients (n = 4), using a well-standardized liver transplantation technique.20

All recipients recovered from the procedure, but stopped gaining weight between postoperative day (POD) 21 and 28, and died by POD 35 (Fig. 1A), showing clinical signs of portal hypertension, including ascites, external haemorrhoids, and abdominal wall varices (Fig. 1B).

Suspecting that the problem was related to the anastomotic cuffs preventing an appropriate vena porta growth, a system of dynamic cuffs (Fig. 1C) was developed and tested (n = 4).

This time, all recipients could gain weight normally and survived for more than 20 months (they were sacrificed on POD 589 ± 1, Fig. 1A).

Necropsy confirmed the opening of the cuffs and harmonious vessel development (Fig. 1C).

In parallel, we transplanted Lewis liver grafts into three-week old female Lewis rats (n = 6) using standard cuffs in order to assess whether the naturally slower growth of female rats would allow for the use of simpler non-dynamic anastomoses.

All recipients survived and developed normally (Fig. 1A) to adulthood like non-transplanted littermates.

Six months after transplantation live dissection under anaesthesia revealed accessory anastomotic circuits between the pancreatic veins and the grafts’ vena porta (Fig. 1D).

Such neoangiogenesis was absent in male recipients, probably because of their faster growth.

For those reasons, we performed all subsequent experiments using female rat recipients.

SECTION

Suboptimal immunosuppression after mouse-to-rat liver transplantation

PARAGRAPH

In order to assess the use of chimeric liver grafts compared to pure xenogeneic ones, we developed a model of liver transplantation with sub-acute rejection.

We determined the minimum dose of immunosuppression needed to avoid early death after transplantation of BDF1xC57Bl/6 mouse liver grafts into Lewis rats (Fig. 1E).

Considering the absence of data with mouse-to-rat liver transplantation, we determined the type of immunosuppression according to the one used after allogeneic mismatched rat heart transplantation, with daily administration of 0.3, 0.6 or 1.2 mg/kg tacrolimus (FK506).21

At 0.3 mg/kg, rats died between POD 12 and 14 (n = 2).

At 0.6 mg/kg, they died between POD 19 and 25, but stopped gaining weight after POD 14 (data not shown).

By contrast, recipients at 1.2 mg/kg survived for >112 days (n = 4), despite clinical signs of tacrolimus overdose, including diarrhoea (appearing between POD 21 and 35, 4/4 recipients) and lower limb weakness (POD 70–110, 3/4 recipients).

They showed very mild rejection in the histology from day 112 (Banff score22 2–3, 4/4 recipients).

Based on these data, we selected suboptimal immunosuppression with 0.6 mg/kg of tacrolimus for further experiments.

SECTION

Mouse graft arterialisation impedes short-term survival

PARAGRAPH

Liver graft arterialisation is not necessary to achieve consistent survival after syngeneic orthotopic liver transplantation in mice20 and rats.23

We tested the effect of arterialisation in our model, and transplanted three C57Bl/6 mouse liver grafts into three-week old Lewis rats with the reconstruction of the hepatic artery.

All recipients died within 48 h, and excessive liver flow was the most likely cause of liver failure (adult mouse liver, despite matching the vessel calliper measurement of a three-week old rat liver, has 30–40% less parenchyma17,18).

Of note, we observed a spontaneous re-arterialisation in the non-originally arterialised grafts (Fig. 1F), likely explaining the absence of even mild ischemic cholangiopathy in the liver grafts.

All following experiments involved non-arterialised transplantations.

SECTION

Orthotopic liver transplantation technique

PARAGRAPH

Liver transplantations of three-week old rats were performed using the technique developed in our lab for mouse orthotopic liver transplantation.20

We introduced some key revisions in order to face the challenge of exponentially growing grafts: longer sutures for the suprahepatic vena cava (SHVC) anastomosis, dynamic cuff anastomoses of the vena porta (VP) and the infrahepatic vena cava (IVC), and longer graft vessels by extended dissection.

SECTION

Rat and mouse donor procedure

PARAGRAPH

Under isoflurane anaesthesia, we performed a subcostal incision, freed the liver from its ligaments, and removed the gallbladder (mouse only).

We isolated the infrahepatic inferior vena cava by dividing the right renal and adrenal veins between 10-0 ties.

In the mouse, we also divided the left renal and the two lumbar veins closest to the IVC in order to gain extra length.

We isolated the VP by dividing the gastrosplenic and the superior duodenopancreatic veins.

In the mouse, we also divided the inferior mesenteric and the inferior duodenopancreatic veins between 11-0 ties.

We divided the common hepatic artery between 7-0 ties (except for the few donors where it was preserved and dissected down to the aorta).

We also cut the common hepatic duct 2 mm distal from the convergence, and cannulated it with a 3 mm stent (stretched 26G venflon).

PARAGRAPH

We flushed the liver with Ringer’s lactate solution (5 ml 4 °C) through the VP.

The inferior vena cava, the VP and the SHVC were cut, and the liver removed.

With the liver immersed in cold saline, cuffs obtained from 17G and 16G venflons were secured to the VP and the IVC respectively.

In the few cases where the grafts were arterialised, a fused silica stent (360 µm  ×  150 µm, IDEX, Oak Harbor, USA) was inserted into the celiac trunk.

SECTION

Standard vs. dynamic cuffs

PARAGRAPH

Anastomotic cuffs are commonly used in rodent liver transplantation to speed-up VP and IVC anastomoses.24

They are short tubes with a small handle, carved out from ordinary venflons.

Graft vessels are inserted into the cuffs and their free end everted around them, forming a rigid system on which the recipient vessels can be secured with a single tie (avoiding time-consuming running sutures).

Standard cuffs have fixed calibres and do not allow for vessel expansion.

PARAGRAPH

Dynamic cuffs, specifically designed for the transplantation of rapidly growing rats, are split along the sagittal plane.

The two parts are held together by an absorbable 12-0 Vicryl tie.

Two weeks after transplantation the tie loses its strength and the cuff can split, allowing normal expansion of the vessel (Fig. 1C).

SECTION

Recipient procedure

PARAGRAPH

Under isoflurane anaesthesia, rats received intramuscular ceftriaxone (10 mg) and metronidazole (1 mg).

We performed a midline incision, and released the hepatic ligaments.

We prepared the vessels by dividing collateral veins, divided the proper hepatic artery between ties, and cut the common hepatic duct close to the liver.

We secured the Quick-Linker rings to the inferior vena cava and the portal vein as previously described.20

PARAGRAPH

After clamping and cutting all vessels, the recipient liver was removed, the new liver brought in the field, and an end-to-end anastomosis of the SHVC was performed using a 10-0 nylon tie20 with 12 to 14 passages for a better compliance of the anastomosis.

We used the Quick-Linker device for the inferior vena cava and portal vein anastomoses.20,25

The anastomosis of the hepatic artery (in the selected animals) was performed by inserting the free end of the fused silica stent into the distal part of the common hepatic artery of the recipient.

The common bile duct (CBD) was reconstructed on the 26G stent with simple ligatures.

The abdominal cavity was closed by 6-0 Prolene running sutures.

SECTION

Animals

PARAGRAPH

All animals were cared for according to the international guidelines on animal care, and ethical approval was obtained from the ethical committee at the University of Geneva and from the Geneva veterinary authorities (number GE/50/16).

PARAGRAPH

Lewis and Wistar rats, and C57Bl/6 mice were purchased from Janvier Labs (Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France).

BDF1 (C57Bl/6xDBA/2) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Italia (Calco, Italy).

Green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic Wistar rats were kindly provided by Prof J. Kiss (Geneva University, Switzerland).

FRG (C57Bl/6 Fah−/−Rag2−/−Il2rg−/−) mice repopulated with Lewis rat hepatocytes were produced at Yecuris (Portland, OR, USA).

All of them (with the exception of FRG mice, see below) were housed in open cages, with an enriched environment (Aspen Tapvei, Harjumaa, Estonia), under 12 h/12 h light/dark cycles.

Free access to water and standard chow (RM3 diet by Special Diet Services, Essex, UK) was granted.

After surgery, animals were kept in standard individual cages, with the same enrichment, and having free access to water, and food.

PARAGRAPH

The preliminary experiments assessing standard and dynamic anastomosis cuffs used male Lewis rats (47–60 g) as donors and recipients.

The subsequent transplantations used female rats (40–60 g) as recipients.

The mouse-to-rat liver transplantation experiment assessing the appropriate level of immunosuppression used male BDF1xC57Bl/6 mice (27–32 g) as donors.

PARAGRAPH

Male FRG (C57Bl/6 Fah−/−Rag2−/−Il2rg−/−) mice (23–31 g) were used as donors in the chimeric groups.

Half were repopulated with hepatocytes coming from wild-type (WT) young male Lewis rats, half with hepatocytes derived from EGFP transgenic male Lewis rats (LEW-Tg(CAG-EGFP)YsRrrc)26 purchased from RRRC (Columbia, MO, USA).

Male C57Bl/6 mice (26–31 g) were used as donors in the xenogeneic groups.

In addition, female donor Wistar rat livers (40–45 g) were transplanted into female Wistar-GFP rats (40–57 g) for the liver plasticity experiments.

PARAGRAPH

Further details regarding the donor/recipient combinations used in all experiments can be found (Table 1).

SECTION

Generation of mouse-rat chimeric liver

PARAGRAPH

FRG (C57Bl/6 Fah−/−Rag2−/−Il2rg−/−) mice16 are severely immunosuppressed, and lack Fah.

This metabolic defect leads to a deadly liver failure, unless they are kept on 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC).

NTBC withdrawal results in progressive hepatocellular apoptosis and exogeneic hepatocytes can competitively engraft and expand, repopulating the liver up to 95%.27

PARAGRAPH

At six weeks of age FRG knockout mice were preconditioned with urokinase-expressing adenovirus (Ad:uPA).41

Ad:uPA was diluted to 1.25E+9 plaque forming units (pfu)/100 μl in sterile 0.9% saline and filtered using a 0.45 μm membrane.

Each mouse was anesthetized using isoflurane and given 5E+8 pfu per gram of bodyweight via retro-orbital vein injection 24 h before transplantation.

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocyte isolation from EGFP transgenic Lewis rats was carried out with a collagenase perfusion method and low speed centrifugation.

The freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were centrifuged at 100g for 5 min at 4 °C, and then resuspended in HCM media (Lonza, Cat CC-3198).

The resuspended hepatocytes were diluted 1:1 in 0.4% trypan blue and the cell number and viability were determined using a haemocytometer.

Hepatocytes were centrifuged again at 100g for 5 min at 4 °C and reconstituted in HCM at 5E+6 viable cells/ml.

For cell injection, the mice were anesthetized using isoflurane, and each mouse received 5E+5 hepatocytes (100 µl of the cell suspension) by intrasplenic injection as previously described.28

The mice were then subjected to the standard NTBC withdrawal regimen as described in the “Yecuris Care and Handling documents for Transplantable FRG KO mice” (available at www.yecuris.com).

SECTION

Pre-retrieval care of FRG mice and assessment of liver chimerism

PARAGRAPH

Male FRG mice repopulated with male Lewis rat hepatocytes were sent from Portland (OR, USA) to Geneva (GE, Switzerland) on high-dose NTBC (16 mg/L).

Once they arrived, they were housed in a specific-pathogen-free area and kept on NTBC (8 mg/L in sterile dextrose 3% drinking water, supplemented with 640 mg/L sulphamethoxazole and 128 mg/L trimethoprim) until they reached their pre-shipment weight.

At that point, NTBC was withdrawn for 21 days, and mice were tested for the presence of rat albumin.

Mice reaching at least 50% of the control rat albumin in their plasma (9/13 in the first series, 5/11 in the second series) were used as liver donors during the following two weeks.

SECTION

Immunosuppression administration

PARAGRAPH

We gave intramuscular tacrolimus (Prograf 5 mg/ml, Astellas Pharma, Wallisellen, Switzerland) to the recipients just before laparotomy (0.3, 0.6, 1.2 mg/kg body weight, depending on the study group).

We administered half of this dose intramuscularly and implanted a 14-day osmotic pump (Alzet Pump model 1002, Durtec Corp., Cupertino, USA) with the original dosage on POD 1.

On POD 14 we replaced the osmotic pump, keeping the dosage calculated at POD 0.

On POD 28 we replaced the osmotic pump (Alzet Pump model 1002 or 2002), recalculating the dosage based on the actual weight.

From POD 28 until the end of the experiments we replaced the osmotic pumps every 14 days keeping the dosage calculated on POD 28.

The pumps were installed subcutaneously through a small incision (closed with separated prolene 6-0 sutures).

We changed the position of the pump at every replacement.

SECTION

Assessment of graft rejection

PARAGRAPH

Expert liver pathologists performed the liver graft rejection assessments in a blinded fashion.

The Banff rejection activity index is the gold standard in clinical practice.

It quantifies rejection by grading portal, bile ducts and venous endothelial inflammation.21

We used Banff index to score POD 7, 14, 28, 56, 112, and 168 surgical biopsy specimens.

Lobular inflammation was defined as a focus of two or more inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear neutrophils and eosinophils except microabscesses) within the lobule.

Foci were counted at 20× magnification (Score 0: none; Score 1: ≤2 foci per 20×; Score 2: >2 foci per 20×; Score 3: ≥5 foci per 20×).

SECTION

Plasma levels of albumin and tacrolimus

PARAGRAPH

Plasma concentration of rat and mouse albumin were measured using ELISA kits ab108789 and ab207620 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Tacrolimus plasmatic levels were measured using ELISA kit AMS.E1207Ge (AMS Biotechnology, Abingdon, UK), following standard manufacturer’s protocol.

SECTION

Flow cytometry analysis

PARAGRAPH

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were purified in a Ficoll density gradient (Ficoll-Paque Plus, GEHealthcare).

Isolated cells were incubated with Fc-blocking reagent (TrueStain, Biolegend) for 5 min, and subsequently stained for 20 min at 4 °C with a mix of the following antibodies: FITC anti-CD161 (10/78), PerCP anti-CD8 (OX-8), APC anti-TCR (R73), APCCy7 anti-CD4 (W3/25).

All samples were acquired with a Flow Cytometer Cyan (Beckman Coulter) and analysed with FloJo (Treestar).

SECTION

Immunofluorescence

PARAGRAPH

For the assessment of rejection, liver cryosections (5 µm) were acetone-fixed, saturated in DakoDiluent supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum and incubated with anti-NKR-P1 (CD161, 10/78) or anti-CD68 (ED-1) for a 2 h incubation.

After three washes, sections were incubated with Alexa555 goat anti-mouse IgG (Poly4053, Biolegend) for 1 h and mounted with SlowFade™ Gold Antifade Mountant DAPI (Invitrogen).

To assess liver remodelling, liver cryostections were paraformaldehyde-fixed, saturated and incubated with rabbit anti-GFP (Abcam ab6556) and incubated for 2 h with either mouse anti-SE-1 (Novus Biologicals), mouse anti-CD31 (3A12), mouse anti-CK19 (KRT19/800), mouse IgG1 isotype control (MG1-45) or goat anti-osteopontin (R&D Systems, AF808.

After three washes, sections were incubated with Alexa488 goat anti-rabbit Ig (A32731, Invitrogen) with Alexa555 goat anti-mouse IgG (Poly4053, Biolegend) or Alexa488 Donkey anti-rabbit (poly4064, biolegend) with Alexa555 donkey anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen A21432) for 1 h and mounted with SlowFade™ Gold Antifade Mountant DAPI (Invitrogen).

For some experiments, sections were incubated with goat anti-osteopontin, mouse anti-CK19 and rabbit anti-beta-catenin (Sigma-Aldrich, C2206).

After washes, sections were incubated with Alexa555 donkey anti-goat IgG, Alexa488 donkey anti-rabbit and Alexa647 donkey anti-mouse (Invitrogen, A31571).

SECTION

Immunohistochemistry and quantification of biliary chimerism

PARAGRAPH

Liver paraffin sections (5 µm) were dewaxed and heat-mediated antigen retrieval was performed (10 mM citrate buffer).

After permeabilization with Triton™ 0.5% and saturation with tris buffer saline solution supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween®, sections were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-FAH antibody (ab83770, Abcam) or rabbit anti-GFP (ab6556, Abcam).

The following day, biotinylated swine anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Dako E0353) were incubated for 1 h.

After an extensive wash, sections were incubated with HRP-streptavidin (Dako P0397) for 30 min and DAB substrate (D3939, Sigma) was added for 8 min.

Slides were rinsed in water and counterstained with haematoxylin.

Non-vascular ductular structures were counted and the GFP+ component was expressed as a percentage of the total.

SECTION

Statistical analyses

PARAGRAPH

Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 6 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA).

Survivals were plotted according to Kaplan-Meier and compared using Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.

All other data were compared using Mann-Whitney test.

The limit for statistical significance was set at p = 0.05.

Albumin was expressed as mean (range).

All other measures were expressed as median (range).

Results

SECTION

Improved survival and normal growth after transplantation of chimeric mouse livers into rats

PARAGRAPH

Without immunosuppression, all recipients of xenogeneic and chimeric liver grafts died between POD 5 and 11 (Fig. 2B).

Histology showed massive cellular rejection in both groups, with Banff scores of 9 for the surviving recipients on POD 7 (data not shown).

PARAGRAPH

In a second set of experiments, recipients received suboptimal immunosuppression (0.6 mg/kg/day tacrolimus) for 56 days.

The chimeric liver recipients survived while on immunosuppression, but died 24 to 77 days after immunosuppression was stopped (POD 80 to 133).

By contrast, xenogeneic controls showed impaired growth (Xeno IS vs. Chimeric IS p = 0.0002) and died significantly earlier (Xeno IS vs. Chimeric IS p = 0.0014, Fig. 2C).

PARAGRAPH

In order to confirm that the rats transplanted with chimeric livers could survive until adulthood, we repeated the experiment and doubled the length of immunosuppression (112 days).

Again, all chimeric liver recipients survived and grew at the same rate as syngeneic controls, while the xenogeneic controls died significantly earlier (Xeno IS vs. Chimeric IS p = 0.0014, Fig. 2D).

PARAGRAPH

The observed differences in survival were linked to rejection.

Rats receiving full xenogeneic livers showed moderate to severe rejection on all biopsies (median Banff score ≥5 at POD 14, 28 and 56, Fig. 3A).

Conversely, the recipients of chimeric livers did not experience moderate rejection until POD 56 (median Banff score always <5).

Lobular inflammation was also lower in the chimeric recipients (Fig. 2A).

Of note, the recipients of chimeric livers demonstrated more rejection on POD 112 (Banff 8–9).

However, lobular inflammation remained milder in comparison to the xenogeneic recipients at earlier time points, suggesting that chimeric recipients were still healthy despite severe periportal inflammation.

PARAGRAPH

These results were not linked to differing levels of tacrolimus between groups (Fig. 3B).

In fact, the effect of immunosuppression looked similar between groups with reduced levels of circulating T lymphocytes.

Tacrolimus also acts to reduce the activity of natural killer (NK) cells, without significantly affecting their proliferation.29

We found confirmation of this phenomenon in the blood of the syngeneic controls, where NK cells had normal absolute ranges (data not shown), but represented a consistent part of the mononuclear cells (Fig. 3C).

By contrast, xenogeneic and chimeric recipients showed lower levels of circulating NK cells.

This observation was linked to an increased presence of NK cells in the xenogeneic and chimeric grafts compared to their syngeneic counterparts (Fig. 3D).

Chimeric mouse liver remodelling and growth after transplantation into rats

SECTION

Autologous hepatocytes replace xenogeneic hepatocytes after transplantation

PARAGRAPH

At the time of procurement, the chimeric mouse livers repopulated with rat hepatocytes were still harbouring enough functional mouse hepatocytes to reach normal plasma levels for mouse albumin (Fig. 4A).

Mouse albumin was present in transplanted rats until POD 28, but decreased over the time and became undetectable by POD 56.

This observation matched the full replacement of xenogeneic hepatocytes (FAH−) by autologous hepatocytes (FAH+) seen starting at POD 56 on histology (Fig. 4B).

Rat albumin plasmatic levels were similar between recipients of chimeric and syngeneic liver grafts (Fig. 4C).

Of note, none of the recipients was kept on NTBC.

SECTION

The hepatocyte pool is reconstituted by resident liver cells only

PARAGRAPH

After transplantation into newly weaned rats, chimeric and xenogeneic livers grew in a similar manner (liver weight: from 2.0 (1.7–2.2) g and 1.3 (1.1–1.4) g respectively at procurement to 9.6 (8.8–10.1) g and 10.0 (9.9–11.1) g respectively at POD 112.

Fig. 5A).

In case of severe and prolonged liver damage, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells play a role in liver regeneration,30 and in the FAH−/− model, myelomonocyte-hepatocyte fusion contributes to replacing the deficient hepatocytes.31

In order to assess the origin of liver cells after transplantation, we first analysed the fate of syngeneic WT Wistar rat liver grafts transplanted into newly weaned Wistar rats carrying a ubiquitous green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene.

Immunohistochemistry targeting GFP on the biopsies performed every two weeks showed that only macrophages were of recipient origin (Fig. 5B).

This finding demonstrates that only resident liver cells contribute to the post-transplant liver growth in a syngeneic model.

PARAGRAPH

We repeated the experiments in a xenogeneic model, transplanting WT C57Bl/6 mouse liver grafts under high-dose immunosuppression (tacrolimus 1.2 mg/kg) into newly weaned GFP Wistar rats.

Despite the presence of GFP+ inflammatory infiltrates (mild rejection, Banff score 2–3) and perisinusoidal macrophages, no other recipient-derived cells were detected (Fig. 5C).

This suggests that only resident liver cells contribute to the post-transplant liver growth even in a xenogeneic model.

PARAGRAPH

With this background in mind, we analysed the biopsies taken from the chimeric groups.

The rat hepatocytes in the chimeric livers were designed to be GFP+ and FAH+, the cells derived from the rat recipients were GFP− and FAH+, and mouse liver cells were GFP− and FAH−.

On POD 112, all hepatocytes expressed both GFP and FAH, again suggesting that liver parenchymal regeneration was carried out by resident cells only (previously implanted rat hepatocytes, Fig. 5D).

SECTION

The mature cholangiocyte pool is reconstituted by resident liver cells

PARAGRAPH

Chimeric livers, once transplanted under suboptimal immunosuppression, were subject to chronic inflammation due to mild to moderate rejection against mouse tissue.

Immunohistochemistry performed on liver graft biopsies at POD 56 and 112 showed that almost all ductal cells were GFP+ (rat origin) in the areas of ductal hyperproliferation (Fig. 6A, B).

Smaller GFP+ ductuli also expressed osteopontin (OPN), confirming that they originated from hepatocytes in a chronically inflamed environment32–34 (Fig. 5C).

Larger GFP+ ductuli expressed cytokeratin 19 (CK19) (Fig. 5D).

However, in contrast to previous reports none of the CK19+ cells simultaneously expressed OPN, suggesting that they were the result of complete transdifferentiation of hepatocytes into mature cholangiocytes (Fig. 6E).

This process was more evident in the peripheral areas of the grafts (31–72% ductular structures were GFP+), while central areas (close to hilum or main vascular branches) were less involved (3–26% ductular structures were GFP+).

SECTION

The portal endothelium is partially reconstituted by xenogeneic cells from the host

PARAGRAPH

We investigated whether endothelial remodelling was coming from recipient or donor cells, utilizing an antibody specifically directed against rat hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (SE-1) and a highly specific CD31 antibody for rat portal endothelium.

Both antibodies are rat specific and the absence of labelling was assessed on control mouse liver sections.

We found no rat SE-1+ sinusoidal endothelial cells between POD 7 and 112 after xenogeneic and chimeric transplantations (data not shown).

However, we identified rat CD31+ portal endothelium in selected POD 112 samples (1/5 recipients, <10% of rat endothelium) after chimeric transplantation (Fig. 7A).

None of the rat CD31+ cells in the chimeric grafts were GFP+ (Fig. 7A), suggesting recipient origin.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The present work leads to a number of innovative observations, including: (i) xenogeneic mouse-to-rat liver transplantation can be performed and leads to long-term survival under full immunosuppression, (ii) mouse livers repopulated with rat hepatocytes and transplanted into rats leads to long-term survival under suboptimal immunosuppression, (iii) chimeric liver grafts undergo recipient-oriented remodelling of hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, and, in a more subtle manner, of endothelial cells after transplantation, (iv) hepatocyte and cholangiocyte remodelling originates from donor cells, and (v) liver size is not limited to its original size in the donor.

PARAGRAPH

We demonstrate that orthotopic transplantation of a mouse liver into a rat is possible, and allows for long-term survival under high-dose immunosuppression.

This result was obtained at the price of chronic signs of tacrolimus-related side-effects (including diarrhoea and lower extremity weakness), which limited the observation to 112 days.

We would have likely extended survival with the use of multiple molecules at lower dosages; however, this was beyond the scope of the present study.

PARAGRAPH

We further show that xenogeneic (chimeric) mouse liver grafts repopulated with autologous rat hepatocytes lead to long-term survival after transplantation in rats with the use of suboptimal immunosuppression only.

The improved survival and rejection profile (Banff ≤5, lobular infiltrate ≤1 until POD 56) are related to the replacement of the hepatocytes by autologous cells, resulting in a reduced antigenic load.35

Of interest, the recipients of chimeric liver grafts also gained weight in a more physiological manner than the recipients of xenogeneic grafts, which may be related to the milder rejection, but also to the production of autologous proteins adapted to rat homeostasis.

Of note, a previous study had already shown that similarly engineered chimeric mouse liver grafts could survive in rats for several weeks under strong dual immunosuppression.36

However, their function could not be assessed because they were transplanted in a heterotopic position, and the rats own livers were kept in place.

PARAGRAPH

We conducted the present study between mice and rats, two species that are phylogenetically close.

Therefore, one would still need to validate the data between species that are more distant.

To illustrate, the outcome of pig islet-to-non-human primate xenotransplantation is affected by the interspecific differences in the blood glucose level able to trigger beta-cell activation.37

In addition, albumin levels are similar between mice and rats, but this would not be the case between more phylogenetically distant species, like pigs and humans.2

Altogether, the use of chimeric livers will always offer an advantage over the use of classical xenotransplantation, thanks to the production of autologous proteins tailored for the recipient.

PARAGRAPH

Similar to previous reports based on models with chronic liver insult,32,33 we confirm that mature rat hepatocytes are able to undergo ductular metaplasia.

We found abundant OPN+ ductular cells in the chimeric livers starting from POD 28, when rejection and lobular inflammation were still mild.

By contrast, this phenomenon was extremely rare in the xenogeneic grafts until POD 56 (data not shown) and absent in the later biopsies.

We hypothesize that the stronger xenogeneic rejection blocks transdifferentiation, while the immunological advantage of the autologous hepatocytes in chimeric livers promotes their proliferation and even complete transdifferentiation to mature cholangiocytes (GFP+ CK19+ OPN− cells) when needed.

Moreover, complete transdifferentiation of mature hepatocytes into mature cholangiocytes has recently been demonstrated (beyond any doubt), in a murine model of bile duct agenesis.38

The regenerative potential of the liver is known.

Segments of an adult human liver transplanted into an infant can grow ten times their original size in 15–20 years.39,40

In the present model, mouse liver grafts (both chimeric and xenogeneic) grew up to 8.6 times their original size, and grew more than the rat control grafts (Fig. 4A).

This observation is likely related to the 20%41,42 higher portal pressure in rats compared to mice, driving strong haemodynamic signals.

This observation shows the potential of developing liver grafts in smaller and easier to breed animals in view of a potential paediatric application.

PARAGRAPH

The present data represent a step towards a potential clinical application, which will require managing more phylogenetically distant species with stronger humoral rejection against all endothelia.

However, we proved that relatively impure livers undergo intense post-implantation remodelling towards recipient features, including the portal endothelium which was 100% xenogeneic in the pre-implantation chimeric grafts and partially replaced by rat cells (from the recipient) some weeks after transplantation.

In this light, replacing the majority of the xenogeneic endothelia before transplantation – as theoretically achievable by blastocyst complementation – may not be completely necessary, since the initial autologous component will likely repopulate the rest of the graft after implantation.

Alternatively, one could also explore the use of genetically modified Fah knockout pigs to overcome complement mediated rejection.2

Ultimately, one must still validate the concept in large animal models, ideally using non-human primates.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, our work demonstrates the efficacy of transplanting a chimeric solid organ into a xenogeneic species, a further step towards validation in higher species and patient-tailored organ generation for transplantation.
