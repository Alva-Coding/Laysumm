TITLE

Radiation-primed hepatocyte transplantation in murine monogeneic dyslipidemia normalizes cholesterol and prevents atherosclerosis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Lipid homeostasis requires the uptake of chylomicron remnants and other lipoprotein particles by hepatocytes via binding of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and apolipoprotein B-100 (ApoB-100) lipoprotein ligands to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) family.1

Inherited loss-of-function mutations in the LDLR, gain-of-function mutations in PCSK9 or ApoB-100 and/or ApoE deficiency all lead to familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) with elevated levels of plasma LDL cholesterol, the main cause of atherosclerotic disease.1–6

PARAGRAPH

Until statin treatment became available, mortality rates of patients with heterozygous FH aged 20–29 were up to 125 times greater than in a comparable healthy demographic.7

After statins, the mean age of death for homozygous FH increased by almost 14 years to 31.7, and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) decreased by 10.0–26.4%.1,8

PCSK9 inhibitors that increase cell surface LDLR levels are highly potent in LDL-C reduction but are ineffective in the absence of ApoE or LDLR.

Other novel treatments such as lipoprotein apheresis and mipomersen (an anti-sense oligonucleotide for ApoB mRNA) are important advances but not ideal for long-term clinical use due to high cost (apheresis: ∼$100,000 per year, requires weekly procedures).9

Liver transplantation restores normal lipid metabolism as it restores the entire metabolic pathway for cholesterol but this treatment is limited by the shortage in donor organs, cost, and the need for lifelong immunosuppression.10,11

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocyte transplantation (HT) has been investigated as a substitute for liver transplantation to restore hepatic function.

It is minimally-invasive, cost-effective and with the advent of induced-pluripotent cell (iPSC) technologies, could potentially enable autografts without the need for immunosuppression.12,13

Treatment of LDLR or ApoE deficiency would require a significant mass of transplanted hepatocytes to achieve curative levels of metabolic restoration.

However, only a fraction of transplanted hepatocytes undergo initial engraftment and subsequent liver repopulation (proliferation within the liver parenchyma).

We therefore developed a preparative regimen of hepatic irradiation (HIR) to transiently disrupt the endothelial barrier, inactivate Kupffer cells and reduce the mitotic potential of resident hepatocytes in order to enhance engraftment and give transplanted cells a proliferative advantage.14,15

In addition, proof-of-concept studies demonstrated that mitogenic stimuli such as partial hepatectomy or adenoviral expression of HGF were essential for efficient liver repopulation by successfully engrafted cells.12,16,17

Recently, clinical trials have been initiated to test the efficacy of HIR alone for the treatment of metabolic disease (NCT01345565, NCT01465100), but mitotic stimulation was not given due to a lack of clinically suitable reagents.18

Here we demonstrate that HIR and HT followed by a single 3-week course of GC-1 (sobetirome), a selective thyroid hormone receptor β (TRβ)-agonist,19 support curative levels of repopulation in an ApoE-deficient mouse model of human homozygous monogeneic hypercholesterolemia, resulting in a reduction of serum cholesterol levels to normal or near normal levels.

Strikingly, a reduction of atherogenic lipoprotein particles completely prevented atherosclerosis in these mice.

Materials and methods

SECTION

Animals

PARAGRAPH

Nine to 10-week-old male and female ApoE−/− mice were purchased from JAX (#002052).

Animals were weighed every 2 weeks and serum was collected 4 weeks after treatment and every 2 weeks thereafter.

Mice were housed in the Institute for Animal Studies at Albert Einstein College of medicine (AECOM) in a temperature-controlled room under a 12/12 h dark / light cycle and fed standard, irradiated chow (PicoLab Mouse Diet 20 5058) on an ad libitum basis.

All experiments were performed according to protocols approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at AECOM.

Experiments were performed on the following groups, and were independently repeated: Untreated control (n = 10, male), HIR only (n = 5, male), GC-1 only (n = 9, male), HTHIR (n = 13, male), HTGC-1 (n = 8, male), HTHIR+GC-1 (n = 15, male), HTHIR+AdHGF (n = 5, male).

For the HIR dose escalation study, HIR 20 Gy (n = 3, male and female), HIR 30 Gy (n = 5, male and female), HIR 40 Gy (n = 5, male and female), HIR 50 Gy (n = 4, male and female).

SECTION

AdHGF formulation and administration

PARAGRAPH

5 × 106 particles of AdHGF (Genetic Engineering and Gene Therapy Core of AECOM) were injected into the tail vein 24–48 h post transplantation.

SECTION

Hepatocyte isolation and transplant

PARAGRAPH

Primary hepatocytes were isolated at the AECOM Cell Therapy Core from C57/Bl6 male mice 10–12 weeks old using collagenase perfusion as previously described.21

Only cell isolations with >90% viability were used for HT.

Individual treatment groups of max n = 5 were transplanted per day.

Hepatocytes were diluted to 107 cells/ml in phenol-free DMEM and kept on ice for max 1 h until transplanted.

Cells were gently mixed, drawn into an uncapped plastic syringe (to minimize shearing) which was then capped with a 27 G needle.

A total of 100 μl (106 hepatocytes) was transplanted into the spleen of healthy adult mice anesthetized with isoflurane.

Buprenorphine was given post-operatively as an analgesic.

SECTION

Hepatic irradiation

PARAGRAPH

A total of 50 Gy irradiation was administered to the median and superior right lobe of the liver using cone-beam CT-guided imaging in a small animal radiation research platform (xStrahl SARRP).

Results

SECTION

Non-invasive preparative HIR is well tolerated in ApoE−/− mice

PARAGRAPH

To develop a well-tolerated method of conformal HIR, we designed a non-invasive image-guided radiation treatment using cone-beam CT for treatment planning to deliver 50 Gy HIR via 2 rotating arcs to the upper left lateral region of the median lobe and upper right lobe, totaling approximately 30% of the total liver volume liver (Fig. 1A, C).

This method creates a steep dose drop-off which reduces the probability of radiation-induced liver damage and toxicity to surrounding organs, such as the stomach, small intestine, kidney, heart, lungs, and spine (Fig. 1A,B).

PARAGRAPH

Radiation-induced gastrointestinal syndrome (RIGS) is a potentially lethal acute adverse effect of abdominal irradiation with death between 7–14 days.22

To assess the possibility of RIGS, we treated ApoE−/− mice of both genders with escalating doses (20–50 Gy) of HIR but all irradiated animals survived to day 21, well past the occurrence of RIGS.

Furthermore, necropsy at day 21 showed no bleeding, constriction or ulceration of the GI tract (Fig. S1).

Together these results demonstrated that our external-beam conformal HIR avoid off-target irradiation of the GI tract.

PARAGRAPH

Atherogenic mice have been shown to have increased sensitivity to irradiation but histological markers of atherosclerosis were absent in the irradiated livers of ApoE−/− mice (Fig. 2B).23–26

A small number of animals were lost over the course of the experiment without any apparent cause of death and we performed necropsy on all animals to examine possible off-target toxicity (Fig. 2B, C).

The lung and pancreas were within normal histologic limits while the kidney showed mild to moderate multifocal subcapsular and cortical interstitial fibrosis, consistent with minor radiation-induced fibrosis.

Kidney function was assessed using blood urea nitrogen and remained within normal limits over the course of the experiment (Fig. 2D).

SECTION

GC-1 is an effective and well tolerated hepatic mitogen

PARAGRAPH

Previous studies have established that thyroid hormone, T3, is a hepatic mitogen but prolonged administration induces severe cardiac arrhythmia.27–30

In contrast, the synthetic T3 mimetic GC-1, a thyroid hormone receptor β (TR-β) selective agonist, is a similarly strong hepatic mitogen but has no impact on cardiac function.31,32

To verify the mitogenic effect of GC-1, we first tested its effects on primary hepatocytes in vitro and found increased proliferation compared to controls (Fig. S2Α).

This proliferative effect was abrogated by H89, a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, or NH3, a TR-antagonist (Fig. S2Α).

GC-1 also led to increased Cyclin D1 levels at 3 h post treatment to the same extent as T3 hormone (Fig. S2Β).

Together, these results suggest that the mitogenic effects of T3 and GC-1 are identical; induction of TR-β signaling leading to β-catenin phosphorylation by PKA resulting in Cyclin D1 upregulation and proliferation.31,32

PARAGRAPH

We confirmed the mitogenic effect of GC-1 on hepatocyte proliferation in vivo on C57/Bl6 mice, treated with various combinations of HIR, HT and GC-1, using BrdU incorporation as a measure of proliferation (Fig. 3).

In our study, about 5% of cells are actively cycling at any given time in normal liver, that fraction increases to about 15% after GC-1 administration.

As expected, HIR suppressed hepatic proliferation to 1–3%, even after GC-1 or HT alone.

In contrast, when hepatocytes were transplanted after HIR+GC-1, the proliferative index rose to about 15% in the liver (Fig. 3B,C).

SECTION

Preparative HIR+GC-1 significantly reduces serum cholesterol after HT

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocytes were transplanted intrasplenically into ApoE−/− mice, 24 h post HIR followed by 21 consecutive daily doses of GC-1.

Blood plasma was collected pre-treatment and at intervals post treatment to determine total cholesterol, LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides (Fig. 3A).

As expected from the known cholesterol-lowering effect of GC-1,33,34 all groups receiving GC-1 had an ∼10% reduction in total cholesterol over the course of the treatment but only mice receiving HT+HIR and either AdHGF or GC-1 showed a continuous and sustained reduction in cholesterol and triglyceride levels to normal or near normal levels over the 12 week study period (Fig. 4A).

The plasma of ApoE−/− mice was turbid before treatment because of high very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicron content but became clear 12 weeks after treatment in the HTHIR+GC-1 group (Fig. 4B).

Interestingly, serum cholesterol levels decreased faster with GC-1 as a hepatic mitogen compared to AdHGF (Fig. 4, and Fig. S3) while control groups receiving GC-1 or HTGC-1 alone exhibited a transient reduction of cholesterol levels.

A control group receiving HTHIR but no mitogen showed no improvement (Fig. 4A and Fig. S3).

PARAGRAPH

Fast-protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) fractionation was performed to analyze plasma lipoprotein particle composition before and after treatment and cholesterol reduction.

In wild-type (WT) mice, cholesterol circulates predominantly as HDL particles, whereas the significantly increased cholesterol levels in ApoE−/− circulate mostly as VLDL particles.35

As expected, the vast majority of cholesterol in age and sex-matched control C57/Bl6 mice (∼80%) was present as HDL particles (55.73 mg/dl) and only minor amounts as LDL and VLDL particles (11.24 mg/dl and 2.93 mg/dl respectively) (Fig. 4C).

In contrast, the cholesterol in ApoE−/− mice was distributed in all 3 particle categories with a 40-fold increase in VLDL and 10-fold increase in LDL fractions compared with to WT mice: VLDL-124 mg/dl, LDL-123.6 mg/dl (Fig. 4C).

HDL levels in ApoE−/− mice were only increased by about 30% (HDL-78.8 mg/dl).

Sixteen weeks after HT in the HTHIR+GC1 group, hypercholesteremia in the ApoE−/− mice was resolved to near normal levels (Fig. 4A) and, remarkably, plasma cholesterol particle distribution shifted to a pattern highly similar to WT mice: VLDL (10.6 mg/dl, 92% reduction), LDL (23.8 mg/dl, 81% reduction) and HDL (52.31 mg/dl) (Fig. 4C).

This clearly demonstrates that HTHIR+GC1 cures hypercholesterolemia through reduction in VLDL, LDL and to a lesser extent, HDL particles, consistent with the role of ApoE as an LDLR ligand present in VLDL and LDL, but not HDL particles.

Six months after treatment, total serum cholesterol in the HTHIR+GC1 treated mice was 87 ± 23 mg/dl while that of controls continued to be elevated ∼400 mg/dl (Fig. S3E).

SECTION

ApoE detection in circulation starting at 4 weeks in animals given HTHIR+GC1

PARAGRAPH

ApoE was detectable in serum by western blot 4 weeks post treatment in mice receiving HTHIR+AdHGF or GC-1, with levels increasing at week 4 and reaching steady-state levels at week 6 (Fig. 4D) with significant cholesterol reduction occurring between week 4–6.

Serum ApoE concentrations were higher in the HTHIR+GC1 group compared to the HTHIR+AdHGF group, paralleling the greater cholesterol reduction observed in the HTHIR+GC1 group (Fig. 4A).

Importantly, although ApoE concentrations in the HTHIR+GC1 group at 12 weeks were still significantly lower compared to WT mice, cholesterol levels were still normalized (Fig. 4A, D) suggesting that the threshold concentration of ApoE required for cholesterol homeostasis is significantly lower than normal concentrations.

SECTION

Robust engraftment and repopulation of transplanted hepatocytes in animals given HTHIR+mitogen

PARAGRAPH

Animals were sacrificed 12 weeks post treatment and liver tissue was analyzed for repopulation by ApoE immunostaining.

In animals receiving HTHIR or HTGC-1, only a few ApoE+ cells were detected as single cells or 2-cell clusters.

(Fig. 5A, middle panels).

In contrast, mice receiving the full treatment protocol (HTHIR+AdHGF or HTHIR+GC-1) had large clusters of ApoE+ cells containing up to 1,000 cells per colony/section restricted to irradiated liver parenchyma, demonstrating HIR dependent robust proliferation of transplanted hepatocytes (Fig. 5A, bottom panels, Fig. S4).

Quantitative image analysis shows 10% to 40% ApoE+ within the irradiated liver volume (Fig. 5B).

Cell number and cluster size in the AdHGF group were overall smaller compared to GC-1 treated animals, likely due to faster turnover and/or lower levels of HGF vs. the 21-day administration of GC-1.

These results correlate with the greater cholesterol reduction and ApoE plasma concentration noted in the HTHIR+GC-1 group (Fig. 4).

At 24 weeks post treatment, control groups still showed scant engraftment of 1–2 cells (data not shown), while irradiated liver lobes of HTHIR+GC-1 treated animals showed near total repopulation (Fig. S4D-E).

SECTION

No α-ApoE antibodies or liver inflammation were detected in transplanted animals

PARAGRAPH

ApoE secreted by transplanted hepatocytes could be potentially recognized as a foreign protein in ApoE null mice.

We therefore tested for humoral immune response against ApoE, as well as cell-mediated rejection of the transplanted cells.

Western blot showed no detectable antibodies against α-ApoE in sera of mice irrespective of degree of repopulation (Fig. S5A, B).

In addition, there were no histological signs of transplant rejection in control or transplanted HTHIR+GC-1 liver tissue (Fig. 6).

SECTION

Cholesterol reduction prevents formation of atherosclerotic plaques

PARAGRAPH

Cholesterol levels have a strong correlation with atherosclerosis and early mortality in patients with monogeneic dyslipidemias.36

ApoE−/− mice begin to develop fatty streaks in the abdominal aorta at 12 weeks of age35 and invasive atherosclerotic lesions around 5–8 months and we wanted to determine if reduction of cholesterol levels by our liver repopulation protocols had an effect on this process in ApoE−/− mice.

Histological analysis of the thoracic aorta in untreated control mice 12 weeks post treatment showed early signs of atherosclerosis, including lesions containing foam cells, granulocytes, necrotic core lesions, and fibrous caps but such lesions were completely absent in HTHIR+GC-1 treated mice (Fig. 7A).

Sixteen weeks after treatment, control mice had large, pronounced atherosclerotic plaques with subendothelial accumulation of foamy macrophages, smooth muscle cells hypertrophy, and occasional mineralization of the vessel wall were detected in the aortic arch of untreated mice while only a few, small plaques were seen in the HTHIR+GC-1 treated group (Fig. 7B).

At 24 weeks post treatment, untreated mice had large aortic plaques, thickening of the coronary vessel walls with foam cells, pronounced atherosclerotic accumulations and thickening around the aortic valve (Fig. 7C), consistent with previous reports on ApoE−/− mice fed standard chow or high-fat diet.37

Remarkably, these features were fully absent in the HTHIR+GC-1 group (Fig. 7D) demonstrating that our transplant protocol and associated cholesterol reduction was able to completely resolve atherosclerosis in these mice.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The standard treatment for inherited hypercholesterolemias is daily administration of pharmaceutical agents for the lifetime of the patient.

Even with maximum dose therapy, therapeutic guidelines are often not met, and even when they are, the risk of developing early cardiovascular disease remains substantial.38

Liver transplantation is a curative treatment option, but its use is limited by cost, shortage of donor organs and the need for lifelong immunosuppression.

In addition, maintaining immune suppressive medication compliance over a lifetime is difficult for adults and in children it is only about 50%.39

Thus, a single treatment with lasting results would be ideal for long-term cholesterol reduction and atherosclerosis prevention.

PARAGRAPH

In the present study, we have demonstrated complete restoration of serum cholesterol metabolism and atherosclerosis prevention in a murine model of a homozygous monogeneic hypercholesterolemia, the ApoE-deficient mouse.

ApoE expression was restored to therapeutic levels by a single HT procedure coupled with a well-tolerated preparative regimen consisting of targeted, non-invasive conformal HIR to a part of the liver mass and a post-transplantation 3-week course of GC-1 administration, resulting in substantial liver repopulation by the transplanted cells.

PARAGRAPH

Premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death in patients with inherited hypercholesterolemia.

Atherosclerosis is a progressive process dependent on an inflammatory cascade at a primary lesion caused by subintimal cholesterol deposition.40

Early diagnosis, and rapid, consistent treatment is essential for long-term control of atherosclerosis and in young patients with inherited dyslipidemias it would be ideal to prevent the development of atherosclerosis altogether.1,6,41

In this study, cholesterol reduction starting at 4–6 weeks after treatment prevented the formation of early atherosclerotic plaques as well as progression of atherosclerosis in the aorta, the aortic valve, and occlusive changes in the coronary vasculature.

PARAGRAPH

We sought to develop and test a therapeutic regimen of HIR, HT and hepatic mitogen towards a clinical application by minimizing off-target side-effects and toxicity.

In previous studies of preparative HIR, the liver was irradiated after it was exposed with all non-target areas shielded.17

That technique provided a proof-of-concept of the safety and efficacy of preparative partial HIR for HT in an invasive procedure.

We therefore evaluated the efficacy and potential toxicities associated with non-invasive external-beam HIR techniques that are currently in clinical use.

Liver irradiation requires careful treatment planning due to the radiosensitivity of the liver and adjacent GI tract.

We demonstrate that treatment planning targeting approximately 30% of the liver volume using external-beam irradiation is both well tolerated and sufficiently voluminous to allow therapeutic levels of liver repopulation with subsequent reversal of the disease phenotype without off-target effects.

In particular, radiation-induced atherosclerosis is more likely to form in irradiated tissue of patients with high atherosclerotic propensity and can cause premature vascular disease but no atherosclerotic features were detected in irradiated liver tissue in this study.23,24,26

However, care should be taken to minimize the radiation dose to muscular arteries, such as the hepatic artery and the renal arteries that are prone to atherosclerosis in any future clinical applications.

PARAGRAPH

We and others have shown that proliferative stimulation is essential for effective liver repopulation but so far sufficiently safe options for clinical use have not been demonstrated.12,16,17,42,43

Partial hepatectomy or adenoviral expression of HGF, although efficient, is not suitable for clinical use.

In one study, partial hepatectomy was tolerated in 2 patients with Crigler-Najjar.44

However, it is a highly invasive surgery subject to significant risks and complications.

Recombinant HGF is unstable and expensive and viral expression of HGF is biologically hazardous.45,46

Additional safety concerns exist regarding the clinical use of HGF such as serious negative effects on cardiac function and broad and unpredictable tissue effects.47,48

The thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3), is a known hepatic mitogen and has been reported to stimulate proliferation of hepatocytes transplanted into the liver of rats pretreated with the plant alkaloid retrorsine.28,49

However, the required effective dose produced severe tachycardia by direct action of T3 on TRα the T3 receptor dominant in cardiac tissue, which can cause lethal arrythmias.

In contrast, GC-1, an FDA approved T3 mimetic, is selective for TRβ, which is preferentially expressed in the liver, with an affinity that is equal to that of endogenous triiodothyronine, whereas its affinity to TRα1 is 10-fold lower.19

Therefore, because GC-1 functions as a hepatic mitogen without impacting cardiac function, we evaluated whether it could provide the required proliferative stimuli for transplanted hepatocytes without causing tachycardia associated with thyrotoxicosis.19,32

Notably, we did not find any evidence of hepatotoxicity in mice treated with GC-1 in our study, consistent with reports of extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing.50

GC-1 is currently an investigational drug and there is also an ongoing trial on the use of GC-1 for the treatment of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (NCT03196765) which will further improve our understanding of its potential clinical use and safety.

PARAGRAPH

Besides its role as a hepatic mitogen, GC-1 also has inherent lipid-lowering activity of its own, making it especially attractive in the context of dyslipidemia treatment.33,34

Although we consistently observed some cholesterol reduction during the GC-1 administration period in all groups, a pronounced and sustained hypocholesterolemic effect was only seen at the 12- and 24-week end points when combined with HIR and HT.

The combined HTHIR+GC-1 treatment led to detectable plasma ApoE levels within 4 weeks of treatment and significant reduction of serum cholesterol at 6 weeks.

At the 12 week time point, the extent of liver repopulation in the irradiated area of the liver was similar to other studies utilizing preparative HIR in other metabolic disease models such as the UGT1A1-deficient jaundiced Gunn rat and Agxt-deficient mouse model of primary hyperoxaluria type 1.42,51

In a recent study, iPSC-derived hepatocytes were transplanted into immunodeficient Ldlr−/− mice with 3 Gy preparative HIR but without mitogenic stimulation.52

The comparatively low repopulation reported in that study could have resulted from an HIR dose that was insufficient to reduce the mitotic potential of the host hepatocytes adequately, a lack of mitotic stimulation or both.

This highlights the importance of an optimized regimen combining a sufficiently high radiation dose with mitotic stimulation of transplanted cells.

PARAGRAPH

A recent report of a set of HT clinical trials emphasizes the importance of allograft rejection monitoring, as graft loss will negate any therapeutic benefits.18

Although we used congeneic WT donors, the results could still be potentially affected by an immune response against ApoE being recognized as a non-self-antigen by the recipient immune system.

However, our assessment of histopathological markers of graft rejection within areas showing repopulation and the tests for antibodies against ApoE showed no evidence of this which could be explained by immune tolerance, which is often induced toward non-self proteins expressed in the liver.53

PARAGRAPH

In summary, our results show that HT coupled with preparative conformal external-beam HIR and a short course of GC-1 administration results in long-term cure of hypercholesterolemia in ApoE −/− mice, preventing the development of atherosclerosis.

Importantly, to our knowledge, this is the first report of curative HT in a liver-based metabolic disease model, in which each component of the regimen is well tolerated.

Although the recipient mice in our study did not exhibit any significant toxicity, for future clinical application, it will be necessary to assess possible thyroid toxicity, and radiation injury of the liver and large arteries, and to monitor graft immunoreactivity.
