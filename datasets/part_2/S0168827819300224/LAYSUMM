TITLE

Radiation-primed hepatocyte transplantation in murine monogeneic dyslipidemia normalizes cholesterol and prevents atherosclerosis

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocyte transplantation is a promising alternative to liver transplantation for the treatment of liver diseases.

However, it is inefficient, as restricted growth of transplanted cells in the liver limits its therapeutic benefits.

Preparative treatments improve the efficiency of this procedure, but no clinically-feasible options are currently available.

In this study we develop a novel well-tolerated preparative treatment to improve growth of cells in the liver and then demonstrate that this treatment completely cures an inherited lipid disorder in a mouse model.
