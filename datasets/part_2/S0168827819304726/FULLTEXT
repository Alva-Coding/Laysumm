TITLE

Impact of combined selective internal radiation therapy and sorafenib on survival in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of malignant primary liver tumour, accounting for 80–90% of all liver cancers.1

In the USA, for example, 30,640 new liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancers are estimated to have occurred in 2013, with 21,670 associated deaths.2,3

PARAGRAPH

Only about 30% of patients are diagnosed early enough to benefit from potentially curative therapies, such as surgical resection, allogeneic liver transplantation or percutaneous ablation, which afford 5-year survival rates of 50–75%.4

PARAGRAPH

For patients with inoperable (liver-confined) intermediate stage HCC, locoregional treatment by transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is the recommended treatment of choice in treatment guidelines.5–10

However, this recommendation is based on 2 randomised trials, with strict patient selection criteria, and the survival benefits were limited to patients with preserved liver function and limited tumour size and numbers.6,7

Systemic therapy with sorafenib (Nexavar®; Bayer Healthcare, Leverkusen, Germany) has been shown to provide a survival benefit and is standard of care for patients with HCC with preserved liver function in advanced disease stages; including those with portal vein invasion, lymph node or distant metastases, or altered performance status.5,11,12

PARAGRAPH

Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT; also known as radioembolisation) has been evaluated in a number of non-randomised trials with both yttrium-90 (90Y) resin microspheres (SIR-Spheres®, Sirtex Medical Ltd, Sydney, Australia) and 90Y glass microspheres (TheraSphere, BTG, London, UK) and has been shown to be effective and well tolerated in patients with unresectable HCC.13,14

SIRT appears to have similar efficacy to TACE for the cohort of ideal candidates for locoregional therapy, and encouraging results have been reported for patients who are poor candidates for TACE or have failed TACE.13–17

In 2 randomised trials, SARAH and SIRveNIB in patients with locally advanced HCC, SIRT with 90Y-resin microspheres failed to meet the primary endpoint of improving survival over sorafenib.

Tolerability seemed to be favourable for radioembolisation.18,19

PARAGRAPH

SORAfenib in combination with local MICro-therapy guided by gadolinium-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI (SORAMIC) (EudraCT 2009-012576-27, NCT0112 6645) is a prospective study that comprised 3 sub-studies: (i) comparison of gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (gadoxetate disodium [Gd-EOB-DTPA] Primovist®)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) vs. contrast-enhanced multislice computed tomography (CT) for the stratification of patients to a local ablation (curative treatment) or palliative treatment group; (ii) comparison of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) plus sorafenib vs. control (RFA plus matching placebo) on time to recurrence; and (iii) comparison of SIRT with 90Y resin microspheres combined with sorafenib compared with control (sorafenib alone) on overall survival (OS).

PARAGRAPH

This paper reports on the outcomes of part iii (the palliative treatment group), which was designed to determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of combining SIRT with sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC.

SECTION

Patients and methods

PARAGRAPH

SORAMIC is a prospective, phase II, open label, multicentre, randomised controlled trial.

The study was conducted at 38 sites in 12 countries in Europe, and Turkey.

SECTION

Ethical considerations

PARAGRAPH

The study was approved by the institutional review boards of all participating centres prior to initiation of the trial.

Before entering the study, all patients were fully informed by the treating physician of the scope and the goals of the trial, had given written informed consent, and were willing to comply with the study protocol.

SECTION

Study objectives

PARAGRAPH

SORAMIC was comprised of 3 parts.

In the palliative treatment sub-study, which is reported here, the primary objective was to determine if the combination of SIRT with 90Y resin microspheres plus sorafenib improved OS compared with sorafenib alone in patients with advanced HCC.

Secondary endpoints included the safety of the combination of SIRT + sorafenib therapy in comparison to sorafenib therapy alone, as well as OS in the subgroups of patients with and without portal thrombosis.

SECTION

Study design and procedure

SECTION

Screening stage

PARAGRAPH

Patients with a diagnosis of HCC received gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI and contrast-enhanced CT.

PARAGRAPH

Disease stage criteria was determined by the local investigator using all available clinical information including gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI and contrast-enhanced CT.

Based on the disease stage the local investigator determined the treatment strategy with curative intention (local ablation) or with palliative treatment resided with the responsible treating physicians at the study sites.

SECTION

Patient selection

PARAGRAPH

Patients with HCC Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages A, B, and C and Child-Pugh scores A to B7 were eligible for inclusion.

Key selection criteria for the palliative treatment group were BCLC B (not eligible for TACE per investigator decision) and C; prior resection or local/locoregional treatments were permitted.

Patients who had received prior TACE or TAE were included only after an interval of 3 months and if revascularisation was present.

Extrahepatic disease was permitted if patients displayed liver-dominant disease and did not present with pulmonary metastases.

PARAGRAPH

Key exclusion criteria in the palliative arm were a hepato-pulmonary shunt leading to an estimated lung dose >30 Gy; previous external beam radiation therapy to the liver, or previous therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Patients were also excluded if presenting with serum bilirubin more than 1.5x the upper limit of the normal range.

SECTION

Randomisation and masking

PARAGRAPH

Following a predefined randomisation plan, patients eligible for the palliative treatment group were randomised 11:10 to the SIRT + sorafenib or sorafenib arm.

The 11:10 ratio was chosen to account for patients lost in the combination arm for technical ineligibility of SIRT, assuming an equal patient number as result.

Randomisation was performed employing an IVRS.

Randomisation and stratification were carried out by centre and separately for patients with and without portal vein thrombosis.

SECTION

SIRt

PARAGRAPH

SIRT was performed after exclusion of relevant hepato-pulmonary shunts using 99mTc-labeled macroaggregated albumin (MAA) and after exclusion of relevant risk of microsphere misplacement in extrahepatic organs as recommended by the manufacturer.

SIRT with 90Y-resin microspheres was administered separately to each liver lobe; using a selective segmental approach, when appropriate.

To patients with bilobar disease, SIRT was initially performed on the dominant diseased liver lobe, followed 4–6 weeks later by SIRT to the untreated contralateral lobe.

When the patient’s disease was limited to a single lobe, only selective SIRT in a single session was performed.

Details of the dosimetry calculation can be found in the supplementary materials (S2).

PARAGRAPH

Patients who were randomised to receive SIRT, but for whom SIRT could not be performed for technical reasons or due to pulmonary lung shunting, remained in the study, but were switched to the sorafenib only arm.

SECTION

Sorafenib

PARAGRAPH

All patients in the palliative group were to receive sorafenib with a target dose of 400 mg twice daily (BID).

Patients in the sorafenib only arm received their treatment after randomisation.

In patients in the SIRT + sorafenib arm, sorafenib was initiated on day 3 after the last SIRT procedure.

In both treatment arms, patients received sorafenib 200 mg twice daily for 1 week before increasing the dose to 400 mg BID.

PARAGRAPH

Sorafenib treatment was continued until tumour progression or the emergence of drug-related AEs which required discontinuation, following 2 dose reductions (to 400 mg once daily, then to 400 mg on alternate days).

SECTION

Assessments

PARAGRAPH

Patients were assessed at 2-month intervals for a minimum of 24 months or until death.

At each visit, all treatment-emergent AEs were recorded and standard laboratory investigations (complete blood count, chemistry and coagulation panel and urinalysis) completed.

PARAGRAPH

Patients who discontinued sorafenib because of AEs were asked to continue in the study for ongoing assessment of long-term safety and OS.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

The statistical analysis of the palliative treatment group employed 3 data sets.

The safety analysis set included all patients that received treatment, analysing them as treated, independent of any randomisation errors.

This data set was used for the safety analysis.

The intention-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of all patients undergoing randomisation.

The ITT population was used for demographics as well as for the primary efficacy analysis of the palliative treatment arm.

The per protocol (PP) set comprised a subset of the ITT that excluded patients with major protocol deviations, such as no or incomplete study treatment.

The PP set was used as a secondary analysis set to assess efficacy in the palliative treatment group.

PARAGRAPH

For the palliative study, group-sequential methods were used, planning for 2 interim analyses and a final data analysis after one-third, two-thirds and all of the planned number of deaths (events) had been reported.

The necessary sample size was determined employing the log-rank test at a 1-sided type I error of 2.5%, a power of 80%, and an O’Brien-Fleming boundary, as specified using the Lan-DeMets type I error spending function (East-5, Cytel Software Corporation, Cambridge, MA).

Patient accrual was targeted to be 75 individuals for the first year and 150 thereafter.

The yearly dropout rate was assumed to be 10% for the SIRT + sorafenib group and 20% for the sorafenib only group.

The median survival was assumed to be 15.4 months for SIRT + sorafenib and 10.7 months for sorafenib.

A sample size of 375 patients was planned, with interim efficacy analyses to be performed after 80 and 160 reported deaths, and the nominal critical points for these interim analyses (and p values) being 3.710 (p <0.0001) and 2.511 (p = 0.006).

The final analysis was to be performed after 240 reported deaths with a nominal critical point of 1.993 (p = 0.0231).

PARAGRAPH

OS as the primary endpoint was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method (product-limit method) to compute non-parametric estimates of the survivor functions.

Right censoring was taken into account.

The survival curves were compared between both treatment groups with the log-rank test at specified error level α (one-sided tests).

The stratifying factor “portal vein thrombosis” (yes vs. no) was taken into account in the Cox proportional model.

PARAGRAPH

Interim analyses were planned and performed after 80 and 160 reported deaths.

The final analysis was to be performed after 240 reported deaths with a nominal critical point of 1.993 (p = 0.0231).

H0palliative: OSSIRT+sorafenib = OSsorafenib

was tested with the predefined one-sided alpha against

H1palliative : OSSIRT+sorafenib > OSsorafenib

PARAGRAPH

Superiority of SIRT + sorafenib could be concluded when the one-sided log-rank test was significant.

Only the primary parameter was compared at α = 2.31%.

All subgroup analyses and other study testing were considered exploratory with α = 5%.

PARAGRAPH

All safety analyses were performed by study group and treatment arm.

Descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) were calculated for each quantitative variable; frequency counts by category were made for each qualitative variable.

PARAGRAPH

The frequencies of AEs, as well as number of patients with AEs, were reported by study group and treatment arm.

Results were tabulated by body systems, severity categorised according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0), seriousness, causal relationship to study drug or device, causal relationship to study conduct, and outcome of the AE.

Any withdrawals from the study due to AEs were reported.

SECTION

Subgroup analyses

PARAGRAPH

All subgroup analyses were regarded as exploratory.

In the palliative treatment group, the following subgroup analyses were pre-planned in the statistical analysis plan: age (≤65 years, >65 years); sex (male, female); portal vein thrombosis (yes, no); Child-Pugh score 5, 6, 7; BCLC stage B vs. C; cirrhosis (present, not present); alcoholic aetiology (yes, no); hepatitis B (yes, no); hepatitis C (yes, no); extrahepatic metastasis (yes, no); liver dominant (yes, no); ECOG (0 vs. 1 vs. 2); albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade (1 vs. 2 vs. 3); pre-treatment (naïve vs. TACE vs. other); alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (high vs. low); tumour load (high vs. low); tumour load inside/outside-up-to-seven (the sum of the number of tumours and the diameter of the largest tumour); hepatoma arterial-embolisation prognostic (HAP) score (0,1,2,3).

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

Patients were recruited into SORAMIC between 5 January 2011 and 19 April 2016, and 424 were allocated to the palliative treatment cohort.

In the ITT palliative treatment cohort, 216 patients were randomised to SIRT + sorafenib and 208 to sorafenib alone.

The PP population comprised 114 patients randomised to SIRT + sorafenib and 174 who received sorafenib alone.

The safety population comprised 159 patients who received SIRT + sorafenib, 182 who received sorafenib alone, and initially 24 and 15 patients randomised to SIRT + sorafenib but who received only SIRT or only sorafenib (Fig. 1.

In those patients receiving only SIRT, the reasons for failing to receive sorafenib were: withdrawal of consent, 3; clinical decompensation (anorexia, tumour progression, liver function), 13; non-liver-disease related medical causes (myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism), 3; lost to follow-up before sorafenib initiation, 5).

PARAGRAPH

Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarised in Table 1.

There were no significant differences between the treatment groups in either the ITT or PP populations.

Patients’ previous treatment for HCC is summarised in Table 2.

PARAGRAPH

Treatment received is summarised in Table 3.

In the combination arm, the median time to start the first SIRT treatment after randomisation was 22 days (IQR 12).

The median time to start sorafenib after SIRT completion was 3 days (IQR 3).

In the sorafenib only arm, the median time to start sorafenib was 4 days (IQR 6).

After randomisation patients were followed for a median of 9.4 months (IQR 12.6) in the SIRT + sorafenib group and 6.57 months (IQR 11.1) in the sorafenib group.

Sixteen out of 159 patients and 27 out of 197 patients who received SIRT + sorafenib or sorafenib monotherapy (including those 15 randomised to SIRT + sorafenib, but who received sorafenib only) underwent systemic second-line treatments after study completion, often as part of subsequent clinical trials (p = 0.29; Table S3).

SECTION

Efficacy

PARAGRAPH

Median OS in the ITT population was 12.1 months (95% CI 10.7–14.9) in the SIRT + sorafenib arm, and 11.4 months (95% CI 9.9–14.0) in the sorafenib arm (hazard ratio [HR] 1.01; 95% CI 0.81–1.25; p = 0.953; Fig. 2A).

In the PP population, median OS was 14.0 months (95% CI 11.5–17.0) in the SIRT + sorafenib arm (n = 174), and 11.1 months (95% CI 9.8–13.8) in the sorafenib arm (n = 174; HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.67–1.11; p = 0.252; Fig. 2B).

PARAGRAPH

Subgroup analyses of the PP population (Fig. 3) suggested a survival benefit for patients receiving SIRT + sorafenib vs. sorafenib alone in: patients ≤65 years (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.43–1.00; p = 0.046); non-cirrhotic patients (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.25–0.86); p = 0.013), and patients with HCC of non-alcoholic aetiology (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.45–0.89); p = 0.009) (Fig. 4A–C).

PARAGRAPH

Patients with no previous TACE had a median survival of 14.0 months in the SIRT + sorafenib arm vs. 11.0 months in the sorafenib arm (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.61–1.10), whereas in patients with previous TACE, median survival was 13.3 and 13.4 months, respectively (HR 1.0; 0.6–1.64).

In patients displaying a tumour load >7 tumours, median survival in the SIRT + sorafenib arm was 14.5 months vs. 10.5 months in the sorafenib arm (HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.60–1.07) (Fig. 4D, E).

SECTION

Adverse events

PARAGRAPH

AEs of CTCAE Grade 3–4 were reported in 103/159 (64.8%) patients in the SIRT + sorafenib arm and in 97/182 (53.3%) patients who received sorafenib only, with the difference reaching statistical significance (p = 0.036) (Table 4).

PARAGRAPH

Among the most frequent AEs, hyperbilirubinaemia was approximately 3-fold more common in the SIRT + sorafenib arm than in the sorafenib arm (14.5% vs. 4.4%).

Fatigue was significantly more common in the SIRT + sorafenib arm than in the sorafenib arm with 35.2% vs. 24.2% of patients, respectively (Table S1).

PARAGRAPH

Treatment-related Grade 5 AEs occurred in 2 patients (1.3%) in the SIRT + sorafenib group, in 2 patients (1.0%) who received sorafenib alone, and in 1 patient randomised to SIRT + sorafenib who received only SIRT (Table 4 and Table S4).

Two deaths were considered to be AEs of interest: 1 case of decreased appetite in the sorafenib group and 1 case of radiation pneumonitis in the SIRT group (because of overexposure beyond the proposed 30 Gy limit due to a technical failure), and 1 case of liver failure in a patient receiving SIRT only.

The other 2 deaths were recorded as due to hepatic encephalopathy and as a surgical complication of pulmonary thromboembolectomy.

PARAGRAPH

Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 63 (39.6%) patients in the SIRT + sorafenib arm and 70 (70.5%) patients who received sorafenib only.

Hepatic failure as an SAE was reported in 6 patients (3.8%) in the SIRT + sorafenib arm and 8 patients (4.1%) in the sorafenib arm.

Hepatobiliary SAEs considered to be serious and treatment related are summarised in Table 5.

PARAGRAPH

Among AEs of particular interest, Grade 3–4 hand foot syndrome was reported in 15/159 (9.4%) patients in the SIRT + sorafenib arm, and in 17/182 (9.3%) patients who received sorafenib alone (Table 5).

A Grade 3–4 duodenal or gastric ulcer was reported in 2 patients (1.3%) in the SIRT + sorafenib arm.

Grade 3–4 gastrointestinal bleeding/haemorrhage occurred in 6 patients (3.8%) in the SIRT + sorafenib arm, in 5 patients (2.5%) in the sorafenib arm, and in 1 patient (4.2%) who received only SIRT.

Ascites was the most frequently reported Grade 3–4 hepatic AE, occurring in 6 patients (3.8%) in the SIRT + sorafenib group and in 13 patients (6.6%) who received sorafenib alone.

Grade 3–4 liver dysfunction/failure occurred in 1 patient each in the SIRT + sorafenib arm, in patients who received sorafenib only and in patients who received only SIRT.

A case of Grade 3–4 radiation hepatitis was reported in 1 patient who received only SIRT (Table 5).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

SORAMIC is the first large randomised controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of combining SIRT and systemic therapy for the palliative treatment of unresectable HCC not suitable for TACE.

PARAGRAPH

In the overall study population, the addition of SIRT to sorafenib did not result in a significant improvement in OS compared with sorafenib alone.

However, subgroup analyses of the PP population led to hypothesis-generating results for patient groups with potential clinical benefit from adding SIRT: non-cirrhotic patients, younger patients (≤65 years) and patients presenting with HCC of non-alcoholic aetiology.

PARAGRAPH

As expected, due to their non-overlapping toxicity profile, a higher proportion of patients in the SIRT + sorafenib arm experienced Grade 3–4 AEs than in the sorafenib arm.

However, the number of patients who experienced treatment-related Grade 5 events was low, and similar in the treatment arms.

Observed toxicities were in accordance with published experiences with sorafenib and 90Y-resin microspheres.

PARAGRAPH

The potential of demonstrating a significant benefit in OS, with the addition of SIRT, may have been diminished by the high proportion of patients (47.2%) who did not receive SIRT per ITT or were excluded from the analysis due to protocol deviations.

In the total PP cohort of patients receiving SIRT + sorafenib or sorafenib alone, without major protocol deviations, median survival was 14.0 months vs. 11.1 months, respectively.

However statistical significance was not reached in part as a result of the limited number of patients (114 vs. 174, HR 0.86).

PARAGRAPH

Suboptimal SIRT in some patients may also lie behind the lack of benefit in the combination arm.

Dosimetry in SIRT is a subject of ongoing debate.

Studies have indicated that achieving a threshold dose, by 90Y microsphere uptake into the tumour, leads to better remission rates and may even improve survival.20

However, the higher the dose, the more likely it is that significant parenchymal deposition of microspheres will occur, which is potentially harmful to liver function on a subclinical level and could lead to liver decompensation weeks or months after treatment.

A high tumour to liver uptake ratio is likely to be crucial for treatment outcomes.

PARAGRAPH

We hypothesise that a dominant factor in failing to demonstrate a therapeutic benefit from the addition of SIRT to sorafenib in this study was the recruitment of much too broad a patient population, particularly through including patients with compromised liver function.

The results of 2 head-to-head comparisons of SIRT vs. sorafenib have demonstrated improved tumour control with SIRT compared with sorafenib, but no survival benefits.18,19

In SARAH, the cumulative incidence of progression in the liver was significantly lower with SIRT compared with sorafenib (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.56–0.93; p = 0.0143), but the cumulative incidence of death was significantly higher with SIRT compared with sorafenib (p = 0.0265).

In SIRT, a certain dose of radiation is delivered to the non-tumoural liver compartment.

Radiation may produce tissue damage, including sinusoidal congestion similar to venous occlusive disease, which is potentially accessible for medical prevention.21

When such damage is intense, liver decompensation may occur.

SIRT-associated radiation-induced liver disease was defined as a bilirubin increase associated with symptomatic ascites, occurring up to 3 months post-SIRT;22 it may even occur after lobar SIRT in cirrhotic patients.23

However, among patients with HCC at various stages of cirrhosis and liver dysfunction, these signs and symptoms are difficult to discriminate from the natural course of cirrhosis and it would be very difficult to identify more subtle negative effects on liver function with uncertain prognostic impact.

PARAGRAPH

The pre-planned PP analyses of the SORAMIC trial identified several subgroups that could potentially benefit, in terms of survival, from the combined use of SIRT and sorafenib, including non-cirrhotic patients (HR 0.43), or those with non-alcoholic aetiology (HR 0.63), who are known to be functionally more stable than individuals with cirrhosis or alcoholic aetiology.24

Similarly, in patients who had not previously received TACE, survival in the SIRT + sorafenib arm was longer than in the sorafenib arm, 14.0 vs. 11.0 months (HR 0.82); these patients are more likely to present with preserved liver function than patients who have received TACE.

Patients in the SIRT + sorafenib arm with diffuse or very large tumours outside up-to-seven (in whom the relative dose of radiation delivered to the liver is likely lower), with Child-Pugh score ≤6 and no previous TACE, showed a trend towards improved survival compared to equivalent patients in the sorafenib arm (14.5 vs. 10.5 months, HR 0.76, p = 0.1; Fig. S3).

However, SIRT + sorafenib did not confer a survival benefit in patients with a Child-Pugh score ≤6, who were not outside up-to-seven and who had previously received TACE (15.2 vs. 12.9, HR 1.01, p = 0.99) (Fig. S3).

PARAGRAPH

We hypothesise that the potential benefit of the combination occurred specifically in patients with a better functional liver reserve, in whom the non-tumoural liver was less exposed to radiation.

In this population, the subclinical effects of radiation would have minimal or no impact on long-term patient outcome.

Although Child-Pugh score at inclusion (A5 vs. A6 vs. B7) did not influence survival, we observed a correlation between a higher Child-Pugh score and an increase in protocol deviations in the SIRT + sorafenib arm, mostly missing a second SIRT procedure and/or missing the induction of sorafenib treatment.

In the SIRT + sorafenib arm, major protocol deviations occurred in 41%, 50% and 66%, of patients with Child-Pugh scores of 5, 6 and 7, respectively, while in the sorafenib arm they were evenly distributed (15%, 14%, and 13%, respectively; p <0.05).

PARAGRAPH

Our study did not demonstrate a benefit from adding SIRT to systemic treatment in advanced tumours, in the ITT or PP populations.

These results are in line with previous head-to-head comparisons of 90Y SIRT against sorafenib, the SARAH and the SIRveNIB trials, which both demonstrated similar survival in patients with very advanced disease, but were not powered to demonstrate non-inferiority.18,19

We hypothesise, based on our exploratory subgroup analyses, that these studies recruited from too broad a patient population, including patients with compromised liver function, to demonstrate survival benefits from SIRT.

PARAGRAPH

Our study was limited by the high proportion of patients (47.2%) who did not receive the allocated treatment or received the allocated treatment, but were excluded from the PP analysis because of major protocol deviations.

Large numbers of protocol deviations were also observed in the SIRT arms of the SIRT monotherapy trials (26.5% of patients in SARAH and 28.5% in SIRveNIB).8,19

In SORAMIC, we applied the exclusion criteria rigorously, i.e. excluding any patient receiving inappropriate doses or with a delayed start to systemic therapy after SIRT.

We believe that the high number of protocol deviations reflects the challenges of an interdisciplinary clinical routine across Europe today.

Several factors hinder interdisciplinary communication among physicians, at times leading to delays of scheduling, loss of information, and suboptimal patient guidance, all of which are determinant of harmonious combination of an interventional procedure and drug treatment.

Accordingly, we propose that the outcome in this PP population is highly representative of what could be expected in optimal clinical practice.

PARAGRAPH

Our study provides a sound basis for future clinical development of SIRT in intermediate to advanced HCC.

Future randomised controlled trials should target less advanced disease with uncompromised liver functional reserve.

Favourable outcomes with SIRT have been reported in a retrospective study in a cohort of patients at the BCLC B2 stage, a substage of BCLC B, displaying tumours outside-up-to-seven and preserved liver function Child-Pugh score A.25,26 This is of particular interest since TACE has failed to demonstrate efficacy in large and multiple tumours at BCLC stage B.7,26,27 The role of dosimetry should be considered, whereby only those patients that may receive a significant amount of radiation to the tumour compartment with minimal exposure of the non-tumoural compartment deserve prospective investigation of SIRT in future trials.

PARAGRAPH

In SORAMIC, the addition of SIRT to sorafenib did not result in a significant improvement in OS compared with sorafenib alone.

Grade 3–4 AEs were significantly more common in the SIRT + sorafenib arm.

Subgroup analyses led to hypothesis-generating results for patient groups in which combination therapy has potential clinical benefit.
