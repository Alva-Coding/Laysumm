TITLE

Claudin-3 regulates bile canalicular paracellular barrier and cholesterol gallstone core formation in mice

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Gallstone diseases have various symptoms, including pain and fever, and can lead to life-threatening conditions such as acute cholangitis, acute cholecystitis, biliary pancreatitis, and cancer of the biliary tract.1,2

Given that gallstone diseases have a high incidence rate, are costly to treat surgically, and are responsible for lost work hours due to symptoms, preventing these diseases should have deep impacts on health and society.1

PARAGRAPH

Gallstones are categorized into several types, including cholesterol, pigment, and phosphate gallstones, suggesting that there are different pathomechanisms for gallstone diseases.2–4

Cholesterol gallstone disease has received a lot of attention because it has the highest prevalence, which is increasing.2

In many cases, calcium and “calcium-sensitive” anions (phosphate, carbonate, stearate and/or palmitate) form the core of the cholesterol gallstone.4–6

The pathomechanisms for cholesterol gallstone disease have been mostly studied with respect to changes in biliary lipids (cholesterol, bile acid, phospholipid, etc.) resulting from lipid overdose in the modern diet and from aging-associated dysfunctional lipid metabolism.7–13

In contrast, the roles of ionic balance and its regulation in this process are unknown, although it is important to understand them, since some of these ions are used extensively as food additives and preservatives.14

PARAGRAPH

The hepatobiliary system involves a balanced homeostasis of ions, water, and biliary lipids, which are regulated by transporters and channels on liver epithelial cells.15–17

Epithelial tight junctions (TJs) function as a paracellular barrier for water, ions, and/or other small molecules.18,19

The major protein component of TJs is claudin, a protein family with at least 27 members in mammals.20

Claudin’s extracellular region plays essential roles in the paracellular barrier functions of TJs.21–23

Hepatic TJs mainly consist of claudin-1, -2, -3, -12, and -25.24,25

We previously reported that mice with knockout of claudin-2, a paracellular “channel-forming” claudin,26–30 develop cholesterol gallstone disease because of a decrease in paracellular water permeability.25,31

However, the role of claudin-3 (Cldn3), which is the most highly expressed paracellular “barrier-forming” claudin in the liver and hepatobiliary system has remained unclear.

Additionally, the mechanisms by which TJ dysfunction causes gallstone diseases are not well understood.

In this respect, the hemizygous deletion of several genes including CLDN3 at 7q11.23 in Williams-Beuren syndrome32–34 and gallstone formation in a patient with Williams-Beuren syndrome have been reported.35

PARAGRAPH

In the present study, we sought to clarify the role of biliary ions in the pathomechanism of cholesterol gallstone disease.

We focused on the specific paracellular barrier function of Cldn3, whose expression in mouse liver decreases with age.36

We found that in the liver of Cldn3-knockout mice, the paracellular permeability of phosphate ions across hepatic TJs was increased, resulting in the generation of calcium phosphate cores and the accelerated formation of cholesterol gallstones by cholesterol overdose.

Thus, we provide in vivo evidence that the altered biliary metabolism of ions including phosphate ions, combined with dysfunctional cholesterol metabolism, plays a major role in the lifestyle- and age-related risks for cholesterol gallstone disease.

These findings help elucidate health problems that can occur as a result of diet, aging, and the high levels of calcium phosphate used as a food preservative, revealing new research directions for improving liver metabolism and function.

Mouse treatment

PARAGRAPH

All animal experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Osaka University School of Medicine Animal Studies Committee, as described previously.25,37

Mice were group-housed (from 1–3 mice per cage) in standard mouse cages with the animal bedding (ALPHA-dri, Shepherd Specialty Papers, Michigan, USA) under the specific pathogen-free condition, and maintained with free access to water and standard mouse chow (MF, Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) under a 12 h light/dark cycle.

Male (n = 244) and female mice (n = 86) were used for the experiments.

For the cholesterol overdose experiments, 6-week-old male and female mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet (1.25% cholesterol w/w and 0.5% sodium cholic acid w/w) (Research Diets, Inc, D10090902).

After 4 weeks on the high-cholesterol diet, the 10-week-old male and female mice were sacrificed.

PARAGRAPH

We generated Cldn3 knockout (Cldn3KO) mice.

The Cldn3 gene consists of a single exon.

We used homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to produce two phenotypically identical mouse lines that were homozygous for the targeted mutation in the Cldn3 locus (Fig. S1A).

The targeting vector was constructed as shown in Fig. S1A.

Mixed background mice of 129S and C57B/6J were used to generate the chimeric mice.

The chimeric mice were crossed with C57BL/6J mice to obtain Cldn3 heterozygous knockout mice, which were used to obtain homozygous knockout (Cldn3KO) mice.

Littermate Cldn3 wild-type (WT) and Cldn3KO mice were used in all experiments.

Disruption of the Cldn3 locus was confirmed by Southern blot analysis, using a probe flanking the region upstream of the targeting vector (Fig. S1A).

PARAGRAPH

The Cldn3 WT allele was detected by PCR using Cldn3-s1 (5′-TATAACCCG TTGGTGCCCGAG-3′) as the sense and Cldn3-as1 (5′-GGTTCATCGACTGCT GGTAGTG-3′) as the antisense primer.

The Cldn3KO allele was detected by PCR using Cldn3-s2 (5′-GATATTGCTGAAG AGCTTGGCGG-3′) as the sense and Cldn3-as1 (5′-GGTTCATCGAC TGCTGGTAGTG-3′) as the antisense primer.

Biochemical analyses of gallbladder bile, hepatic bile, feces, serum, and gallstones

PARAGRAPH

After a 4 h fast, 10-week-old male and female mice were sacrificed.

The gallbladder bile, hepatic bile, and serum were collected and analyzed as described previously.25

Feces were collected from individually housed mice over 3 days and analyzed as described previously.38

The concentrations of total cholesterol, phospholipid, total bile acid, total bilirubin, total glutathione, triglyceride, and free fatty acid were measured as described previously.25,38,39

For the metabolomic analyses, 12- and 36-week-old male mice were sacrificed after a 4 h fast.

The serum bile acid composition was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry as described previously.38

The gallstone composition was analyzed by infrared absorption spectrophotometry (SRL, Inc., Tokyo, Japan).

SECTION

Measurement of bile flow rate

PARAGRAPH

After a 4 h fast, 10-week-old male and female mice were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of mixed anesthetic agents consisting of domitor, dormicum, and vetorphale (0.3, 4.0, and 4.8 mg/kg body weight, respectively).

The abdomen was opened, the cystic duct was ligated, and a 30G needle was inserted into the distal portion of the common bile duct near the branch point to the gallbladder and liver.

The abdominal temperature was maintained at 37 °C.

To measure the bile flow rate, the hepatic bile was collected for 30 min, and the volume of hepatic bile was determined.

SECTION

Measurement of ion concentrations of hepatic bile and blood plasma

PARAGRAPH

Hepatic bile was collected from 10-week-old male and female mice as described above.

Blood plasma was collected from the hepatic portal vein by an inserted 26G cannula.

The inorganic phosphorus concentration ([Pi]) was measured by an enzymatic method (Nagahama Life Science Laboratory, Shiga, Japan).

The total calcium concentration ([Ca]) was measured using a Metallo Assay Calcium (Ca) LS (CPZIII) (Metallogenics Co., Ltd., Chiba, Japan).

The concentrations of ionic calcium ([Ca2+]) and bicarbonate ([HCO3−]) were immediately measured by a portable clinical analyzer i-STAT®1 (FUSO Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan).

The hepatic bile pH was measured using a pH electrode (Chemical Instruments Co., LTD, Kanagawa, Japan). [

Na+] and [K+] were measured using an ion-selective electrode (Horiba, Tokyo, Japan), and [Cl−] was measured using the QuantiChrom Chloride Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA).

SECTION

Measurement of phosphorus, calcium, and ionic calcium permeability across liver epithelium

PARAGRAPH

After a 4 h fast, 10-week-old male and female mice were anesthetized, a 30G needle was inserted at the distal portion of the common bile duct for hepatic bile collection, as described above, and a 30G needle was inserted into the tail vein.

To measure the epithelial permeability to phosphorus, first, a hepatic bile sample was collected for 20 min, and a blood plasma sample was collected from the hepatic portal vein, as described above (phosphorus non-injected condition).

A 100 mM Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4 solution (pH 7.4) (1 ml volume/100 g body weight) was then injected into the mouse tail vein (phosphorus-injected condition), and a hepatic bile sample under the phosphorus-injected condition was collected for 10 min.

After collecting this bile sample, a blood plasma sample under the phosphorus-injected condition was immediately collected from the hepatic portal vein.

The total calcium (Ca) or ionic calcium (Ca2+) permeability was measured similarly to the phosphorus permeability, except that the hepatic bile sample for Ca or Ca2+ detection under the Ca non-injected condition was collected for 20 or 40 min, respectively.

The hepatic bile sample for Ca or Ca2+ under the Ca-injected condition was collected for 10 or 15 min, respectively, after the injection of 100 mM CaCl2 solution (1 ml volume/100 g body weight).

The [Pi], [Ca], and [Ca2+] in the hepatic bile and blood plasma samples were measured as described above.

Results

SECTION

Increased paracellular water permeability due to claudin-3 deficiency increased bile flow

PARAGRAPH

In the hepatobiliary system, CLDN3 was expressed in both the perivenous and periportal hepatocytes almost equally, and in the cholangiocytes, and gallbladder epithelial cells, as described previously (Fig. 1, Fig. S1D, Fig. S2E).24,25

We generated gene knockout mice, Cldn3KO (Fig. 1, Fig. S1A-D, Fig. S2D, E), and found that they showed phenotypes in biliary metabolism that led to gallstone diseases.

The gallbladder bile and hepatic bile of Cldn3KO mice were lighter green than those of WT mice (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the bile was diluted in the Cldn3KO mice.

PARAGRAPH

Examinations of the gallbladder bile and hepatic bile revealed that the concentrations of biliary lipids (cholesterol, phospholipids, and bile acids), bilirubin, and glutathione were all significantly lower in the Cldn3KO than in the WT mice (Fig. 2B,C).

The total amounts of biliary lipids that were secreted as fecal lipids were almost the same between the WT and Cldn3KO mice (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the decreased bile component concentrations in Cldn3KO mice were due to the increased paracellular and/or transcellular water permeability across liver epithelial cells.

Consistent with this scenario, the bile flow rate in the Cldn3KO mice was about twice that in the WT mice, while the gallbladder bile did not exhibit a significant difference in volume (Fig. 2E).

The serum bile acid levels were significantly increased in the Cldn3KO compared with WT mice (Fig. 2F), suggesting that the Cldn3 deficiency also increased the paracellular permeability of bile canalicular epithelia to bile acids.

PARAGRAPH

The permeability of epithelial cell sheets to water is partly regulated by water channel proteins called aquaporins (AQPs).40

Although the Aqp9 mRNA was slightly lower in the Cldn3KO liver, there were no other significant differences in the mRNA levels, protein levels, or tissue/cell localizations of AQPs between the WT and Cldn3KO livers (Fig. S4A-C).

The expressions and localizations of cell-cell junctional molecules other than Cldn3 in the liver and gallbladder also showed almost no differences between WT and Cldn3KO mice (Fig. S1B-E, Fig. S2A-F).

In addition, there were almost no differences detected in the cellular and tissue architectures of the liver observed by immunofluorescence, HE staining, and electron microscopy between the WT and Cldn3KO mice (Fig. 2G, H, Fig. S3A-D).

There were also no significant differences in the mRNA levels of genes involved in biliary lipid metabolism between the WT and Cldn3KO mice (Fig. S4D).

PARAGRAPH

These findings strongly suggested that in Cldn3KO mice, the enhanced bile flow rate and dilution of bile components were caused by the increased paracellular water transport across the TJs of liver epithelial cells, such as hepatocytes and cholangiocytes.

SECTION

Increased paracellular phosphate ion permeability due to claudin-3 deficiency induces phosphate gallstone disease

PARAGRAPH

Approximately 20% of the Cldn3KO mice spontaneously developed gallstones, whereas 0% of the WT mice did (Fig. 3A).

We therefore wondered whether the gallstone disease was caused by the increased paracellular water permeability.

We previously reported that KO of Cldn2, a “channel-forming” claudin, caused cholesterol gallstone disease in mice, due to a decrease in paracellular water permeability, which leads to an elevated hepatic bile concentration.25,31

However, the Cldn3KO mice showed an increase in paracellular water permeability, the opposite change to that seen in Cldn2KO mice, suggesting that the gallstones were generated by different pathomechanisms in these two mouse mutants.

PARAGRAPH

We also found a difference in the gallstone composition between the Cldn2KO and Cldn3KO mice.

The Cldn3KO gallstones were more than 98% calcium phosphate (Fig. 3B), suggesting that changes in the paracellular transport of these ions were involved in the gallstone formation.

Therefore, we next examined the biliary metabolism of phosphate ions.

The phosphate ion concentration in hepatic bile was detected as the concentration of inorganic phosphorus [Pi].

The hepatic bile [Pi] in Cldn3KO mice was significantly higher than that in WT mice (Fig. 3C).

When the phosphate ion was intravenously administered into the blood, the Cldn3KO mice showed a greater increase in hepatic bile [Pi] than the WT mice (Fig. 3C).

The blood [Pi] indicated that phosphate ion was equally loaded into these mice (Fig. 3C).

These observations suggested that phosphate ions are paracellularly transported across hepatocyte cell sheets from the sinusoidal blood side to the bile canalicular lumen, and that this transport is increased in the Cldn3KO mice.

There were no significant differences in the mRNA levels of phosphate transporters, which regulate the transcellular permeability of phosphate ions,41 between the WT and Cldn3KO liver (Fig. S4E).

PARAGRAPH

These findings strongly suggested that in Cldn3KO mice, dysfunctional biliary phosphorus metabolism due to increased paracellular phosphate ion permeability induced the formation of calcium phosphate gallstones.

SECTION

Elevated [Ca2+] due to claudin-3 deficiency induces phosphate gallstone disease

PARAGRAPH

We next focused on the biliary metabolism of calcium ions.

In hepatic bile, the portion of total Ca present as ionic Ca2+ binds to phosphate ions, resulting in the precipitation of calcium phosphate.6

The paracellular permeability of liver epithelia for Ca and Ca2+ was the same in WT and Cldn3KO mice (Fig. 3D,E).

On the other hand, the hepatic bile [Ca2+] of Cldn3KO mice was slightly elevated compared with that of WT mice.

This [Ca2+] elevation was also likely to be involved in the phosphate gallstone formation.

PARAGRAPH

Therefore, we examined the mechanism of the [Ca2+] elevation involving the Cl−-HCO3−-pH axis.

In hepatic bile, [Ca2+] is regulated by pH, because in acidic conditions, the negatively charged carboxyl residues of organic anions are protonated, which prevents them from binding Ca2+.42

The hepatic bile of Cldn3KO mice was significantly more acidic than that of WT mice, and the HCO3− concentration in the Cldn3KO hepatic bile was lower than in the WT hepatic bile (Fig. 3F).

It is generally accepted that the hepatic bile pH is mostly determined by bicarbonate, which is partly regulated by the epithelial chloride/bicarbonate (Cl−/HCO3−) exchanger.43

PARAGRAPH

The hepatic bile [Cl−] in Cldn3KO mice was significantly higher than that in WT mice (Fig. 3G), which might have been due to the increased paracellular Cl− permeability of the hepatic TJs.

Considering that the osmolality of the WT and Cldn3KO hepatic bile was the same (Fig. 3H), a decrease in HCO3− secretion due to Cl− accumulation might have acidified the Cldn3KO bile.

Thus, in the Cldn3KO bile, metabolic changes in the Cl−-HCO3−-pH axis, caused by the increased paracellular Cl− permeability, probably led to the slight increase in [Ca2+].

PARAGRAPH

Collectively, these findings suggested that in Cldn3KO mice, the slightly altered biliary metabolism of Ca2+ caused by the enhanced paracellular permeability of chloride ions contributed to the formation of phosphate gallstones.

SECTION

Calcium phosphate core formation due to claudin-3 deficiency induces cholesterol gallstone disease

PARAGRAPH

Calcium phosphate, which is commonly used as a food additive and preservative, often forms the core of cholesterol gallstones.14

However, the pathogenesis of this disease, including the roles of ionic balance and its regulation, remains poorly understood.

PARAGRAPH

We next examined whether the dysfunctional biliary metabolism of calcium and phosphorus due to Cldn3 deficiency accelerated the formation of cholesterol gallstones.

After treatment with a high-cholesterol diet, which is used to experimentally induce cholesterol gallstone formation, WT and Cldn3KO mice showed the characteristics of fatty liver, which neither strain exhibited after a normal diet (Fig. 4A).

Under the cholesterol overdose condition, Cldn3KO mice developed cholesterol gallstone disease with a prevalence of about 50%, which was 0% in WT mice (Fig. 4B).

Notably, while the spontaneously generated phosphate gallstones in Cldn3KO mice were black, the gallstones in the Cldn3KO mice fed a high-cholesterol diet were yellow and white, which is a characteristic of cholesterol gallstones (Fig. 4C).3

We also confirmed that under the conditions of cholesterol overdose, the paracellular water and phosphate ion permeabilities of the biliary epithelia in the Cldn3KO mice were still higher than those in WT mice (Fig. 4D, E).

PARAGRAPH

These findings revealed that Cldn3 deficiency causes dysfunctional biliary ion metabolism that induces the formation of calcium phosphate cores, which accelerate the formation of cholesterol gallstones by cholesterol overdose.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Cholesterol saturation is known to be the primary cause of cholesterol gallstone disease.2

At the early stage of disease development, precipitates of calcium phosphate, which have been identified in the cores of cholesterol gallstones, are believed to accelerate gallstone formation.4–6

However, the pathophysiological roles of these ions and their dysregulations have been unclear, because the molecular mechanisms of these ion regulations in the hepatobiliary system are not well understood.

In this study, we found that in the hepatobiliary system, Cldn3 functions as a paracellular barrier for phosphate ions, and that dysfunction of this barrier causes significant dysfunctional biliary metabolism of phosphorus, which leads to the formation of calcium phosphate cores for cholesterol gallstones.

PARAGRAPH

In general, claudins function as a paracellular barrier for water, ions, and/or organic solutes.19,44

However, the substances blocked by claudins in vivo are still unclear.

Cldn3 was previously observed to function as a paracellular barrier for ions and small solutes in an in vitro epithelial cell system.45

Here we revealed in an in vivo hepatobiliary system that Cldn3 functions as a paracellular barrier for water and anions such as chloride and phosphate ions.

We also showed that a deficiency in the paracellular barrier for phosphate ions due to Cldn3 loss induces cholesterol gallstone disease.

PARAGRAPH

We previously reported that Cldn2KO mice develop cholesterol gallstone disease as a result of decreased paracellular water permeability, which leads to an elevated cholesterol concentration in the hepatic bile.25,31

In the present study, we showed that Cldn3 deficiency spontaneously induces the formation of calcium phosphate gallstones due to an enhanced paracellular permeability of phosphate ions.

In addition, in Cldn2KO mice under cholesterol overdose conditions, precipitated calcium phosphate formed the cores of cholesterol gallstones.

Our knockout mouse models of “barrier-forming” Cldn3 and “channel-forming” Cldn2 suggest that dysregulation of the balanced paracellular barrier functions of these claudins for water and phosphate ions determines not only the characteristics but also the pathogenesis of gallstone diseases (Fig. 5).

Optimizing the paracellular barrier functions for both water and ions would be required to effectively prevent these gallstone diseases.

PARAGRAPH

Here we focused on the paracellular “barrier-forming” Cldn3, whose expression in mouse liver decreases with age.36

We found that in the mouse hepatobiliary system, Cldn3 functions as a paracellular barrier for water, phosphate ions, and chloride ions, and that Cldn3 dysfunction causes significant dysfunction in biliary metabolism of phosphorus and slight dysfunction in the metabolism of calcium.

Thus, we provide in vivo evidence that the altered biliary metabolism of these ions, combined with that of cholesterol, has a major role in the lifestyle- and age-related risks for cholesterol gallstone disease.

These findings have implications for social issues associated with aging, high-fat diets, and the broad use of calcium phosphate as a food preservative.
