TITLE

Patient-reported symptoms during and after direct-acting antiviral therapies for chronic hepatitis C: The PROP UP study

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection often report neuropsychiatric, somatic, and gastrointestinal symptoms including fatigue, sleep disturbance, musculoskeletal pain, depression, and abdominal pain.1–3

Patients may attribute these symptoms to HCV, a chronic viral infection associated with several extrahepatic disorders.

Recent studies show that health-related quality of life and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs) improve during all-oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy and after patients achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR).4–6

These studies were based exclusively on data derived from industry-sponsored registration trials.

It remains critical to determine if these findings can be generalized to patients treated in real-world clinical practices given inherent biases of registration trial data.7,8

PARAGRAPH

Clinical trials enroll highly selected patients and typically under-represent important subgroups of the HCV population.9–11

Patients with psychosocial vulnerabilities (e.g., active psychiatric, drug use, alcohol use) are often excluded, yet these patients make up a sizeable majority of the population in need of treatment.

In addition, a majority of these trials are comprised of predominantly white patients (66–97%) and those without advanced fibrosis (<20% cirrhosis).9–11

Prior studies have also focused heavily on quality of life, work productivity, and fatigue outcomes but have not comprehensively evaluated specific somatic, gastrointestinal and neuropsychiatric symptoms often associated with chronic HCV.2

A more comprehensive description of symptom and function changes would enhance our understanding of the full spectrum of patients’ experiences.

Finally, PRO studies that allow for comparisons of patient experiences across different DAA regimens are lacking.

PARAGRAPH

The current study enrolled a diverse cohort of patients initiating DAA therapy at several academic and community-based practices and includes a significant number of previously under-represented subgroups.

We evaluated changes in overall symptom burden, specific HCV symptoms, functional well-being and health comorbidities in patients prescribed 1 of 4 DAA regimens: sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LED); SOF/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL); grazoprevir/elbasvir (GRZ/ELB) and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with dasabuvir (PrOD), as well as providing a comprehensive characterization of real-world patient experiences during and after DAA therapy.

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Study design

PARAGRAPH

The PROP UP study is funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and described in detail in prior publications.12,13

In brief, it is a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study that enrolled patients across the US to characterize patients’ experiences associated with HCV, DAA treatments, and virologic cure.

The current analysis utilized data collected at 4 time points: (T1) “Baseline” prior to starting DAA; (T2) “Early On-Treatment” week 4 ± 2 weeks; (T3) “Late On-Treatment” last 2–3 weeks of therapy (e.g., weeks 10–12 for 12-week course); and (T4) “Post-Treatment” 12 ± 2 weeks post-treatment.

SECTION

Participants and settings

PARAGRAPH

PROP UP enrolled a total of 1,601 patients between January 2016 and October 2017 at 11 US centers (9 academic hepatology centers, 2 private gastroenterology practices).

PARAGRAPH

All sites obtained Institutional Review Board approval and all patients provided informed consent prior to data collection.

SECTION

Baseline characteristics

SECTION

Sociodemographics

PARAGRAPH

Patients self-reported the following characteristics at baseline: date of birth, biological sex, race, ethnicity, educational attainment, annual household income, and employment status.

SECTION

Mental health issues

PARAGRAPH

Patients who self-reported a history of any past psychiatric hospitalization or were taking psychiatric medications for ‘depression, anxiety or nerve problems’ at baseline were categorized as having mental health issues.

SECTION

Drug use

PARAGRAPH

Patients who self-reported use of non-prescription illicit street drugs or misuse of prescription medications in the year before enrollment using validated items from the Substance Abuse Mental Illness Symptoms Screener (SAMISS) were categorized as having substance use issues.14

SECTION

Alcohol use

PARAGRAPH

Patients who scored ≥5 on 3 alcohol questions at baseline related to current frequency, quantity, and binge drinking using validated items from the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and the SAMISS were classified as having alcohol use.14,15

SECTION

Cirrhosis

PARAGRAPH

Patients were classified as having cirrhosis (yes/no) based on review of clinical, laboratory, imaging, histology, and transient elastography data in electronic health records.

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI) >2.0 and the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score ≥12 were used to indicate advanced liver disease only in patients classified as having cirrhosis.16,17

Adjudication of cases with inconsistent data was made by an experienced hepatologist (M.W.F.) or site investigators/hepatologists.

SECTION

Additional laboratory and treatment markers

PARAGRAPH

HCV genotype, HCV RNA level, AST, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, total bilirubin, platelets, hemoglobin, creatinine, international normalized ratio (INR), HIV, treatment regimen, treatment duration, and treatment experience were also recorded.

SECTION

Sustained virologic response

PARAGRAPH

SVR was defined as an undetectable HCV RNA at 10 or more weeks after treatment completion.

In 15 patients, lack of SVR was based on quantifiable HCV RNA around follow-up week 4.

SECTION

Patient-reported outcomes

PARAGRAPH

Additional details about these PROs are provided in the published protocol and baseline cohort analysis.12,18

SECTION

Individual symptom clusters

PARAGRAPH

The National Institutes of Health’s Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System® (PROMIS®) instruments were used to assess 10 specific symptoms that fall into 3 symptom clusters: Neuropsychiatric Cluster (depression, anxiety, anger, cognitive concerns); Somatic Cluster (pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance); and Gastrointestinal Cluster (abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting).19–21

There is no PROMIS instrument to measure headache, therefore the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) was used to capture headaches that may be associated with DAA therapy.22,23

The HIT-6 has a 5-point Likert response scale ranging from “Never” to “Always.”

We previously evaluated the psychometric properties of the PROMIS and HIT-6 instruments in patients with HCV and have found satisfactory reliability and validity.18,24

Higher PROMIS and HIT-6 scores reflect worse symptom experiences.

SECTION

Overall symptom burden

PARAGRAPH

A comprehensive list of 32 symptoms common to many health conditions were assessed using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS).25,26

Participants reported the presence or absence of symptoms (yes = 1/no = 0), and if present, its severity (0–4), frequency (0–4) and level of distress (0–4).

The total score (TMSAS) could range from 0–4 and was multiplied by 10 for ease of interpretation with other PROs.

SECTION

Functional well-being

PARAGRAPH

The HCV-PRO is a newly developed HCV-specific survey designed to evaluate the functioning and psychological well-being of patients with HCV.27,28

The scale includes 16 items that measure various aspects of physical and emotional functioning, productivity, intimacy, and perceived quality of life related to having HCV.

The 16 items are summed to produce a total score transformed on a scale of 0 (worst) to 100 (best).

Unlike the other PROs, higher scores on the HCV-PRO are associated with better functional well-being.

To display change in the HCV-PRO score in the same figures (below), the HCV-PRO change score was reverse coded.

SECTION

Statistical analysis strategy

SECTION

Primary analysis

PARAGRAPH

The mean changes in each PRO score from T1 to T2, T3 and T4 Post-Treatment were estimated along with corresponding 95% CIs.

For the investigation of change from baseline to on-treatment in the primary analyses, we used the average of the T2 and T3 PRO scores because these scores were moderately to highly correlated (r = 0.52–0.79).

The estimates of mean changes were computed without adjustment for other covariates or confounders.

The primary analysis focused on symptom-specific estimates of the magnitude of mean change from T1 to T2/T3 and T4 in the combined cohort, each of 4 DAA cohorts, those who achieved SVR and other subgroups of interest.

SECTION

Descriptives

PARAGRAPH

Tabular and graphical methods were used to visualize the data (mean [SD], range), change in PROs, or percent change from baseline.

SECTION

Minimally important change

PARAGRAPH

To aid our clinical interpretation of the unadjusted PRO change scores, we defined a 5% change from baseline as the “minimally important change (MIC)” threshold based on the published literature and feedback from our patient engagement group about what amount of change would be meaningful to them related to treatment decision-making.5,29

For the PROMIS symptom measures in which T-scores are standardized to a mean of 50 and an SD of 10, previous studies have suggested 2.0–5.0 points as the MIC threshold in other populations.21,30,31

Evaluation of the PROMIS baseline data revealed that a 5% change in baseline scores would range from 1.9–2.8 points for each of the 10 PROMIS measures.

Thus, we set the MIC for all PROMIS measures at 2.5 points.

For the HIT-6, a 5% change from baseline was estimated at 2.3 points, while the HIT-6 MIC in the literature is estimated at 1.5–2.5.32

Therefore, we set the MIC for the HIT-6 at 2.5 points.

A 5% change from baseline for the HCV-PRO was 3.6 points, thus we set the MIC for the HCV-PRO at 4 points.

A 5% MIC change in the TMSAS×10 score was 3.0 points.

These MIC thresholds are conservative estimates to mitigate the risk of committing Type I error (i.e., false positives).

A PRO change score that increased >5% is suggestive of clinically significant worse symptoms, whereas a PRO change score that decreased >5% is suggestive of clinically significant improvements.

SECTION

Multivariable regression models using data-splitting strategies

PARAGRAPH

Generalized linear regression models were used for both exploratory and confirmatory evaluation of predictors of PRO change from baseline to on-treatment and baseline to post-treatment.

Absolute mean PRO change scores (continuous) were used as the dependent variables.

We used a 2-stage modeling strategy based on data-splitting.

Participants were randomly assigned to 2 groups: Sample 1 or Sample 2.

Sample 1 was used for exploratory model building efforts to generate a set of candidate predictor variables that might be associated with change in each PRO.

Model building with Sample 1 relied on unsupervised use of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator methods and model averaging algorithms.

Sample 2 was used for confirmation.

In Sample 2, the variables in the hypothesized model were considered validated if their regression coefficients were statistically significant at p <0.01.

Candidate predictor variables available for inclusion in the exploratory models in Sample 1 included the following baseline covariates: age, sex, race, education, income, employment, cirrhosis status, alcohol use, substance use, and mental health issues, ethnicity, MELD score in cirrhosis patients, HIV, DAA treatment cohort, ribavirin (RBV) use, treatment duration, treatment experience, and number of health comorbidities.

SECTION

Multiple imputation

PARAGRAPH

For use in multivariable regression models, missing values of baseline covariates (not PROs) were assumed to satisfy the missing-at-random criterion and were addressed via multiple imputations.

A multivariate multiple imputation algorithm (SAS procedure MI) was used to generate 20 completed copies of the dataset.

Each statistical regression model of interest was fitted to all 20 datasets.

The 20 sets of results were combined (SAS procedure MIANALYZE) to produce the final results for each multivariable regression model.

SECTION

Sensitivity analyses

PARAGRAPH

To guide our level of trust in the main results, sensitivity analyses were performed in which the methods and assumptions used were perturbed using variations on multiple imputation variable-selection methods (with and without supervision), definitions of variables (e.g., age (years) vs. using age-groups), use of alternative methods for addressing confounding, and exploring the 2 on-treatment assessment windows (T2/T3) separately to compare with our main results.

SECTION

Statistical computations

PARAGRAPH

Statistical computations were performed using SAS System software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

PROMIS T-scores were computed using R software, version 3.1.2 (2014 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing), and RStudio software, version 1.0.136 (RStudio Inc.).

SECTION

Results

SECTION

Study flowchart

PARAGRAPH

The study flowchart is provided in Fig. 1.

Of the 1,601 patients enrolled, 1,564 patients (98%) completed PROs early on-treatment (T2), late on-treatment (T3), or at 12-weeks post-treatment (T4) and were included in the analyses of the total cohort.

The cohort of patients prescribed daclatasvir/sofusbuvir were excluded due to low sample size (n = 22).

Of those with baseline and post-treatment PROs, 1,410 patients (90%) had post-treatment HCV RNA available to determine SVR status.

Of these, 1,346 (95%) achieved SVR.

A total of 154 patients had missing HCV RNA data: 10 died, 4 withdrew before T4 and 140 did not return for post-treatment follow-up laboratory tests.

SECTION

Patient characteristics

PARAGRAPH

Table 1 describes the baseline characteristics of the total cohort and the 4 DAA subgroups.

The majority of patients were prescribed SOF/LED (63%) and 5% were prescribed PrOD.

The mean age of the overall cohort was 58 years (SD = 11; range 23–86).

Of the overall cohort, 55% of patients were male and 33% were black (61% white).

The majority were from lower socioeconomic status groups with 54% ≤high school degree, 74% <$40,000 per year income, and 45% receiving or applying for disability benefits.

Over half of patients had 4+ health comorbidities, with an average of 4 (range: 0–17).

The majority were infected with HCV genotype 1, 4, or 6 (83%), 82% received 12 weeks of therapy and 13% were prescribed RBV.

Of the 47% classified as having cirrhosis, 14% had an MELD ≥12.

Notably, several other patient subgroups often under-represented in registration trials were well-represented in this cohort: 39% non-white, 37% with mental health issues, 15% with alcohol use, and 23% with substance use.

PARAGRAPH

Patient characteristics across the 4 DAA subgroups were similar except for the cohort prescribed GRZ/ELB, which included a higher proportion of patients who were black, on disability benefits, with lower income, with a higher number of comorbidities, and higher mean creatinine scores, likely contributing to elevated MELD scores.

As expected, more patients on PrOD were prescribed RBV.

SECTION

Change in PRO scores from baseline to on- and post-treatment

PARAGRAPH

Fig. 2 shows the mean change and MIC threshold value for 13 PROs from baseline to T2, T3 and T4 in the total cohort (n = 1,564).

During treatment, the majority of PRO scores reduced slightly from baseline (− sign suggests symptom reduction); however, diarrhea, nausea, and headache increased slightly early in treatment (+ sign suggest symptom worsens).

The magnitude of PRO mean changes during DAA therapy was small and none of the mean changes reached the 5% clinically significant MIC thresholds.

All PRO means improved from baseline to post-treatment (− signs suggest improvements) with fatigue, sleep disturbance and functional well-being reaching the MIC thresholds for >5% clinically significant improvements.

PARAGRAPH

We also evaluated PRO mean change scores stratified by 4 DAA subgroups (Fig. S1A-C).

Overall, the magnitude of PRO mean changes was very small and the vast majority of changes did not reach the 5% clinical thresholds.

However, some trends are worth noting.

Whereas the majority of PRO mean change scores reduced slightly during treatment for patients prescribed SOF/LED, SOF/VEL and GRZ/ELB, patients prescribed PrOD consistently showed worse PRO change scores during treatment, with diarrhea and nausea mean change scores reaching the MIC for clinically worse symptoms.

Finally, the only clinically significant improvement in PRO on-treatment was a 6.5-point improvement in HCV-PRO functional well-being in the GRZ/ELB cohort.

SECTION

Proportion of change in PROs and pre-existing conditions from baseline to on-treatment

PARAGRAPH

While the mean score changes in the overall cohort from baseline to on-treatment were small in magnitude, we observed wide variability in individual patient’s change scores.

Fig. 3 shows the proportion of patients deemed to have little or no change (<5% change from baseline in either direction), those with clinically significant improvements, and those with clinically significant worsening.

For example, over 40% of patients reported substantial improvements in fatigue, sleep disturbance, overall symptom burden and functional well-being, approximately 30% experienced worsening of these symptoms.

SECTION

PRO changes stratified by SVR status

PARAGRAPH

As previously noted, of 1,410 patients with evaluable SVR data, 1,346 (95%) achieved SVR and 64 (5%) did not, with 140 (10%) patients lost to follow-up with missing post-treatment HCV RNA data.

PARAGRAPH

As shown in Fig. 4, all PRO mean scores improved from baseline to early post-treatment in patients who achieved SVR, with clinically significant improvements in fatigue (−4.1), sleep disturbance (−3.0) and functional well-being (−6.4), and a trend for depression and pain to improve (−2.3).

Among the 64 patients who did not achieve SVR, 5 mean PRO scores worsened during early post-treatment and no PROs showed clinically significant improvements (>5% MIC), with the exception of fatigue (−2.8).

Similarly, Fig. 5 shows the percent change in PRO mean scores from baseline to early post-treatment.

Patients who achieved SVR exhibited the most clinically significant improvements in functional well-being (20%), overall symptom burden (13%), and somatic symptoms.

In contrast, the 64 patients who did not achieve SVR had worsening or negligible changes for most PROs except a few.

It is essential to note that 91% of all patients who completed their T4 post-treatment surveys were unaware of their SVR status at the time of survey completion.

PARAGRAPH

Compared to patients who achieved SVR, the 64 patients who did not achieve SVR were more likely to be male (62% vs. 55%), have cirrhosis (56% vs. 47%), treatment experience (33% vs. 18%), longer duration of therapy (13% vs. 8%), RBV use (19% vs. 13%) and APRI >2.0 (20% vs. 14%) (Table 2).

PARAGRAPH

Compared to patients who achieved SVR, those who did not have a follow-up HCV RNA test (n = 140) tended to be younger (15% vs. 5%), have lower income (89% vs. 73%), higher rates of unemployment (17% vs. 6%), mental health issues (54% vs. 35%), and treatment inexperience (91% vs. 82%), but they did not have a higher rate of alcohol use (16% vs. 15%) or drug use (24% vs. 22%) (Table 2).

SECTION

Multivariable models for symptom changes on- and post-treatment

PARAGRAPH

Using data-splitting strategies and data from all patients (n = 1,564), multivariable analyses showed that being aged 35–55 (for anger and overall symptom burden) and having baseline mental health issues (for depression, fatigue, functional well-being) were the most consistent independent predictors of symptom improvements during DAA therapy (Table S1).

We also found that patients prescribed PrOD had worse overall symptom burden (1.8; 95% CI 0.4; 3.2; p <0.01) and a trend towards worse fatigue (3.3; 95% CI −0.1; 6.8; p = 0.06) during therapy relative to patients prescribed SOF/LED.

Other patient characteristics predictive of greater symptom improvements included other race, being disabled, having a higher number of comorbidities, and being treatment naïve.

PARAGRAPH

Similarly, multivariable analyses of patients who achieved SVR (n = 1,346) showed that being aged 35–55 was the most consistent independent predictor of post-treatment symptom improvements in anger, anxiety, fatigue, abdominal pain, and overall symptom burden (Table S2).

Other patient characteristics associated with greater symptom improvements after viral cure included being aged 20–34, white race, a higher number of health comorbidities, mental health disturbance, and substance use at baseline.

Patients prescribed PrOD experienced less improvements in anxiety after treatment compared to patients treated with SOF/LED.

The majority (71%) of the PrOD cohort also received RBV compared to 12% in other DAA cohorts.

PARAGRAPH

It is important to note that the following patient- and treatment-level characteristics were not selected as predictors in any of the final multivariable models: sex, ethnicity, cirrhosis status, MELD, HIV, income, education, alcohol use, or treatment duration.

SECTION

Sensitivity analysis

PARAGRAPH

Several sensitivity analyses were performed in which the methods and assumptions used were perturbed using variations on multiple imputation, variable-selection methods, definitions of variables, and alternative methods for addressing confounding.

We also explored the 2 on-treatment assessment windows (T2/T3) separately to compare with our main results.

These and all analyses produced results similar to the main analysis described above, increasing trust in the main results.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Many patients with chronic HCV experience symptoms that may be attributed to their disease.2,3

These patients look forward to viral eradication that may ameliorate those troublesome symptoms.

Although interferon-free DAA regimens have been shown to be well tolerated in clinical trials, these reports require confirmation from a broader and more heterogeneous cohort of patients treated in real-world clinical settings.

The current study represents the largest, most comprehensive investigation of patients’ experiences during and after treatment with several interferon-free DAA regimens prescribed in clinical practice.

This real-world clinical cohort was geographically heterogeneous and diverse with regard to race, cirrhosis status, and a wide range of comorbidities, including psychiatric, alcohol and substance use issues.12,13

To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide comparative PRO data collected from patients prescribed DAA regimens developed by different pharmaceutical companies and to include PRO data from patients who did and did not achieve viral cure.

Finally, we determined whether these PRO changes were clinically meaningful using a conservative threshold.

It is important to note that the vast majority (91%) of patients had no knowledge of SVR status before completing their post-treatment PRO surveys, providing strong evidence that improvements in PROs post-treatment are likely the result of viral eradication on biological processes, rather than only a psychological placebo effect.

PARAGRAPH

An important observation in this study is that while the average change in PRO scores of the total cohort was small, one-quarter to one-third reported worsening of symptoms during DAA therapy.

Previous PRO studies focused on reporting overall mean change scores but did not describe the full distribution of patients’ experiences.

Our findings have implications for how clinicians might help set expectations with patients initiating DAA therapy, for example providing a balanced perspective that some patients experience no changes, others experience improvements, but a third may experience worsening of baseline symptoms.

In accordance with other studies, PRO scores improved from baseline to post-treatment, with clinically meaningful improvements specifically in fatigue, sleep disturbance and functional well-being.

These improvements were more pronounced in patients who achieved SVR.

While other studies have reported improvement in quality of life in patients who achieved SVR,5 our study uniquely demonstrates that sleep and pain issues improve after viral eradication.

This is particularly meaningful since the prevalence of sleep and pain disorders are high among patients with chronic HCV.2,33–36

PARAGRAPH

We observed that younger patients (ages 35–55), and those with mental health issues or more health comorbidities reported the greatest symptom improvements during and after therapy.

These patients represent vulnerable subgroups with psychosocial and medical challenges who may benefit the most from being given the opportunity to rid themselves of a stigmatizing infectious disease and engage in healthcare.

These patients tended to have the worst symptoms at baseline with more room for improvement (data not shown), suggesting the possibility of regression towards the mean.

We found that cirrhosis was not independently associated with PRO changes during therapy or after viral cure indicating that patients with and without cirrhosis tend to experience similar symptom benefits.

It should be clarified that most patients with cirrhosis in this cohort had compensated liver disease.

PARAGRAPH

Overall, PRO changes in the cohorts of patients prescribed SOF/LED, SOF/VEL or GRZ/ELB were similar across the DAA cohorts while on-treatment with overall improvement in symptoms after treatment completion, 33% of which were clinically substantial improvements.

Therefore, patients can be counseled regarding the overall stability of symptoms during HCV therapy and improvements post-SVR regardless of which of these regimens are prescribed.

Patients prescribed PrOD had less improvement in PROs during treatment, including clinically significant worse diarrhea and nausea, and experienced the least improvements after completing treatment.

It should be noted that the number of patients who received PrOD was small and a higher proportion received ribavirin, which likely contributed to worsening symptoms during treatment.

Nevertheless, PrOD is no longer used in the US and many other countries, having been superseded by simpler, better tolerated DAA regimens.

PARAGRAPH

In this real-world cohort, 9% of patients did not return for follow-up HCV RNA testing to determine SVR status.

This was an unexpected finding since one would assume that most patients understood that DAAs are expensive and many had to wait a long time for insurance approval in order to receive treatment.

Patients who never came back for follow-up HCV RNA testing were disproportionately younger, had lower incomes, higher rates of unemployment, disability, mental health issues, and were more likely to be treatment naïve.

Contrary to speculation, these patients who were non-compliant with follow-up did not have higher rates of baseline drug or alcohol use.

These data indicate the importance of educating all patients about the importance of post-treatment laboratory tests, in particular younger patients and those at greater risk of being lost to clinical follow-up.

PARAGRAPH

A few limitations are worth noting.

The observational study design precludes any definitive head-to-head statistical comparisons of DAA regimens.

Amongst DAA regimens, SOF/LED was the most commonly prescribed while the other 3 DAA regimens were prescribed less often.

This study also included a relatively small number of patients with advanced liver disease or requiring liver transplantation.

Aside from laboratory tests, minimal clinical data were extracted from electronic health records.

The scope of this study did not include clinical data on fibrosis staging, decompensation events, medications or comorbid liver diseases or chronic illnesses.

Thus, by design, we have not compared patient-reported information with clinical health data or classified cirrhosis according to Child-Pugh scores.

Our findings may not generalize to other subpopulations or clinical settings, including younger people who are actively injecting drugs or individuals receiving medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders.

PARAGRAPH

The strengths of this study are worth noting.

This study is the largest comprehensive real-world PRO study during and after treatment with different DAA regimens.

We provided comparative data on 4 commonly prescribed DAA regimens.

The study population included many subpopulations under-represented in registration trials.

Unlike prior studies, we provided the full spectrum of patients’ experiences including those who experienced worsening of symptoms.

Although the non-SVR subgroup was small (n = 64), our study suggests that there may be differences in changes in PROs post-treatment between patients who do and do not achieve SVR.

These data are consistent with the positive effects of viral eradication on patients’ functioning and specific symptoms.

Finally, PROP UP has been a highly patient-centered study since its inception with patients engaged throughout all phases of study development to ensure that our findings are meaningful and relevant to people affected by the disease.12,37

PARAGRAPH

This comprehensive assessment of changes in neuropsychiatric, somatic and gastrointestinal symptoms, and functional well-being during and after therapy with all-oral DAA therapies provides new insights relevant to patients, clinicians and other stakeholders.
