TITLE

An ordinal model to predict the risk of symptomatic liver failure in patients with cirrhosis undergoing hepatectomy

PARAGRAPH

In patients with liver cirrhosis, the risk of a hepatectomy is difficult to appreciate.

We propose a statistical tool to estimate this risk, preoperatively and immediately after surgery, using readily available parameters and on online calculator.

This model could help to improve the selection of patients with the best risk-benefit profiles for hepatectomy.
