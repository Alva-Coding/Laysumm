TITLE

Prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes in children and adolescents with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

PARAGRAPH

Children with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have a higher prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance (prediabetes or type 2 diabetes) than children without NAFLD.

Children with biopsy-proven NAFLD and abnormal glucose tolerance also have a higher prevalence of the progressive form of disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, than those with normal glucose tolerance, though central adiposity is the factor that is most strongly associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
