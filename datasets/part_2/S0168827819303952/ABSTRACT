ABSTRACT

TITLE

Prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes in children and adolescents with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

PARAGRAPH

We undertook a cross-sectional study of children/adolescents with and without non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to compare the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes, and to examine the role of abnormal glucose tolerance as a predictor of liver disease severity.

PARAGRAPH

We recruited a cohort of 599 Caucasian children/adolescents with biopsy-proven NAFLD, and 118 children/adolescents without NAFLD, who were selected to be similar for age, sex, body mass index and waist circumference to those with NAFLD.

The diagnosis of prediabetes and diabetes was based on either hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose or 2 h post-load glucose concentrations.

PARAGRAPH

Children/adolescents with NAFLD had a significantly higher prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance (prediabetes or diabetes) than those without NAFLD (20.6% vs. 11%, p = 0.02).

In particular, 124 (20.6%) children/adolescents with NAFLD had abnormal glucose tolerance, with 19.8% (n = 119) satisfying the diagnostic criteria for prediabetes and 0.8% (n = 5) satisfying the criteria for diabetes.

The combined presence of prediabetes and diabetes was associated with a nearly 2.2-fold increased risk of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH; unadjusted odds ratio 2.19; 95% CI 1.47–3.29; p <0.001).

However, this association was attenuated (but remained significant) after adjustment for age, sex, waist circumference (adjusted odds ratio 1.69, 95% CI 1.06–2.69, p = 0.032), and the PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism.

Both this PNPLA3 polymorphism and waist circumference were strongly associated with NASH.

PARAGRAPH

Abnormal glucose tolerance (especially prediabetes) is highly prevalent among children/adolescents with biopsy-proven NAFLD.

These children also have a higher risk of NASH, though central adiposity is the factor that is most strongly associated with NASH.
