TITLE

Shp2 deletion in hepatocytes suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis driven by oncogenic Î²-Catenin, PIK3CA and MET

PARAGRAPH

Primary liver cancer is a malignant disease with poor prognosis, largely because there are limited systemic therapies available.

We show here that a cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 is required for liver tumorigenesis.

This tumorigenesis is driven by two oncoproteins that are implicated in human liver cancer.

This, together with our previous studies, uncovers the complexity of liver tumorigenesis, by elucidating the pro- and anti-tumor effects of Shp2 in mouse models.

This data can be used to guide new therapies.
