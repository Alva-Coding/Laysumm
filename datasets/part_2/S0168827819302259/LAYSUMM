TITLE

Pluripotent stem cell-derived bile canaliculi-forming hepatocytes to study genetic liver diseases involving hepatocyte polarity

PARAGRAPH

This study demonstrates that cells that are isolated from urine can be reprogrammed in a dish towards hepatocytes that display architectural characteristics similar to those seen in the intact liver.

The application of this methodology to cells from patients diagnosed with inherited copper metabolism-related liver diseases (that is, Wilson disease and MEDNIK syndrome) revealed unexpected and novel insights into patient mutation-specific disease mechanisms and drug responses.
