TITLE

Outcomes of treatment for hepatitis C in prisoners using a nurse-led, statewide model of care

PARAGRAPH

There is a high burden of hepatitis C infection among prisoners worldwide.

Prisoners who continue to inject drugs are also at risk of developing new infections.

For this reason, the prison setting provides an opportunity to treat those people at greatest risk of infection and to stop transmission to others.

We developed a new method of providing hepatitis C treatment to prisoners, in which nurses rather than doctors assessed prisoners locally at each prison site.

Treatment was safe and most prisoners were cured.

Such programs will contribute greatly to achieving the World Health Organizationâ€™s hepatitis C elimination goals.
