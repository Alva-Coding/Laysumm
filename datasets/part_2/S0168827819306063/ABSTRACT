ABSTRACT

TITLE

Non-invasive prediction of liver-related events in patients with HCV-associated compensated advanced chronic liver disease after oral antivirals

PARAGRAPH

It is important to know which patients with hepatitis C are likely to develop liver-related complications after achieving a sustained virological response (SVR) to direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy.

We aimed to describe the incidence of liver-related events in a population of patients with HCV-associated compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD) who achieved SVR and to identify non-invasive parameters that predict the occurrence of liver-related events.

PARAGRAPH

This 2-center prospective study included 572 patients with cACLD who had been treated with DAAs and had achieved SVR.

Patients had liver stiffness measurement (LSM) ≥10 kPa at baseline and had never decompensated (Child-Pugh class A).

Laboratory work-up and LSM were performed at baseline and at 1 year of follow-up.

PARAGRAPH

The median follow-up was 2.8 years during which 32 patients (5.6%) presented with a liver-related event.

The incidence rate (IR) of portal hypertension-related decompensation was 0.34/100 patient-years.

These patients all had baseline LSM >20 kPa, and LSM did not improve during follow-up in 4 out of 5 of them.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurred in 25 patients (IR 1.5/100 patient-years).

Albumin levels at follow-up (hazard ratio [HR] 0.08; 95% CI 0.02–0.25) and LSM <10 kPa at follow-up (HR 0.33; 95% CI 0.11–0.96) were independently associated with the risk of HCC.

Combining both predictors identified 2 groups with differing risk of HCC occurrence: those with LSM ≥20 kPa at follow-up or those with LSM between 10–20 kPa and albumin levels <4.4 g/dl were at the highest risk (IR ≥1.9/100 patient-years).

Visual nomograms predicting HCC risk based on LSM and albumin at 1 year of follow-up were constructed.

PARAGRAPH

In patients with HCV-related cACLD who have achieved SVR with DAAs, HCC is the most frequent liver-related event.

Both albumin levels and LSM are useful for stratifying patients based on their risk of developing HCC during follow-up.
