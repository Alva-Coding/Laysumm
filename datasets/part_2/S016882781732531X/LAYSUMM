TITLE

Adult hepatocytes direct liver organogenesis through non-parenchymal cell recruitment in the kidney

PARAGRAPH

The role of adult hepatocytes at ectopic locations has not been clarified.

In this study, we demonstrated that engrafted hepatocytes in the kidney proliferated, recruited non-parenchymal cells from host tissues including bone marrow, and finally created an organ-sized, complex liver system that exhibited liver-specific architectures and functions.

Our results revealed previously undescribed functions of hepatocytes to direct liver organogenesis through non-parenchymal cell recruitment and organize multiple cell types into a complex 3D liver at ectopic sites.
