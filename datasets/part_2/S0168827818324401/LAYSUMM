TITLE

Healthcare resource utilization and costs by disease severity in an insured national sample of US patients with chronic hepatitis B

PARAGRAPH

Hepatitis B virus can be a progressive disease leading to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplant, and death.

These progressive disease states are associated with a higher rate of hospitalizations, emergency room visits, outpatient visits, and costs compared to similar patients without hepatitis B.

The most ill patients have the highest costs, but even patients who are less sick experience higher costs than patients without hepatitis B.
