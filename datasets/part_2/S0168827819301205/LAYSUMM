TITLE

Identification of a quadruple mutation that confers tenofovir resistance in chronic hepatitis B patients

PARAGRAPH

Tenofovir is the most potent nucleotide analogue for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection and there has been no hepatitis B virus mutation that confers >10-fold resistance to tenofovir up to 8â€¯years.

Herein, we identified, for the first time, a quadruple mutation that conferred 15.3-fold (IC50) and 26.3-fold (IC90) resistance to tenofovir in 2 patients who experienced viral breakthrough during tenofovir treatment.
