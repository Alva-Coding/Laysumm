TITLE

Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks in genotype 1–4 HCV-infected liver transplant recipients

PARAGRAPH

Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is a combination of two drugs in one tablet that is approved for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

When patients with chronic HCV infection receive a liver transplant, the HCV infection usually recurs, and damages the transplanted liver.

This study tested the effects of 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment in patients who had HCV recurrence after a liver transplant.

Three months following the end of treatment, 96% of patients were cured of HCV infection.
