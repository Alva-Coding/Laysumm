TITLE

Hepatovirus 3ABC proteases and evolution of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)

PARAGRAPH

Hepatitis A virus, a common cause of acute hepatitis globally, is likely to have evolved from a virus that jumped from a rodent species to humans within the last 10â€“12 thousand years.

Here we show that distantly related hepatoviruses, that infect bats and rodents today, express proteases that disrupt innate antiviral responses in human cells.

This conserved attribute of hepatoviruses may have contributed to that ancient host species shift.
