TITLE

The Candida albicans exotoxin candidalysin promotes alcohol-associated liver disease

PARAGRAPH

Candidalysin is a peptide toxin secreted by the commensal gut fungus Candida albicans.

Candidalysin enhances alcohol-associated liver disease independently of the Î²-glucan receptor CLEC7A on bone marrow-derived cells in mice without affecting intestinal permeability.

Candidalysin is cytotoxic to primary hepatocytes, indicating a direct role of candidalysin on ethanol-induced liver disease.

Candidalysin might be an effective target for therapy in patients with alcohol-associated liver disease.
