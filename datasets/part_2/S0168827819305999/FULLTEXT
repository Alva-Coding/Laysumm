TITLE

The Candida albicans exotoxin candidalysin promotes alcohol-associated liver disease

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Alcohol-associated liver disease is one of the most prevalent liver diseases worldwide,1 and the leading cause of liver transplantation in the US.2

Alcohol-related liver disease is associated with changes in the intestinal microbiota.

Gut dysbiosis induces intestinal inflammation and gut barrier dysfunction, which allows viable bacteria, bacterial (such as lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) and fungal products (such as β-glucan) to translocate to the liver.

Bacteria and microbial products bind to pathogen recognition receptors causing an inflammatory response driven by resident Kupffer cells and an infiltration of macrophages.

Although many efforts have been made to evaluate the role of the bacterial microbiota in alcohol-associated liver disease, the interaction between fungi and their host, and especially their contribution to alcohol-associated liver disease remains poorly understood.

We have shown that β-glucan, a cell wall component of many commensal fungi, binds to C-type lectin domain family 7 member A (CLEC7A; also known as DECTIN1) on hepatic macrophages to release interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and increase ethanol-induced liver disease in mice.3

PARAGRAPH

The yeast Candida albicans (C. albicans) normally resides as a harmless commensal in the human intestinal tract but can translocate from the gut into the bloodstream in predisposed individuals, such as immunocompromised patients.4

Its virulence partly depends on the transition from yeast to hyphal growth forms.5

Recent studies revealed that Ece1, the product of the gene extent of cell elongation 1 (ECE1), is critical for mucosal pathogenesis of C. albicans.6

Ece1 is a polyprotein consisting of 8 distinct peptides processed by the sequential activities of the serine proteases Kex2 and Kex16 (Fig. S1).

Among them, Ece1-III 62-92K, also named candidalysin, is a secreted cytolytic peptide (exotoxin) that is important for epithelial cell damage in the host.6

Candidalysin can damage epithelial mucosa directly, but also induces a danger response signaling pathway via c-Fos and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and triggers inflammatory cytokine responses (including IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-8).6–8

We have previously demonstrated that patients with alcohol use disorder had increased fecal proportions of Candida spp, including C. albicans, compared to non-alcoholic controls.

Whether intestinal overgrowth of C. albicans contributes to alcohol-associated liver disease beyond increasing systemic β-glucan levels is not known.

In this study, we evaluate the effect of candidalysin on promoting alcohol-associated liver disease.

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Patients

PARAGRAPH

We evaluated 11 individuals without alcohol use disorder (controls; social drinkers consuming less than 20 g/day), 42 patients with alcohol use disorder, and 91 patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

Patients with alcohol use disorder fulfilling the DSM IV criteria9 of alcohol dependence and with active alcohol consumption (self-reported >60 g/day) presented with various stages of liver disease (15% had advanced F3/4 fibrosis based on fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4);10 Table S1).

Patients with alcohol use disorder were recruited from an alcohol withdrawal unit where they followed a detoxification and rehabilitation program.

Controls or patients with alcohol use disorder did not take antibiotics or immunosuppressive medication during the 2 months preceding enrollment.

Other exclusion criteria were diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, known liver disease of any other etiology, and clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary or renal comorbidities.

Patients with alcoholic hepatitis were enrolled from the InTeam Consortium (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier number: NCT02075918) from 12 participating centers in the US, Mexico, Canada, United Kingdom, France and Spain.

Inclusion criteria were: i) active alcohol abuse (>50 g/day for men and >40 g/day for women) in the last 3 months, ii) aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and total bilirubin >3 mg/dl in the past 3 months, iii) liver biopsy and/or clinical picture consistent with alcoholic hepatitis.

Exclusion criteria were: i) autoimmune liver disease (ANA >1/320), ii) chronic viral hepatitis, iii) hepatocellular carcinoma, iv) complete portal vein thrombosis, v) extrahepatic terminal disease, vi) pregnancy, and vii) lack of signed informed consent.11

In all patients, the clinical picture was consistent with alcoholic hepatitis and in patients who underwent liver biopsy, the histology was in line with the diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis.

Liver biopsies were only done if clinically indicated as part of routine clinical care for the diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis.

For 3 patients who underwent liver transplantation, the transplantation date was considered as the date of death.

Patients were censored at the time point they were last seen alive.

Baseline characteristics are shown in Table S1 and S2.

Differences in body mass index are likely explained by the presence of ascites in 68% (n = 61) of patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

Fresh feces from healthy controls or patients were collected, immediately frozen and stored in −80 °C freezer until experiments were performed.

Fungal culture and quantitative PCR (qPCR) to test genomic DNA for total fungi, C. albicans and ECE1 was performed from fecal samples.

The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was calculated from all patients with alcoholic hepatitis from whom bilirubin level, international normalized ratio (INR), and creatinine level were available.

The protocol was designed according to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki as reflected in a priori approval by the Ethics Committee of each participating center and patients were enrolled after written informed consent was obtained from each patient.

SECTION

Mice

PARAGRAPH

C57BL/6 male mice were purchased from Charles River and used in all described experiments.

Clec7a−/− mice on a C57BL/6 background have been described.3

Heterozygous mice were used for breeding to generate wild-type and Clec7a deficient littermates.

PARAGRAPH

Male mice (8–12 weeks) were subjected to either chronic-plus-binge ethanol diet model (NIAAA model)12 or a chronic Lieber-DeCarli diet model for 8 weeks as previously described.3

For the chronic-plus-binge ethanol diet model, mice were fed the Lieber-DeCarli diet for 15 days.

The caloric intake from ethanol was 0% on days 1–5 and 36% from day 6 until the end.

At day 16, mice were gavaged with 1 dose of ethanol (5 g/kg bodyweight) in the morning and sacrificed 9 h later.

Pair-fed control mice received a diet with an isocaloric substitution of dextrose.

For the chronic Lieber-DeCarli feeding model, the caloric intake from ethanol was 0 on day 1, 10% of total calories on days 2 and 3, 20% on days 4 and 5, 30% from day 6 until the end of 6 weeks, and 36% for the last 2 weeks.

Control mice received an isocaloric amount of iso-maltose instead of ethanol.

Antibiotic treatment was started at day 1 of ethanol feeding, and mice were gavaged daily until harvesting.

The composition of the antibiotic mixture has been described (Polymyxin B [150 mg/kg of body weight] and Neomycin [200 mg/kg of body weight]).13

PARAGRAPH

To evaluate the effect of candidalysin on liver disease, C57BL/6 male mice (control diet: n = 5–8/group; ethanol diet: n = 12–14/group) were gavaged with 108 colony forming units (CFUs) of 4 different C. albicans strains (wild-type, M1477; ece1Δ/Δ, M2057; ece1Δ/Δ + ECE1Δ184–279, M2174; ece1Δ/Δ + ECE1, M2059)6 or PBS as vehicle control every third day starting from day 6 to day 15 of the chronic-plus-binge ethanol diet model.

As described,6 C. albicans was deleted for both copies of ECE1 (ece1Δ/Δ) and restored with 1 full-length allele (ece1Δ/Δ+ECE1) or 1 mutant allele lacking the candidalysin-encoding region of ECE1 (ece1Δ/Δ+ECE1Δ184-279).

PARAGRAPH

Bone marrow chimeric mice were generated as previously described.3

In brief, C57BL/6 recipient male mice were given lethal doses of radiation (650 rad) twice, using a 137Cs source.

Clec7a−/− male mice were used as bone marrow donors.

Two weeks after bone marrow transplantation, mice were given intraperitoneal injections of 200 μl clodronate liposomes (5 mg/ml; Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, Netherlands) to deplete radio-resistant Kupffer cells.

Chimeric mice (male, n = 10–11/group) were subjected to the chronic-plus-binge ethanol diet model 4 weeks after bone marrow transplantation.

PARAGRAPH

To determine the effect of candidalysin on intestinal permeability, C57BL/6 male mice (control diet: n = 5–6/group; ethanol diet: n = 5–6/group) were gavaged with PBS as vehicle control, 108 CFUs of wild-type C. albicans or ece1Δ/Δ C. albicans every third day starting from day 6 to day 15 using the chronic-plus-binge ethanol diet model.

At day 16, mice were gavaged with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran (4 kDa, Sigma) (200 μl, 100 mg/ml) 1 h after binge and blood was harvested after 4 h.

PARAGRAPH

All mice were housed under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions in a standard environment with a 12 h light–dark cycle at the animal facilities of University of California, San Diego under protocol S09042.

Animal studies were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, San Diego.

Quantitative PCR and reverse transcription quantitative PCR

PARAGRAPH

For qPCR, fungal genomic DNA was extracted from human stool samples as described.3

Published primer sequences for fungal 18S rRNA gene,14 C. albicans internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene,15 ECE1 gene6 and SEL1 gene16 were used (Table S3).

For reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), AML12 cellular and mouse liver RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) and cDNA was then synthesized using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (ABI) to determine AML12 cellular and hepatic gene expression.

Primer sequences for mouse genes were originally obtained from NIH qPrimerDepot (Table S3).

qPCR and RT-qPCR were performed with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) using a StepOnePlus thermocycler (ABI) real-time PCR system.

The RT-qPCR values of cellular and mouse genes were normalized to 18S.

Cellular gene expression data was expressed relative to the level of blank control-treated cells.

Mouse gene expression data was expressed relative to the level of control-fed PBS-treated mice.

SECTION

Fecal fungi

PARAGRAPH

To determine the number of fungal CFUs in human stool samples, 50 to 300 mg of feces was resuspended into 500 μl PBS and serial dilutions were then made, followed by plating 100 μl onto a YPD agar plate with antibiotics (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% D-glucose, 1.5% agar, 100 μg/ml gentamicin and 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol).

Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. Colony numbers of each sample were then counted and CFUs were normalized to weight of feces.

Each colony was assessed for the presence of fungus or C. albicans by qPCR using specific primers against fungal 18S rRNA gene or C. albicans ITS gene, respectively.

Each colony was also assessed by qPCR to determine ECE1 positivity using specific primers.

PARAGRAPH

To determine the number of fungal CFUs in mouse feces, 10 to 30 mg of feces were resuspended into 500 μl PBS and serial dilutions were made, followed by plating 100 μl onto YPD agar plate with antibiotics.

Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. Colony numbers of each sample were then counted and CFUs were normalized to weight of feces.

Fungi, C. albicans, ECE1 and SEL1 presence were assessed by qPCR.

SECTION

C. albicans culture

PARAGRAPH

C. albicans strains were grown in YPD broth with antibiotics (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% D-glucose, 100 μg/ml gentamicin and 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol) and incubated at 30 °C with shaking at 150 rpm for 20 h. Cell density was analyzed by measuring optical density at 600 nm in a microplate reader (Molecular Devices).

Cells from YPD broth were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS and adjusted to the required cell density.

SECTION

Biochemical assays

PARAGRAPH

Serum levels of ALT were measured using the Infinity ALT kit (Thermo Scientific).

Hepatic triglyceride levels were measured using the Triglyceride Liquid Reagents Kit (Pointe Scientific).

Serum levels of ethanol were measured using the Ethanol Assay Kit (BioVision).

Serum levels of intestinal fatty-acid binding protein (IFABP) were measured using the iFABP ELISA kit (MyBioSource).

Serum levels of zonulin were measured using the Human Zonulin ELISA Kit (MyBioSource).17

SECTION

Staining procedures

PARAGRAPH

To determine the accumulation of hepatic lipids, liver sections were embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound; 8 μm frozen sections were then cut and stained with Oil Red O (Sigma-Aldrich).

Representative pictures from each group of mice are shown in each figure.

SECTION

FITC-dextran permeability assay

PARAGRAPH

Intestinal permeability was assessed by oral gavage of FITC-dextran (4 kDa; Sigma), a non-metabolizable macromolecule that is used as a permeability probe.18,19

Serum concentration of FITC-dextran was determined using a fluorimeter with an excitation wavelength at 490 nm and an emission wavelength at 530 nm, followed by calculations using serial dilutions of FITC-dextran as standards.

SECTION

Mouse cell culture studies

PARAGRAPH

Primary hepatocytes were isolated from C57BL/6 male mice (n = 4–7/group) as described.20

Cells were seeded on plates coated with rat collagen type I and cultured for 4 h in DMEM-F12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 1% (v/v) insulin-transferrin-selenium (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 40 ng/ml dexamethasone (MP Biomedicals), 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gemini Bio-Products), and an antibiotic-antimycotic mix (CoreBio).

Following an overnight starvation in medium without FBS, hepatocytes were stimulated with different concentrations (0.6 µM and 3 µM) of candidalysin for 24 h.6 Ece1-VII was used as negative control (0.6 µM and 3 µM).

Culture medium was used as blank control.

AML12 (immortalized mouse hepatocyte) cells were seeded and cultured in the same medium as primary hepatocytes (as described above) 24 h prior to transfection.

AML12 cells were transfected with siRNA for mouse toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 (25 nM; set of 4 siRNAs, Dharmacon) or control siRNA (siGLO Green Transfection Indicator, Dharmacon), using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were serum starved for 2 h and treated with candidalysin (15 µM), negative control (15 µM) or blank control for 24 h.

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocyte cytotoxicity was measured using the Pierce™ lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Hepatocyte viability was determined by adding 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5′-diphenyltetrazolium bromide solution (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich, final concentration 0.3 mg/ml) into cell culture plates and incubated in the dark for 2 h.

The medium was then removed and dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to dissolve the formazan.

Formazan concentration was determined by absorbance at 550 nm and the survival percentage was calculated accordingly (the mean survival rate of hepatocytes incubated with culture medium alone was set as 100%).

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

All data were expressed as mean ± SE unless otherwise specified.

In mouse and cell culture experiments, for comparisons of >2 groups within 1 experimental setting, 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used followed by the Tukey’s post hoc test.

For comparisons of >2 groups within 2 experimental settings, a 2-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey’s post hoc test was used.

For the human cohort, comparisons of baseline characteristics between the 3 groups were conducted using 1-way ANOVA with the Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons for continuous variables and Chi-squared tests for categorical variables.

A Kruskal-Wallis test with the Dunn’s post hoc test was used to compare the mean number of fungal colonies in feces among different groups.

A 2-proportion z test followed by false discovery rate procedures was used to evaluate the percentage of individuals carrying fungi or ECE1 among different groups.

Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to detect associations of candidalysin positivity with 90-day mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

Patients that were lost to follow-up were censored at the day they were last seen alive.

Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine associations of candidalysin and clinical parameters.

PARAGRAPH

Statistical analyses were performed using the statistical software R (V.3.5.1, 2018 the R Foundation for Statistical Computing) and GraphPad Prism (V.6.01).

A p value <0.05 was considered significant.

SECTION

Results

SECTION

Patients with alcoholic hepatitis have increased fecal numbers of candidalysin-positive C. albicans

PARAGRAPH

C. albicans is a commensal fungus of the human gut flora.

Using ITS sequencing we showed that the relative proportions of C. albicans increased in patients with alcohol use disorder.3

To determine quantitative differences of viable fungi in the fecal mycobiome, we performed fungal cultures of stool samples from non-alcoholic controls (controls, n = 11), patients with alcohol use disorder (n = 42) and patients with alcoholic hepatitis (n = 91).

Each colony was further assessed for the presence of fungi or C. albicans by qPCR using specific primers against fungi or C. albicans.

Fecal samples from patients with alcoholic hepatitis grew significantly more colonies of fungi or C. albicans compared to cultures from patients with alcohol use disorder and controls (Fig. 1A, B).

Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of patients with alcoholic hepatitis had positive cultures for fungi or C. albicans than patients with alcohol use disorder (Fig. 1C, D).

PARAGRAPH

We next sought to determine if ECE1, the gene encoding the C. albicans exotoxin candidalysin, was also increased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

A total of 30.77% of patients with alcoholic hepatitis tested positive for ECE1, while in patients with alcohol use disorder, this proportion was significantly lower (Fig. 1E).

Taken together, ECE1, the gene encoding candidalysin, was more abundant in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

SECTION

Candidalysin exacerbates ethanol-induced liver disease

PARAGRAPH

We confirmed that chronic ethanol administration is associated with an increase of intestinal fungi in mice3 (Fig. S2).

However, we could not detect C. albicans or ECE1 in mice in the chronic-plus-binge ethanol diet model12 or the chronic Lieber-DeCarli model for 8 weeks,3 consistent with a published report.21

This indicates that C. albicans does not normally colonize the gastrointestinal mucosa of mice, or that the level of C. albicans cells or ECE1 genes was below the detection limit of fungal cultures or nucleic acid amplification.

PARAGRAPH

To study the role of candidalysin-positive C. albicans for alcohol-associated liver disease, we colonized mice by repeated oral gavage of C. albicans (108 CFUs every third day) during ethanol feeding.

The average amount of C. albicans in mouse feces is 1.5 × 105 CFU/g feces (24 h following gavage) (Fig. S3), which is similar to the C. albicans amount in feces from patients with alcoholic hepatitis (4.7 × 105 CFU/g feces) (Fig. 1B).

Compared to vehicle (PBS)-treated mice, mice colonized with wild-type C. albicans displayed more severe ethanol-associated liver injury, indicated by elevated levels of serum ALT (Fig. 2A) and increased hepatic steatosis (Fig. 2B,C).

Those animals also showed more liver inflammation, with higher expression of genes Il1b, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (Cxcl1) and Cxcl2, which encode inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Fig. 2D-F).

To determine if this disease exacerbation effect depends on ECE1, we colonized mice with C. albicans strain carrying an ECE1 gene deletion (ece1Δ/Δ).

These mice had less severe ethanol-associated liver injury, steatosis and inflammation (Fig. 2A-F).

Re-introducing ECE1 back into the ece1Δ/Δ strain (ece1Δ/Δ + ECE1) and colonizing mice with this strain, resulted in comparable levels of liver injury, steatosis and inflammation as in mice colonized with wild-type C. albicans following ethanol administration (Fig. 2A-F).

These results indicate that the gene product of ECE1 is important for C. albicans to enhance ethanol-induced liver disease.

PARAGRAPH

ECE1 encodes for a polyprotein composed of 8 different peptides6 (Fig. S1).

Candidalysin is among them and is a secreted cytolytic peptide exotoxin.6

To test whether candidalysin is responsible for increased ethanol-induced disease mediated by ECE1, we colonized mice with a C. albicans strain carrying a deletion of the Ece1-III62–93 candidalysin-encoding region (ece1Δ/Δ + ECE1Δ184–279), thus not producing candidalysin.

These mice showed similar ethanol-induced liver disease compared to mice colonized with the ece1Δ/Δ C. albicans strain (Fig. 2A-F), indicating that candidalysin is necessary for exacerbation of ethanol-induced liver disease by C. albicans.

PARAGRAPH

In addition, candidalysin is associated with increased mortality.

Mice colonized with candidalysin-positive strains had a significant higher mortality rate compared to mice colonized with candidalysin-negative strains (Fig. S4).

Importantly, none of the C. albicans strains affected intestinal absorption or hepatic metabolism of ethanol, as serum levels of ethanol, as well as expression of hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (Adh1) and cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily E polypeptide 1 (Cyp2e1) (2 genes encoding the main hepatic enzymes that metabolize ethanol and convert it to acetaldehyde), did not differ significantly between mouse groups (Fig. 2G-I).

PARAGRAPH

Bacteria and fungi actively interact with each other in the gut.22

To test whether the effects of C. albicans on liver disease are affected by its interaction with bacteria, mice were treated with antibiotics to reduce the quantity of intestinal bacteria, and gavaged with wild-type C. albicans or vehicle (PBS).

Compared with antibiotic-plus-vehicle treated mice, mice receiving antibiotics plus wild-type C. albicans showed more severe ethanol-induced liver injury (Fig. S5A) and steatosis (Fig. S5B,C), indicating that bacteria-fungi interactions are not the major contributor to liver damage caused by C. albicans.

PARAGRAPH

Taken together, these results indicate that C. albicans producing candidalysin can enhance ethanol-associated liver disease and increase mortality in mice.

SECTION

Candidalysin exacerbates ethanol-induced steatohepatitis independent of the receptor CLEC7A on bone marrow-derived cells

PARAGRAPH

β-Glucan is the most abundant cell wall polysaccharide in most fungal species including C. albicans.23

CLEC7A is a pattern recognition receptor that recognizes a variety of β-glucans and thus activates host immune responses.24

CLEC7A is primarily expressed on myeloid cells25,26 and only expressed on Kupffer cells and macrophages in the liver.3

We have previously shown that loss of CLEC7A from Kupffer cells decreases ethanol-induced steatohepatitis.3

To investigate whether the disease promoting effect of C. albicans is mediated by CLEC7A signaling, we generated CLEC7A bone marrow chimeric mice using a combination of clodronate-mediated Kupffer cell depletion, irradiation, and bone marrow transplantation.3

Wild-type mice were transplanted with bone marrow cells from CLEC7A-deficient mice, which results in full reconstitution of Kupffer cells.3,27

Chimeric mice were colonized with wild-type C. albicans, ece1Δ/Δ C. albicans (ece1Δ/Δ) or vehicle (PBS) and subjected to the chronic-plus-binge ethanol diet model.

Chimeric mice with bone marrow-derived cells that lacked CLEC7A and were colonized with wild-type C. albicans showed more severe ethanol-induced liver injury (Fig. 3A), steatosis (Fig. 3B,C) and inflammation (Fig. 3D-F) compared with PBS-treated mice and mice colonized with the C. albicans strain carrying an ECE1 gene deletion.

No significant difference in serum ethanol level and hepatic expression of Adh1 and Cyp2e1 was observed among all groups (Fig. 3G-I).

These results indicate that C. albicans and candidalysin induce liver disease independently of CLEC7A signaling on Kupffer cells and other bone marrow-derived cells following ethanol administration.

SECTION

Candidalysin does not affect intestinal permeability

PARAGRAPH

In a cell culture system, candidalysin causes necrosis of intestinal epithelial cells, which is a key factor in subsequent fungal translocation of C. albicans through intestinal layers.28

To determine if candidalysin induces gut barrier dysfunction in vivo, we determined intestinal permeability by measuring recovery of indigested dextran.

In line with our previous report,29 intestinal permeability increased in mice fed an ethanol diet (Fig. 4A).

However, no significant difference was observed among mice colonized with wild-type C. albicans, ece1Δ/Δ C. albicans (ece1Δ/Δ) and vehicle (PBS) following ethanol administration (Fig. 4A).

Intestinal fatty-acid binding protein (IFABP) is specifically expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and released to the systemic circulation upon enterocyte damage.30

Intestinal epithelial damage was not different between groups as measured by ELISA for serum IFABP (Fig. 4B).

These results indicate that candidalysin does not cause measurable intestinal barrier disruption or enterocyte death in ethanol-fed mice.

SECTION

Candidalysin is cytotoxic to primary hepatocytes

PARAGRAPH

To further define a mechanism by which candidalysin enhances ethanol-induced liver disease, primary hepatocytes were isolated from mice fed an isocaloric control diet or subjected to the chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding model.

Cultured hepatocytes were incubated with pure bioactive candidalysin.

Candidalysin dose-dependently caused death of cultured hepatocytes compared with hepatocytes incubated with control peptide (Fig. 5).

Hepatocytes from ethanol-fed mice showed similar cytotoxicity compared to hepatocytes isolated from control diet-fed mice.

However, incubation with ethanol increased the candidalysin-induced cytotoxicity of hepatocytes (Fig. 5A,B).

These results indicate that candidalysin can damage hepatocytes directly and additional ethanol stimulation in vitro can increase the cytotoxic effect.

PARAGRAPH

Sel1, a small secreted cysteine-rich protein of C. albicans, is critical in mediating the effects of C. albicans on innate immune cells via activation of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling.16

Since candidalysin can also activate the MAPK/c-Fos/MAP kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP1) signaling pathway in epithelial cells,8 we tested whether the effects of candidalysin on liver injury and hepatocyte damage are modulated by Sel1.

We first tested the presence of SEL1 in the 4 strains of C. albicans used in this study.

All strains (wild-type, ece1Δ/Δ, ece1Δ/Δ + ECE1Δ184–279, and ece1Δ/Δ + ECE1) carried SEL1 (Fig. S6A).

We further assessed the presence of SEL1 in mouse feces after C. albicans gavage; SEL1 was detected in both groups of mice (treated with either wild-type or ece1Δ/Δ + ECE1Δ184–279C.

albicans) (Fig. S6B).

A recent study reported that SEL1 can trigger an inflammatory response through TLR2/4.16

To determine whether candidalysin causes hepatocyte damage via the Sel1-TLR2/4 pathway, we performed TLR2/4 knockdown using siRNA in a mouse hepatocyte cell line (AML12 cells) (Fig. S7A), and incubated these cells with pure bioactive candidalysin.

Candidalysin caused a cytotoxic effect on AML12 cells independent of TLR2/4 (Fig. S7B,C).

Our in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that candidalysin exerts its effects on hepatocytes and the liver independently of Sel1.

SECTION

Candidalysin is linked to the severity and mortality of alcoholic hepatitis

PARAGRAPH

Alcohol-associated liver disease can progress to alcoholic hepatitis, a severe form of liver disease with considerable morbidity and mortality.

We therefore analyzed clinical parameters and outcomes in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, who were positive for the candidalysin coding gene ECE1 in feces.

Patients with fecal samples containing genetic material for candidalysin had higher serum levels of zonulin (a surrogate marker for gut barrier dysfunction) compared with ECE1-negative patients (Fig. S8).

Compared to ECE1-negative patients, fecal patient samples containing genetic material for candidalysin had a higher MELD score (Fig. 6A).

In the univariate logistic regression analysis, the MELD score was significantly associated with detection of ECE1 (Table 1).

The detection of ECE1 was further associated with increased 90-day mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.01 (1.02–8.87, p = 0.046) (Table 2).

Importantly, 28.42% of ECE1-positive patients with alcoholic hepatitis died within 90 days of admission compared with 11.71% of ECE1-negative patients (Log-rank p = 0.044) (Fig. 6B).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Our previous study showed that patients with alcohol use disorder have higher intestinal proportions of C. albicans.

Whether this leads to more severe alcohol-associated liver disease, and the precise mechanism by which C. albicans promotes alcohol-associated liver disease, remain poorly understood.

Our current results link a specific fungal exotoxin with the progression of alcohol-associated liver disease.

Candidalysin, a cytotoxic peptide secreted by C. albicans, causes direct hepatocyte damage and exacerbates ethanol-induced liver disease in mice.

Fecal positivity for the candidalysin coding gene ECE1 is associated with more severe disease and mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

PARAGRAPH

Different forms of cell death contribute to the pathogenesis of alcohol-associated liver disease.31

Apoptosis of hepatocytes can be induced by organelle stress and cytokine receptor activation.31,32

It has also been shown that receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), RIP3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) trigger necroptosis of hepatocytes in alcohol-associated liver disease.31,33

Furthermore, hepatocytes undergo gasdermin-D mediated pyroptosis in patients with alcoholic hepatitis,34 indicating that different forms of hepatocellular death may exist/coexist based on the different microenvironment of cells.

Candidalysin was found to activate the MAPK/c-Fos/ MKP1 signaling pathway, resulting in the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-6 in epithelial cells.6–8

Our study confirmed that candidalysin increases hepatic levels of Il1b, Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 mRNAs in mice following ethanol administration.

These proinflammatory cytokines may further recruit immune cells and promote hepatocyte injury.

This might contribute to direct candidalysin-induced hepatocyte death.

Taken together, candidalysin might be able to induce multiple forms of hepatocellular death through different mechanisms, which deserve further investigation in the future.

PARAGRAPH

Our data indicate that candidalysin does not increase intestinal permeability or intestinal epithelial cell damage in mice fed ethanol.

C. albicans is larger in size than bacteria35 and seems to translocate predominantly via a transcellular route, and maybe to a lesser extent through the paracellular space of intestinal epithelial cells.28

Chronic ethanol diet is associated with increased intestinal permeability.36

Unlike what has been shown with bacteria, we have not been able to detect C. albicans in the liver of ethanol-fed mice by culture or by amplification of genetic material via qPCR.

We have confirmed that candidalysin-positive C. albicans could increase liver injury, steatosis and inflammation in mice fed an ethanol diet, but this injurious effect is absent in mice fed control diet.

Our clinical data showed that patients with fecal samples containing genetic material for candidalysin had increased gut permeability, higher MELD scores and higher 90-day mortality compared with ECE1-negative patients.

Thus, it is most likely that candidalysin produced in the intestinal lumen reaches the liver via increased intestinal permeability and exerts its effects directly on the liver.

A direct interaction between candidalysin and hepatocytes needs to be confirmed in future in vivo studies.

PARAGRAPH

Importantly, we have discovered a link between the abundance of the candidalysin gene ECE1 and the severity of disease in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

There is a positive correlation between ECE1 detection and MELD, and between ECE1 detection and patient mortality.

Although an independent and larger patient cohort is required to confirm our findings, fecal ECE1 detection might be useful as a non-invasive biomarker for predicting mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

Personalized diagnostics could be applied to identify patients colonized with candidalysin-positive C. albicans.

PARAGRAPH

In summary, our study shows that candidalysin promotes ethanol-induced liver disease in mice, as well as being associated with disease severity and mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

Effective methods such as antifungal drugs targeting C. albicans should be explored and considered as a therapeutic approach for patients with alcoholic hepatitis.
