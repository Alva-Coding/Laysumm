TITLE

Hsp72 protects against liver injury via attenuation of hepatocellular death, oxidative stress, and JNK signaling

PARAGRAPH

HSP72 constitutes a stress-inducible, protective protein.

Our data demonstrate that it is upregulated in patients with chronic hepatitis C and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

Moreover, Hsp72-overexpressing mice are protected from various forms of liver stress.
