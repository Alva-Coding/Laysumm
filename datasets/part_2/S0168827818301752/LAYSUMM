TITLE

A simple diet- and chemical-induced murine NASH model with rapid progression of steatohepatitis, fibrosis and liver cancer

PARAGRAPH

A carefully characterized model has been developed in mice that recapitulates the progressive stages of human fatty liver disease, from simple steatosis, to inflammation, fibrosis and cancer.

The functional pathways of gene expression and immune abnormalities in this model closely resemble human disease.

The ease and reproducibility of this model make it ideal to study disease pathogenesis and test new treatments.
