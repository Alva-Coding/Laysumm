TITLE

A simple diet- and chemical-induced murine NASH model with rapid progression of steatohepatitis, fibrosis and liver cancer

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a rising cause of chronic liver disease worldwide.

Although the majority of patients with NAFLD have only steatosis without progression, a sizeable fraction develop non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can lead to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and increased liver-related mortality.1

The prevalence of NAFLD in the US population is estimated at ∼24% (or ∼65 million) and up to a third of these individuals have NASH.2,3

The prevalence of NAFLD is steadily increasing in parallel with the rising prevalence of obesity.

NAFLD/NASH is already the third leading indication for liver transplantation, and the second leading cause of HCC requiring liver transplantation in the US,4 and it is likely to be the leading indication for transplantation by 2020.

PARAGRAPH

Histologically, NASH is characterized by the presence of steatosis, inflammation, hepatocyte injury (ballooning), and/or fibrosis.1

Key risk factors include diabetes, obesity, age, ethnicity, gender, and genetic polymorphisms that can affect natural history and disease progression.

These divergent risk factors reflect the complex and heterogeneous nature of the disease.

PARAGRAPH

Despite the growing public health impact of NASH, treatment options remain limited and there are no FDA-approved therapies.

One obstacle to drug development has been the paucity of standardized and relevant animal models.

Although there are several dietary and genetic models of NASH described, few, if any, replicate all the metabolic, histologic and genetic features of the human disease.5

Mice are generally preferable because they are easy to handle and suitable for drug testing.

Also, dietary models are preferred because genetic models often induce NASH by manipulating one specific molecule/pathway.

For example, a methionine/choline-deficient (MCD) diet has traditionally been used to induce histological features of NASH.

However, mice treated with MCD diet lose body weight, and do not develop insulin resistance and related co-morbidities.6,7

A western diet (WD), which is high-fat, high-fructose and high-cholesterol, mimics fast food style diets that have been implicated in NASH pathogenesis in humans.8

WD treatment induces obesity and insulin resistance in addition to NASH histology.

However, the WD-based models do not fully progress to severe steatohepatitis and advanced fibrosis, even after long-term feeding for 25 to 52 weeks.8,9

PARAGRAPH

Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) has been widely used for decades to induce liver injury and fibrosis in mice.10

A previous report has suggested that multiple administrations of CCl4 with a high-fat diet induce oxidative stress that triggers inflammation and apoptosis, leading to the development of fibrosis in mice.11

Also, combined chronic treatment with CCl4 and choline-deficient L-amino-acid-defined-diet for up to nine months can induce NASH with fibrosis, and HCC.12

However, these reports have lacked blinded quantitative assessment of the three features of the NAFLD activity score, which is used routinely in human studies (steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning); moreover, the fibrosis stages have not been quantified or fully characterized.

Importantly, the effects of chronic treatment with CCl4 combined with a WD have not been assessed as a potential model for NASH.

PARAGRAPH

Herein, we have sought to establish a murine NASH model which leads to rapid and reproducible progression of steatohepatitis, with extensive fibrosis and HCC, and closely replicates the transcriptomic hallmarks of human NASH.

Using a WD and CCl4 we have generated all the key metabolic and histologic features of human NASH within 12 weeks, with consistent development of HCC by 24 weeks.

Materials and methods

SECTION

Animals

PARAGRAPH

Male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor).

Five mice per cage were housed in a 12 h light – 12 h dark cycle.

All procedures were performed according to protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (IACUC-2015-0112).

SECTION

Dietary and CCl4 treatment

PARAGRAPH

Mice (nine weeks old) were fed a normal chow diet (ND, Lab diet, Rodent diet 20, #5053) and normal tap water or WD containing 21.1% fat, 41% Sucrose, and 1.25% Cholesterol by weight (Teklad diets, TD.

120528) and a high sugar solution (23.1 g/L d-fructose (Sigma-Aldrich, F0127) and 18.9 g/L d-glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, G8270).

CCl4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 289116-100ML) at the dose of 0.2 µl (0.32 µg)/g of body weight, which is much lower than the dose that is usually given for fibrosis induction with CCl4 alone,10 or its control vehicle, corn oil was injected intra-peritoneally once per week, starting simultaneously with the diet administration.

Experimental groups were as follows: ND and oil (ND/Oil, five mice per group), WD and oil (WD/Oil, 10 mice per group), ND and CCl4 (ND/CCl4, 10 mice per group), and WD and CCl4 (WD/CCl4, nine mice for 12 weeks and 10 mice for 24 weeks) treatment for 12 and 24 weeks.

Mice were euthanized at 12 and 24 weeks by exsanguination after ketamine and xylazine anesthesia.

Liver and serum samples were collected and processed for histological, serological and gene expression analysis.

SECTION

Liver histology

PARAGRAPH

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for assessment of liver histology, with Sirius Red (Sigma, 365548-5G)/Fast Green (Sigma, F258) for assessment of fibrosis, and with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) for assessment of glycogen accumulation.

NAFLD activity score and fibrosis stage were evaluated by an expert pathologist according to the NASH CRN scoring system.13

The histological scoring was performed blinded, with no knowledge by the pathologist of the treatment(s) received.

SECTION

Liver histology of patients with NASH

PARAGRAPH

Anonymized and de-identified liver sections from four adult patients with NASH were analyzed.

Pictures were taken from representative areas showing steatosis, lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning with Mallory-Denk bodies in consultation with a pathologist.

SECTION

Immunohistochemistry

PARAGRAPH

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver sections were incubated with primary antibodies against α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) (Abcam, ab5694), desmin (Abcam, ab15200), cytokeratin-19 (CK-19) (Abcam, ab15463), and Ki67 (Abcam, ab15580).

Quantitative morphometry was performed using computerized Life Science morphometry system (BIOQUANT) on equal number of pictures per mouse (10 or 20 images) under constant magnification (100× or 200× magnification) as indicated in the respective experiment.

Immunofluorescence analysis for MIC1-1C3 (Thermoscientific #MA5-16136) was performed on fresh frozen liver sections which were fixed with acetone and incubated with MIC1-1C3 antibody and fluorescently-labeled secondary antibody.

CD3 (Leica, PA0122), CD4 (Leica, PA0427), CD8 (Leica, PA0183), and CK8/18 (Dako, IR094) immunostainings were performed on randomly selected livers from 12-week and/or 24-week old mice.

Four-micron thick sections were stained using the Leica AutoStainer Universal Staining System.

SECTION

Immunoblotting

PARAGRAPH

Fresh frozen livers were homogenized using TissueLyser (Qiagen) in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors (Thermoscientific Pierce complete protease inhibitors, 1 tablet/10 ml RIPA buffer).

Bradford protein quantification was performed (Biorad Protein assay) and 30 µg protein analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies to collagen 1 (Bioss, bs10423R), αSMA (Abcam, ab5694) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EMD Millipore, CB1001).

SECTION

Serum analysis

PARAGRAPH

Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured using VITROS 5,1 FS (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics).

Non-fasting plasma insulin was measured with the Ultrasensitive Mouse Insulin ELISA kit (Crystal Chem, 90080) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Non-fasting blood glucose was assayed with the One Touch Ultra (Life Scan).

In animals receiving CCl4, blood was analyzed seven days after the most recent administration.

Homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance and QUICKI were calculated as described.14,15

SECTION

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction

PARAGRAPH

RNA was extracted from liver tissues and purified (RNeasy Kit, Qiagen), and 1 µg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA using RNA to cDNA EcoDry™ (Clontech, 639548).

Expression levels were determined by quantitative PCR (iQ™ SYBR Green Supermix, Bio-Rad Laboratories, 1708884) on the LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche).

The relative expression of target genes was normalized by β-actin (Actb) expression as an internal control.

PARAGRAPH

β-actin was measured by using the 5′-GCTGTATTCCCCTCCATCGTG-3′, forward and 5′-CACGGTTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAG-3′, reverse primers.

Tgf-β (Tgfb1) was measured by using the 5′-TGACGTCACTGGAGTTGTACGG-3′, forward and 5′-GGTTCATGTCATGGATGGTGC-3′, reverse primers.

β-Pdgfr (Pdgfrb) was measured by using the 5′-ACTACATCTCCAAAGGCAGCACCT-3′, forward and 5′-TGTAGAACTGGTCGTTCATGGGCA-3′, reverse primers.

Collagen 1α1 (Col1a1) was measured by using the 5′-GTCCCTGAAGTCAGCTGCATA-3′, forward and 5′-TGGGACAGTCCAGTTCTTCAT-3′, reverse primers.

Timp-1 was measured by using the 5′-CAGTAAGGCCTGTAGCTGTGC-3′, forward and 5′-CTCGTTGATTTCTGGGGAAC-3′, reverse primers.

SECTION

Transcriptome profiling

PARAGRAPH

Global transcriptome profiling of the mouse liver and HCC tumor tissues was performed by RNA-Seq.

Briefly, sequencing library was prepared using 200 ng total RNA by TruSeq library prep kit (Illumina) following manufacturer’s protocol, and resulting data were preprocessed by our custom preprocessing pipeline.

Briefly, raw sequencing reads were aligned to mouse reference genome (mm10) by STAR 2-pass algorithm,16 and gene expression levels were calculated as counts per million normalized by trimmed mean of M-values method.17

The dataset is available at NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) accession number GSE99010.

SECTION

Bioinformatics data analysis

PARAGRAPH

Molecular pathway dysregulation in the liver tissues was determined by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA),18 surveying molecular pathway gene sets in Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) (www.broadinstitute.org/msigdb) (Table S1).

Cross-species comparison of transcriptomic dysregulation was performed in the space of molecular pathway gene sets from HALLMARK and KEGG databases19 and with statistically significant dysregulation defined as false discovery rate (FDR) <0.01 in either of the two human NASH liver transcriptome datasets: advanced (n = 30) vs. mild (n = 42) patients with NAFLD (GSE49541),20 and patients with NASH (n = 18) vs. healthy individuals (n = 14) (GSE48452).21

Dysregulation of the selected gene sets was similarly determined by GSEA in a panel of 16 previously published diet, chemical, and/or genetic NASH mouse models (Table S2), and similarity to the human datasets was determined by Euclidean distance and visualized as previously described.22

Similarity of HCC tumor transcriptome dysregulation to human HCC molecular subclasses was assessed by GSEA.23

Results

SECTION

Serum tests for liver injury and metabolism in mice treated with WD or WD/CCl4

PARAGRAPH

Mice treated with WD/Oil showed significant weight gain and adiposity compared to ND/Oil control mice (Fig. 1A).

CCl4 treatment decreased food intake (Fig. S2 A,B) and attenuated the body weight gain induced by WD feeding (Fig. 1A).

Whereas the ND/Oil or ND/CCl4 mouse groups did not develop increased liver weight, or liver to body weight ratio at 12 and 24 weeks, both these parameters were increased in the two WD treated groups (WD/Oil or WD/CCl4) (Fig. 1B and C).

The increased liver weight in WD/Oil or WD/CCl4 treated mice was accompanied by elevations of serum ALT and AST at 12 and 24 weeks.

In contrast to WD fed animals, ALT and AST were only modestly but not significantly increased by ND/CCl4 treatment at 12 and 24 weeks, indicating that while the NASH-related histologic features were amplified by the addition of CCl4, the level of hepatocellular injury as reflected in AST and ALT was not (Fig. 1D and E).

PARAGRAPH

There were no differences in blood glucose levels among four groups at 12 weeks (Fig. 1F).

However, insulin was significantly increased in mice treated with WD/Oil vs. ND/Oil at 12 weeks, suggesting that WD/Oil-treated mice might be insulin resistant, although this was not tested formally with insulin-clamp studies.

Although increased insulin was not observed in ND/CCl4 or WD/CCl4 treated mice (Fig. 1G), homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance and QUICKI14 were consistent with the presence of insulin resistance in all animals fed a WD.

The abnormalities were partially attenuated when CCl4 was added, yielding levels intermediate between WD alone and CCl4 alone (Fig. S1); these findings are consistent with transcriptomic data indicating engagement of insulin resistance pathways, described below.

Total serum cholesterol was significantly increased in mice treated with WD/Oil and WD/CCl4 at 12 and 24 weeks (Fig. 1H).

Caloric and food intake were stable across all groups through the duration of the study (Fig. S2A–B).

However, serum triglycerides were decreased in groups fed a WD compared to their respective controls (Fig. S2C).

SECTION

CCl4 treatment accelerates WD-induced steatohepatitis and fibrosis

PARAGRAPH

Representative pictures of H&E and Sirius Red staining from mice of each group are shown (Fig. 2A and B).

NAFLD activity score and fibrosis stage are described (Table 1).

WD/Oil or WD/CCl4 treatment induced macrovesicular and microvesicular steatosis at 12 and 24 weeks.

Most mice treated with WD/Oil, and all mice treated with WD/CCl4 exhibited grade 3 steatosis, while ND/Oil and ND/CCl4 treated mice did not develop steatosis.

WD/Oil treatment induced lobular inflammation at 12 weeks and 24 weeks.

CCl4 treatment exacerbated WD-induced lobular inflammation, which led to grade 2.6 (±0.2) at 12 weeks and 2.1 (±0.3) at 24 weeks.

Hepatocyte ballooning was observed at 12 weeks and 24 weeks by WD/Oil treatment.

CCl4 treatment promoted hepatocyte ballooning induced by WD, showing grade 2.0 (±0.0) at 12 weeks and 1.7 (±0.2) at 24 weeks.

To confirm that the appearance of these cells was consistent with ballooning and not glycogen accumulation, PAS staining was negative in ballooned hepatocytes (not shown).

PARAGRAPH

In mice treated with WD/Oil, NAFLD activity score was 5.5 (±0.4) at 12 weeks and 5.8 (±0.1) at 24 weeks.

CCl4 treatment further increased the NAFLD activity score attributable to WD, which resulted in 7.6 (±0.2) at 12 weeks and 6.8 (±0.4) at 24 weeks.

PARAGRAPH

Based on Sirius Red staining, fibrosis stage was 1.1 (±0.2) at 12 weeks and progressed to stage 2.1 (±0.3) at 24 weeks in mice treated with WD/Oil.

Remarkably, stage 3 bridging fibrosis developed at as early as 12 weeks in all mice treated with WD/CCl4.

Some mice further progressed to F4 cirrhosis at 24 weeks, with an average 3.6 (±0.2) of fibrosis stage.

Based on quantitative morphometry assessment of fibrotic tissue area, there was a trend towards increased collagen deposition in WD mice when CCl4 treatment was added (Fig. 2C and D), which was consistent with the histological scoring.

Overall, these results suggest that CCl4 treatment accelerated WD-induced progression of steatohepatitis and fibrosis.

PARAGRAPH

The liver histology of mice treated with WD/CCl4 for 24 weeks was compared to human patients with NASH.

Steatosis (Fig. 3A), lobular inflammation (Fig. 3B), and ballooning hepatocytes with Mallory-Denk bodies (Fig. 3C) resembled those of human patients with NASH.

SECTION

WD/CCl4 treatment promotes activation of HSCs

PARAGRAPH

Rapid and severe progression of fibrosis was a notable histological feature of mice treated with WD/CCl4.

Activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are a major source of extracellular matrix (ECM) in parenchymal liver disease including NASH,24 and CCl4 treatment significantly increased the intensity of desmin, a HSC marker, and αSMA, a marker of activated HSCs, on immunohistochemistry (IHC) following WD for 12 weeks (Fig. 4A–D).

At 24 weeks, there were no further increases in desmin- and αSMA-positive tissue area in WD/CCl4 treated mice (Fig. 4A–D), suggesting that HSCs might be activated earlier by WD/CCl4 treatment compared to WD/Oil or ND/CCl4 treatment.

Quantitative PCR confirmed that WD/Oil or WD/CCl4 treatment upregulated fibrogenic genes such as Collagen1α1, β-Pdgfr, Tgf-β and Timp-1 (Fig. S3A–D).

These data were complemented by evidence of increased Collagen1 and αSMA expression by immunoblotting of whole liver lysates at 12 weeks (Fig. S4).

SECTION

WD/CCl4 treatment induced ductular reaction and hepatocyte proliferation

PARAGRAPH

Ductular reaction (DR) is a reactive lesion at the portal tract defined by the proliferation of small biliary ductules containing hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs), which could be the source of regenerating hepatocytes, as well as cholangiocytes.25

In patients with NASH, expansion of HPCs and the extent of ductular reaction are correlated with fibrosis stage.25,26

IHC for CK-19, a marker for cholangiocytes which can also stain HPCs, was more pronounced in WD/CCl4-treated mice than in WD/Oil- or ND/CCl4-treated groups at 12 weeks, suggesting that ductular reaction is increased by WD/CCl4 treatment in accordance with histologic findings (Fig. 5A and C).

The number of Ki67 positive hepatocytes as assessed by IHC was increased by WD/Oil or WD/CCl4 at 12 and 24 weeks (Fig. 5B and D); these changes corresponded to a marked increase in MIC1-1C3 positive cells, consistent with expanded progenitors (Fig. S5).

These results suggest that continuous liver damage and compensatory proliferation, a critical process in hepatocarcinogenesis,27 were promoted by WD/CCl4.

SECTION

WD/CCl4 accelerates development of HCC

PARAGRAPH

No tumor development was observed in mice at 12 weeks.

However, at 24 weeks, 30%, 10%, and 100% of mice had tumors in the WD/Oil, ND/CCl4, and WD/CCl4 treated groups, respectively.

Tumor numbers were increased further, and maximal tumor size was larger in WD/CCl4 treated mice (Fig. 6A and B).

Histologically, some tumors were diagnosed as dysplastic nodules (Fig. 6C–F).

Notably, HCC developed in 10% and 30% of WD/Oil and WD/CCl4 treated mice, respectively, but not in ND/CCl4 treated mice, underscoring the pro-carcinogenic effect of the WD.

In the WD/CCl4 group, steatohepatitic HCC28 (Fig. 6G–J), and clear-cell HCC (lipid variant) (Fig. 6K–N) were observed.

SECTION

Global transcriptome dysregulation aligns between human NASH and mouse NASH models

PARAGRAPH

Our comparative transcriptomic analyses have revealed a close similarity between our murine model and human NAFLD by analyzing the functional pathways affected, in contrast to a previous report that only examined individual genes across several models, and which suggested a significant dissimilarity between the two species.29

Specifically, we compared dysregulated molecular pathways from KEGG and HALLMARK gene sets in two human NASH series to 16 previously published diet, chemical, and/or genetic NASH mouse models together with our mouse models (Fig. 7 and Table S2).9,20,21,30–39

The mouse models were ranked according to their transcriptomic similarity to human NASH vs. healthy liver by molecular pathway analysis from KEGG.

Upregulated pathways in both human and mouse NASH models included focal adhesion, ECM receptor interaction, chemokine signaling pathways, Toll-like receptor pathways, and epithelial mesenchymal transition.

Downregulated pathways were related to parenchymal functions including fatty acid metabolism, bile acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation.

Insulin signaling/insulin resistance-related gene sets and type II diabetes-related gene sets were induced over time, supporting the presence of dysregulated glucose metabolism in our model (Fig. S6).

In contrast, this aberration in diabetes-related insulin signaling was not observed in MCD diet-fed mice, consistent with the notion that the MCD model lacks insulin resistance a feature observed in human NASH.

Emerging candidate NASH therapeutic targets, FXR, Fgf15 (mouse ortholog of human FGF19), and bile acid pathways are generally suppressed in our model, suggesting that our model can be utilized to test therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways (Fig. S6).

An altered composition of infiltrating immune cell subsets has been linked to experimental NASH pathogenesis.40

Consistent with this previous report, there was a marked increase in CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ positive cells in the livers of WD/CCl4 treated mice compared to controls as characterized by immunostaining and semi-quantitative assessment (Fig. 8 and Table S3).

Moreover, gene sets associated with CD4-positive T helper cells, especially Th17 cells, were suppressed compared to other subsets in our model (Fig. S7).

Confirmation of the presence of ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes was determined by the lack of CK8/18 cytoplasmic staining in hepatocytes with foamy cytoplasm (Fig. 8).

Further confirmatory staining with CK18 alone showed similar results (data not shown).

The lack of CK18 staining is indicative of ballooning when compared to neighboring hepatocytes with retained or positive cytoplasmic immunoreactivity.

Overall, our transcriptomic analysis indicated that dysregulated molecular pathways in our NASH model induced by WD plus CCl4 were similar to those of human NASH.

Of note, WD and CCl4 treatment for 12 weeks showed a higher similarity to human NASH vs. healthy liver than 24 weeks based on KEGG pathway analysis.

This is in agreement with the transcriptomic features of the tumors from mice treated with WD and CCl4, which are similar to human HCC molecular subclasses23 (Table S4).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this study, we report a simple murine NASH model by using WD and CCl4 that develops histological features of NASH with rapid progression of extensive fibrosis and HCC, and closely replicates the transcriptomic hallmarks of human NASH.

These features make the model unusually attractive as a platform for testing therapeutic agents for the disease.

In particular, severe steatohepatitis and stage 3 bridging fibrosis developed in mice as early as 12 weeks after the start of treatment.

Some of the mice treated with WD and CCl4 further progressed to stage 4 cirrhosis and HCC development at 24 weeks.

These histological phenotypes recapitulate the natural progression of human patients with NASH, albeit in a more telescoped time frame.

PARAGRAPH

Another key feature of our NASH model is the activation of HSCs.

HSCs are a major source of activated myofibroblasts, and their activation is well known to drive fibrosis in chronic liver disease including NASH.24,41,42

WD and CCl4 treatment induced proliferation and activation of HSCs earlier than WD treatment alone, suggesting that activation of HSCs was responsible for the rapid progression of fibrosis in our NASH model.

Furthermore, ductular reaction was upregulated in mice treated with WD and CCl4 for 12 weeks.

As expansion of HPCs and the extent of ductular reaction is correlated with fibrosis stage in patients with NASH,43 these results also support the similarity of our NASH model to the clinical setting of human patients.

PARAGRAPH

Western style diets containing high-fat, high-fructose (or sucrose), and high-cholesterol have been widely used to establish mouse NASH models because such dietary features have been associated with NASH development in humans, and can induce not only steatohepatitis, but also obesity and insulin resistance in mice.6,8,9,44,45

However, the major disadvantage of WD-based NASH models is that they do not fully progress to severe steatohepatitis and advanced fibrosis even after long-term feeding.6,8

Such murine models are not ideal for drug testing because diet feeding and drug treatment are lengthy and costly.

PARAGRAPH

CCl4 has been traditionally used for decades to induce liver injury and fibrosis in mice.10

In this study, we used CCl4 as a “fibrosis accelerator” because fibrosis appears from zone 3, around the central vein, with chronic CCl4 treatment.

In adult patients with NASH, it has been known that steatosis and fibrosis are observed in zone 3 at first.46

In addition, CCl4 treatment induces ballooning degeneration in mice,47 which is a typical hallmark of NASH.

Thus, CCl4 and WD could show synergistic effects to worsen pathophysiology of NASH.

As expected, CCl4 exacerbated hepatocyte ballooning, inflammation, fibrosis stage, HSC activation, DR, hepatocyte proliferation, and tumor development induced by WD.

The histological components of our NASH model induced by WD and CCl4 (steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning) were similar to those of human patients.

Of note, while the dietary cholesterol of this component is relatively high compared to other rodent models, cholesterol absorption in mice is much less efficient than in humans,48,49 and the hepatic levels of cholesterol following 1.2% dietary cholesterol approximate those of human NASH.50–52

PARAGRAPH

Besides liver histology, transcriptomic analysis also supports the similarity of our NASH model to human patients.

KEGG transcriptomic analysis indicates that our WD and CCl4 models are more similar to human NASH (vs. healthy liver) than 18 other previously published murine NASH models induced by diet, chemical toxins and genetic modifications (Fig. 7), whereas other models (e.g., MCD plus high-fat diet) resemble advanced human NASH, when classical features of the disease are lost as the liver becomes cirrhotic.

Upregulated molecular pathways in both human and our mouse NASH model included focal adhesion, ECM receptor interaction, chemokine signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor pathway, epithelial mesenchymal transition.

Downregulated pathways were related to parenchymal functions including fatty acid metabolism, bile acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation.

These transcriptomic changes have been implicated in the progression of NASH with advanced fibrosis.20

Of note, WD and CCl4 treatment for 12 weeks showed a higher similarity to human NASH than WD and CCl4 treatment for 24 weeks in KEGG pathway analysis (Fig. 7), suggesting that our model at 12 weeks replicates NASH with fibrosis, while the features progressed to NASH with cirrhosis and HCC at 24 weeks.

The similarity was further supported by the presence of inflammatory cell infiltrates at the same time point (Fig. 8 and Table S3), a feature also associated with NASH.40

PARAGRAPH

There are also limitations in our NASH model induced by WD and CCl4.

First, animals are only maximally insulin resistant when WD is administered, typical of patients with NAFLD,3 whereas insulin resistance in the WD plus CCl4 mice was at an intermediate level between WD alone and CCl4 alone.

The attenuated insulin resistance in the WD and CCl4 mice may result from the blunted weight gain when CCl4 was added to the WD.

However, only a subpopulation of NAFLD progresses to advanced fibrosis and HCC.

Thus, it is still unclear whether obesity and insulin resistance are essential to drive steatohepatitis, advanced fibrosis, and HCC occurrence.

Interestingly, obesity is not an independent risk factor of rapid fibrosis progression.1

Next, in HALLMARK transcriptomic analysis, the cholesterol homeostasis pathway was significantly downregulated, but was upregulated in human NASH, which likely reflects the fact that the ‘western diet’ used in our studies contains 1.25% of cholesterol, which as noted above, is necessary to lead to hepatic cholesterol levels that approximate those of human NASH as rodents do not absorb cholesterol well.

These transcriptomic changes are also observed in other NASH models induced by high-cholesterol containing WD.53

PARAGRAPH

In summary, by using WD and CCl4, we have generated a murine NASH model that develops key histological and transcriptomic features of human NASH within 12 weeks, and with consistent development of HCC by 24 weeks.

This could be a useful experimental tool for drug testing and to elucidate the pathophysiology of NASH.
