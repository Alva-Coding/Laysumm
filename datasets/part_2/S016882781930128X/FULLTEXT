TITLE

Cross-genotype AR3-specific neutralizing antibodies confer long-term protection in injecting drug users after HCV clearance

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the major global public health problems, with 71 million chronically infected people worldwide, which results in 350,000 to 500,000 liver-related deaths per year.1

Current direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment is very effective in clearing infection.2

However, despite high DAA efficacy, treatment alone is unlikely to eliminate HCV by the year 2030 as envisioned by the World Health Organization (WHO),1 since treated individuals may become reinfected if exposure continues.

Moreover, worldwide, most of the HCV-infected individuals are unaware of their HCV status because of the prolonged asymptomatic nature of HCV infection and limited access to diagnostic tests.3

In addition, as a result of the high cost of treatment, a large proportion of the HCV-infected individuals are left untreated.3

Therefore, for the global elimination of HCV, a preventive vaccine is urgently needed.

PARAGRAPH

Development of a protective vaccine against HCV seems feasible, since spontaneous clearance of the virus without antiviral therapy occurs in 25 to 40% of individuals after primary infection4 and in 30 to 60% of those who are reinfected following clearance of a primary infection.5

While clearance of HCV infection has been associated with strong and broad T cell responses,6,7 little is known about the role of antibodies in spontaneous clearance of HCV infection and protection upon re-exposure.

PARAGRAPH

HCV clearance has been associated with a neutralizing antibody response against HCV E1E2 glycoproteins during the early phase of infection.8,9

In addition, a number of broadly neutralizing antibodies have been isolated from B cells of chronically infected individuals.

In general, they target 1 of 3 epitopes which are located in or around the CD81 binding site: epitope I (amino acids 412–423), epitope II (amino acids 434–446) and domain B (amino acids 523–535).10–12

Interestingly, broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting epitope I or epitope II (AP33, HC84.26) protected humanized mice against HCV genotype 1b infection.13,14

It has also been shown that AR3A and AR3B antibodies targeting both epitope II and domain B, jointly referred to as antigenic region 3 (AR3), protected mice against HCV infection from isolate H77 (genotype 1a) and isolate J6 (genotype 2a) in combination with AR4A, an antibody recognizing antigenic region 4 (AR4).15–17

However, whether such broadly neutralizing antibodies contribute to spontaneous clearance and long-term immune protection in humans with ongoing exposure remains unanswered.

PARAGRAPH

The Amsterdam Cohort Study (ACS) among drug users (DU), is a prospective cohort study investigating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HCV infections, in which serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and socio-demographic and risk behavioural data are collected regularly.18

The ACS-DU cohort started in 1985 and came to an end in 2016, making it a unique cohort with one of the longest follow-up periods recorded in DUs globally.19

Importantly, all ACS participants who are injecting drug users (IDU) are, most likely, frequently (re-)exposed to HCV, since 65% reported at least weekly injecting drug use at enrolment in the cohort, with a baseline HCV antibody prevalence of 82% and an incidence of up to 28 primary infections per 100 person-years among IDU.20

Such a well-characterized cohort of highly exposed individuals with a long follow-up presents a unique opportunity to study the role of broadly neutralizing antibodies in the spontaneous clearance of HCV infection and protection upon re-exposure.

PARAGRAPH

Herein, we studied the frequency, cross-reactivity and epitopes of HCV E1E2 specific antibodies produced by memory B cells from ACS participants.

We found that the frequency of HCV specific cross-genotype antibodies, targeting mainly AR3 and AR4, was associated with spontaneous clearance of ≥1 HCV infection(s) and absence of HCV RNA at the end of the study period.

Material and methods

SECTION

Participants

PARAGRAPH

Individuals were selected from the ACS-IDU.

After giving written informed consent, ACS participants visited the Amsterdam Health Service every 4 to 6 months, where blood was drawn for laboratory testing, PBMCs were stored and participants completed a standardized questionnaire on risk behaviour.18

Our study relies in part on self-reports, which have been shown to be a valid method for measuring behavioural variables in our cohort, where social desirability does not play an important role.21

PARAGRAPH

For the study presented here, out of 106 individuals with an acute or recent HCV infection we selected those with at least 5 years of follow-up after primary infection, with available PBMCs.

Acute primary infection was defined by seroconversion for HCV antibodies (AxSym HCV version 3.0; Abbott) during follow-up.22

Recent infection was assumed when at cohort entry HCV antibodies were already present in individuals who had started injecting drugs less than 2 years before.

We excluded individuals who were HIV-seropositive or positive for HBV surface antigen (AxSym HBsAg, Abbott) at the time of HCV infection.

PARAGRAPH

For seroconverters, the date of the infection was estimated by calculating the midpoint between the last HCV seronegative visit and the first HCV seropositive visit.

The date of infection for the recent infections was estimated as the midpoint between the start of injecting drugs and cohort entry.22

PARAGRAPH

HCV viremia was determined for these individuals at yearly intervals using a transcription-mediated amplification assay with a detection limit of 5 IU/ml (Versant; Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics).

If HCV RNA was detected, genotyping was performed by sequencing the NS5B region.23

Clearance was defined as being HCV RNA negative at 2 subsequent time points.

After clearance, in some individuals, reinfection was documented, as evidenced by at least 1 HCV RNA positive time point during follow-up following clearance of an earlier infection.

Chronic infection was defined as continuous viremia for at least 2 years after the estimated date of (re)infection.

This study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the AMC and informed consent was obtained from all participants.

HCV genotype, HBV status and HIV status are summarized in Table S1.

SECTION

B cell isolation and cultures

PARAGRAPH

Frozen PBMCs were obtained and CD27+IgG+B cells were immortalized as described previously.24

In brief, B cells were isolated and, after stimulation, the cells were transduced with a retroviral vector containing the transgenes BCL6, BCL-xL and green fluorescent protein as marker gene.

Transduced B cells were maintained in culture with gamma-irradiated CD40 Ligand expressing L-cells and recombinant mouse interleukin-21.

The transduced B cells secrete immunoglobulins (antibodies) into the culture supernatant.

SECTION

Multiplex flow cytometry assay

PARAGRAPH

To determine the breadth of the antibodies, we performed a multiplex flow cytometry assay as described previously.25

In brief, antibodies present in B cell supernatants were incubated with a mix of fluorescently barcoded 293 T/17 cells (ATCC) transfected with full-length E1E2 derived from 6 HCV genotypes (Supplementary material and methods).

After addition of the secondary polyclonal goat anti-human IgG-PE antibody (Southern Biotech), the fluorescence was measured using a FACSCantoTM II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).

To determine E1E2 antibody binding, the value obtained for binding to E1E2 transfected cells was subtracted from the value obtained for binding to non-transfected cells and normalized by using the average of the 7 negative antibody controls.

The cut-off value for binding was based on values of 882 B cell supernatants from 3 HCV uninfected individuals (Fig. S1, Supplementary material and methods).

SECTION

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

PARAGRAPH

To determine the binding characteristics of the antibodies, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed as described previously.26

In brief, plates were coated either with the HIS-tagged E2 ectodomain (Supplementary material and methods) or with Galanthus nivalis lectin on which E1E2 protein containing 293 T/17 cell lysate was captured.

Then, antibodies present in B cell supernatant were added and binding was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-human IgG (Jackson).

Optical density (OD) at 450 nm was measured with an EnVision Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer).

SECTION

HCV pseudoparticle neutralization

PARAGRAPH

The neutralizing activity of antibodies was determined using the HCV pseudoparticle (HCVpp) system based on luciferase reporter gene activity (Supplementary material and methods).

SECTION

HCV cell culture neutralization

PARAGRAPH

Neutralization activity of antibodies was determined using the HCV cell culture (HCVcc) system as described previously.27,28

The detailed procedure is described in the supplementary material and methods.

SECTION

Antibody sequencing

PARAGRAPH

The variable regions of the antibody heavy and light chain from the cross-genotype B cells were sequenced as described previously.29

In brief, total RNA was isolated from B cells and after generation of cDNA, the cDNA from the heavy and light chain were specifically amplified by PCR.

Finally, the sequences were obtained by Sanger sequencing using BDT reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and were submitted to the IMGT/V-QUEST database to assess V(D)J usage and somatic hypermutation status.30

SECTION

Data analysis

PARAGRAPH

Data were analysed using Prism software (GraphPad).

Statistical comparison between categories was performed using a 1-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, as we hypothesized that cross-genotype antibodies were more frequently present in individuals who spontaneously cleared infection(s) (software package SPSS, v. 19.09, IBM).

Flow cytometry data were analysed using FlowJo software (FlowJo).

Results

SECTION

Characteristics of the study population

PARAGRAPH

Thirteen cohort participants with acute or recent HCV infection met the inclusion criteria for this study.

The median age of the selected individuals was 29 years (interquartile range [IQR] 23–33) at the time of HCV infection (Table 1).

The median follow-up time of these individuals after primary HCV infection was 17.5 years (IQR 11.7–18.9).

The individuals were classified into 2 groups based on the outcome of HCV infection: (i) individuals who became chronically infected (CHRs; n = 5) either after primary infection (CHR1-3), or after HCV reinfection (CHR 4–5); (ii) individuals who cleared ≥1 HCV infections and were HCV RNA negative at the end of follow-up (CL1-8).

All individuals who cleared the infection were presumably re-exposed to HCV as they continued injecting drugs for a median of 5.9 years after primary infection during a time period (1986–1994) of extremely high HCV incidence (10–28 per 100 person-years) in this cohort.20

Frequent re-exposure was also evidenced by the occurrence of ≥1 reinfections, which were documented in 8 of 13 individuals.

Characteristics of all 13 individuals are summarized in Table 1.

SECTION

High frequencies of cross-genotype antibodies in CLs

PARAGRAPH

From each participant, 7 to 15 million PBMCs were available that had been collected 0.75 year (IQR 0.54–1.12) after HCV infection (Table 1).

From these PBMCs, CD27+IgG+B cells were purified and subsequently immortalized.24

A total of 10,290 cells per individual were cultured as mini-cultures at a density of 35 cells per well.

Antibodies secreted in the B cell supernatant were analysed for binding to 293 T cells transfected with full-length E1E2 from HCV genotypes 1a, 2b, 3a, 4, 5 and 6, using the multiplexed flow cytometry assay as described before.25

PARAGRAPH

At a density of 35 cells per well, the percentage of positive wells was below or equal to 37%.

We, therefore, assumed based on the Poisson’s distribution, that only 1 out of the 35 cells produced E1E2 specific antibodies.

The median frequency of E1E2 specific antibodies in the B cell repertoire was 14.6 antibodies per 10,000 CD27+IgG+B cells for CHRs (IQR 3.9–18.5) and 16.5 antibodies per 10,000 CD27+IgG+B cells for CLs (IQR 3.6–77) (Fig. 1A).

Although the frequencies did not differ between the groups, the antibodies from CHRs were mainly genotype-specific and directed against the genotype of the ongoing infection.

This confirmed findings by Tarr et al., who described the relationship between serum antibody reactivity and genotype of infection.31

Antibodies from CLs showed a much broader reactivity than CHR derived antibodies.

The absolute number of antibodies recognizing at least 3 or more genotypes was significantly higher in CLs than CHRs (CLs: 13 (IQR 2.2–53.0) vs. CHRs: 0 (IQR 0–1.9), p = 0.03, Fig. 1B and Fig. S2).

Three out of 8 CLs had antibodies that recognized all 6 HCV genotypes with a median frequency of 3.9 per 10,000 CD27+IgG+B cells (IQR 3.4–14.6).

Such broadly reactive antibodies were not detected in CHRs.

SECTION

Cross-genotype antibodies from CLs predominantly target AR3

PARAGRAPH

To further characterize cross-genotype antibodies from CLs, we selected 113 B cell cultures from CL1, CL2, CL3, and CL7, who had the highest frequency of cross-genotype antibodies (Fig. S3).

To determine the epitopes targeted by these antibodies, we tested the antibodies secreted in the B cell supernatant by ELISA for binding to E2 alanine mutants in the 4 epitopes known to be recognized by broadly neutralizing HCV antibodies.

Twelve alanine mutants were generated with mutations in epitope I (L413, G418 and W420), in AR3/epitope II (L441, F442 and Y443), in AR3/domain B (W529, G530 and D535) and in AR4 (R657, L692 and D698).16,32,33

Epitope specificity was determined by measuring the reduction in antibody binding to ≥1 alanine mutants from the panel.

An epitope was considered to be specifically recognized if an alanine mutation in that epitope resulted in more than a 50% reduction of antibody binding compared to binding to wild-type E2.

PARAGRAPH

In all 4 participants, the majority of the cross-genotype antibodies (82/113, 73%) were specific for AR3 (Fig. 2A) as binding to the AR3-specific mutants (F442A, G530A and D535A) was reduced by more than 50% (Fig. 2B).

Interestingly, binding of a subset of AR3-specific antibodies was not strongly affected by the alanine mutation in residue 441, which is in contrast to recent data from Gopal et al. who showed that this L441A mutation affected all AR3 antibodies.33

Furthermore, we observed that 3 antibodies (C03, E17 and M11) found in participant CL2 were specific for an epitope shared by epitope I and AR3, as was evident by the loss of binding to the mutant W420A.

This finding was confirmed at the monoclonal B cell level (Fig. S4).

PARAGRAPH

Besides antibodies specific to AR3, we observed that cross-reactive antibodies targeting AR4 were present in 3 CLs, as indicated by the decreased binding to the mutants R657A, L692A and D698A.

Interestingly, these AR4-specific antibodies showed no or low binding to the soluble E2 ectodomain (Fig. S5).

Finally, we did not find antibodies that recognized only epitope I or epitope II in any of the CLs.

SECTION

Monoclonal cross-genotype antibodies from CLs are broadly neutralizing

PARAGRAPH

Thus far, antibody characteristics were determined using supernatants of B cells cultured at a density of 35 cells per well and therefore the supernatants of those cultures could contain 34 irrelevant antibodies.

Therefore, we analysed antibodies at the monoclonal B cell level to study the neutralizing potency of the antibodies in more detail.

Focusing on cross-genotype antibodies against AR3 and AR4, 13 mini-cultures with different alanine mutant patterns were selected, of which B cell clones were generated by single cell sorting (Supplementary material and methods).

Immunoglobulin genes of AR3 and AR4 binding B cell clones were sequenced and 10 unique antibody sequences were identified (Fig. 3A).

In addition, 2 additional monoclonal antibodies (AT1706 and AT1618) were isolated, from participant CL7 who had the highest frequency of cross-genotype antibodies when screening directly 5,000 CD27+IgG+single cell cultures for HCVpp neutralization activity.

All 12 antibodies were of the IgG1 isotype.

In addition, the majority of AR3-specific antibodies (AT antibodies 1637-1640,1642,1643,1645) used a VH gene of the VH1.69 family.

These results are in line with our findings and those of others.15,26,34

PARAGRAPH

Next, we confirmed the cross-reactivity of the monoclonal antibodies by ELISA, using the panel of 8 E1E2 sequences from genotypes 1 to 6 (Fig. 3B).

As expected from the mini-culture data, AT1644 and AT1645 were specific for sequences from only 3 different HCV genotypes, whereas all other antibodies bound to E1E2 from genotypes 1 to 6.

PARAGRAPH

The neutralization capacity of the antibodies was tested using the HCVpp system expressing E1E2 from genotypes 1a, 1b, 3a and 4d.

These HCVpp were all relatively sensitive to neutralization by AR3B and AR4A (Fig. 4A).

Except for AT1644, which did not neutralize, all monoclonal antibodies neutralized  ≥ 1 HCVpp with 10 antibodies showing broad cross-neutralization (Fig. 4B).

All AR3-specific antibodies (AT antibodies 1637-1640,1642, 1643,1645 and 1706 – Fig. S6) neutralized HCVpp with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) range from 0.088 to 1.41 µg/ml (Fig. 4B), while the AR4-specific antibodies (AT1644, AT1646, AT1647 and AT1618 – Fig. S6) had IC50 values above 0.1 µg/ml (Fig. 4B).

PARAGRAPH

The neutralization capacity of the antibodies was further tested using a panel of 4 HCVpp which have been shown to be resistant to antibody-mediated neutralization (Fig. 4C).35

Eight out of 12 antibodies (AT antibodies 1637–1640,1642, 1643,1618 and 1706) neutralized ≥1 resistant HCVpp with an IC50 range of 0.39 to 18.2 µg/ml (Fig. 4D).

Of these antibodies, AT1640 and AT1618 neutralized all 8 HCV isolates (Fig. 4B and Fig. 4D).

Importantly, by examining the combined neutralization profiles of the antibodies per participant, antibodies from 3 of the 4 individuals tested (CL1, CL2 and CL7) covered all tested HCVpp.

PARAGRAPH

To confirm the neutralization capacity of the antibodies, AT antibodies were tested at 20 µg/ml for neutralization of HCVcc (isolate H77).

Apart from AT1645, all AR3-specific antibodies (AT antibodies 1638-1640, 1643 and 1706) neutralized infection by more than 50% (Fig. 5A).

In addition to AR3 specific antibodies, neutralization activity above 50% was observed for the AR4-specific antibody AT1618.

These findings were consistent with the data obtained using HCVpp.

PARAGRAPH

Since AT1618 targets AR4, and we showed that it is able to neutralize all HCVpp from our panel, including the resistant ones, we wanted to confirm its breadth in the HCVcc system using the JFH1 prototype (genotype 2) and ED43 HCV chimera (genotype 4a).

We found that AT1618 neutralized both viruses with IC50 values of 0.27 µg/ml and 0.080 µg/ml, respectively (Fig. 5B and 5C).

PARAGRAPH

As the expression of HCV entry factors most probably differs between Huh-7 cells and primary human hepatocytes, we repeated HCVpp neutralization experiments using primary hepatocytes.

At least 1 antibody from each individual was selected for this experiment (AT1638, 1637, 1642, 1706 and 1618).

As shown in Fig. 6A, at a concentration of 0.5 µg/ml, all antibodies neutralized genotype 1a H77 HCVpp infection by more than 50% using primary hepatocytes.

Moreover, AT1638, 1637 and 1642 also reduced the infection of AMS 3a.26 HCVpp by more than 50% (Fig. 6B).

However, AT1706 and AT1618 reduced infection of AMS 3a.26 HCVpp by 25% to 50%.

This reduction was consistent with data from the neutralization experiments using Huh-7 cells, where the IC50 values for AMS3a.26 HCVpp were >1.36 and 1.64 µg/ml, respectively (Fig. 4B).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

For the design of a protective HCV vaccine, a detailed understanding of the mechanism by which HCV infection is spontaneously cleared, is crucial.

A strong and broad T cell response has been associated with clearance of HCV (re)infection.6,7

However, the role of B cells producing HCV neutralizing antibody is largely undefined.

Here, we studied the B cell repertoire against HCV E1E2 in a cohort of persistent IDU following clearance of primary HCV infection.

We compared the breadth of the antibodies against E1E2 early after infection between individuals who were HCV RNA negative at the end of study follow-up (CLs) and individuals who ultimately became chronically infected (CHRs).

Our main finding is that the frequency of B cells producing cross-genotype antibodies was significantly higher in CLs compared to CHRs.

Moreover, in a subset of 4 CLs who we studied in more detail, we found that these cross-genotype antibodies mainly recognized AR3 and showed broad neutralizing activity.

In addition, in 3 of these 4 CLs, we also identified cross-genotype antibodies targeting AR4.

PARAGRAPH

The role of cross-neutralizing antibodies in protection against HCV infection in real-life settings has rarely been studied.

Pestka et al. were the first to demonstrate that polyclonal serum neutralizing antibody responses were associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV infection.8

Recently it was shown that cross-neutralization of a genotype 1 HCVpp panel by serum from individuals infected with genotype 1 and non-1 viruses, was associated with HCV clearance.9

From 2 of these individuals, broadly neutralizing antibodies were isolated.34

In the study presented here, a high frequency of B cells producing cross-genotype antibodies early after infection was associated with clearance of HCV infection.

Moreover, in 4 of these individuals with such strong cross-genotype B cell response, we isolated broadly neutralizing antibodies.

It is tempting to hypothesize that these B cells expressing broadly neutralizing antibodies were induced during infection and contributed to viral clearance.

PARAGRAPH

It is important to note, however, that we do find variation in both breadth and frequency in the antibody responses between CL individuals.

Participant CL5 for example presented only with genotype-specific antibodies, which could be due to the time point of PBMC selection or indicate that other components of the immune system such as T cells may have played a role in viral clearance.

In addition to differences in breadth, we observed a relatively large difference in the frequency of E1E2 specific antibodies (IQR: 3.6–77 antibodies per 10,000 antibodies).

This could be a consequence of the time point of PBMC selection, natural inter-donor variation or technical issues.

PARAGRAPH

The longitudinal design of our study enabled the selection of a subgroup of cohort participants (CLs) who never became chronically infected, despite presumably frequent re-exposure, since they continued injecting drugs during a long period in which incidence of infection was very high in IDU.20

Indeed, reinfections were documented after the time point of PBMC collection in 3 of these CLs, even though HCV RNA testing, with a median of 11 HCV RNA tests per case,22 was not performed regularly enough to diagnose all reinfections.36

Despite this assumed frequent re-exposure, CLs were HCV RNA negative at the end of a median follow-up of 17.7 years and developed memory B cells expressing broadly neutralizing antibodies.

This finding is consistent with previous reports that described memory B cells expressing broadly neutralizing antibodies, which were taken from IDUs who did not become chronically infected for more than 5 years following the clearance of primary infection.26,34

Importantly, we also showed that such B cell responses can be long-lasting, since memory B cells expressing broadly neutralizing antibodies were circulating 25 years after clearance of the primary infection.26

In this study, we confirm the longevity of memory AR3-specific B cells as these B cells were still circulating 5.2 years after clearance of the primary infection in the CL3 participant (Fig. S7).

Taken together, this suggests that broadly neutralizing antibodies induced during primary infection also contribute to the prevention of the subsequent chronic infections.

However, such broadly neutralizing antibodies may not always provide sterilizing immunity, as indicated by the reinfections we observed in CLs.

PARAGRAPH

The majority of antibodies with cross-reactivity against at least 3 genotypes recognized AR3.

From the 4 CLs with the largest number of HCV specific B cell cultures, we isolated 8 AR3-specific monoclonal antibodies and confirmed their broadly neutralizing properties.

This finding is consistent with other studies where AR3-specific antibodies have been isolated from individuals who cleared all infections.26,34

The dominance of AR3-specific antibodies in the B cell repertoire from CLs suggests that these antibodies play an important role in protection against HCV infection.

PARAGRAPH

Besides AR3-specific antibodies, we also detected cross-genotype antibodies targeting AR4.

Little is known about AR4, since the focus has mainly been on the antibody AR4A.16

While it has been suggested that AR4-specific antibodies are rare, we observed that 27 out of 113 (24%) cross-genotype antibodies targeted AR4, and that these antibodies were present in 3 of the 4 CLs.

Although less abundant than AR3 antibodies, this suggests that AR4 targeting antibodies may be present in most individuals who develop cross-reactive antibodies.

However, in contrast to the broad neutralization of AR4A, only 1 out of the 4 broadly reactive monoclonal AR4-specific antibodies, isolated by us, showed broadly neutralizing capacity (AT1618).

Consistent with previous observations for AR4A,16 we found that AR4-specific antibodies did not bind to the soluble E2 ectodomain, suggesting that AR4-specific antibodies only bind to the E1E2 complex or, alternatively, that a different conformation of soluble E2 precludes the binding of AR4A-like antibodies.

PARAGRAPH

Several studies have shown that AR3- and AR4-specific antibodies act synergistically16,37 and importantly, antibodies targeting AR3 (AR3A, AR3B) protected mice against HCV infection in combination with antibody AR4A.17

Thus, our observation that 3 out of 4 CL individuals developed both AR3- and AR4-specific antibodies is interesting, since it may suggest a similarly combined neutralizing role of AR3 and AR4 specific antibodies in the clearance of HCV.

If this is confirmed in future studies, a vaccine should induce antibodies against these 2 antigenic regions.

PARAGRAPH

Although we did not detect antibodies recognizing all genotypes in CHRs, others did isolate broadly reactive antibodies targeting AR3 from chronically infected individuals.15,38

However, these antibodies were only found relatively late after infection.

Here, we found that CLs had already developed B cells expressing cross-reactive antibodies within 1 year of acquiring HCV, while the CHRs at the same time point had mainly developed genotype-specific antibodies.

This is in line with Osburn et al. who showed that the development of cross-reactive antibodies is delayed in chronically infected individuals.9

Interestingly, 1 CHR (CHR2) had 4 cross-reactive antibodies which were specific for only 2 to 4 genotypes (Fig. 1B).

We found that those cross-reactive antibodies targeted AR3 (Fig. S8).

Taken together, this suggests that in chronically infected individuals, AR3-specific antibody responses may be too weak and/or may develop too late to prevent chronic infection.

If confirmed, this means that a strong and broadly neutralizing antibody response should be established very early after infection in order to confer protection.

PARAGRAPH

For the early development of cross-reactive antibodies, the host genetics may also be crucial; it was shown that the early appearance of cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies was associated with 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms located upstream of the HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA2 genes.9

PARAGRAPH

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study comparing B cell repertoires against HCV E1E2 in individuals who spontaneously cleared ≥1 infection(s), with those in individuals who ultimately developed a chronic infection.

Our data suggest that an early and strong B cell response, inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies against AR3 and AR4, is important for viral clearance and prevention of subsequent chronic infections upon re-exposure.

These observations permit cautious optimism that development of an effective preventive vaccine is feasible.
