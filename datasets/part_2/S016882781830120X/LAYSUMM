TITLE

Recipient characteristics and morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation

PARAGRAPH

Over the last decade, liver transplantation of sicker, older patient with multiple co-morbidities has increased.

In this study, we show that a set of recipient factors (recipient age >60 years, ventilator status, diabetes, hemodialysis and creatinine >1.5 mg/dl) can help identify patients that may not do well after transplant.

Transplanting sicker organs in patients with certain combinations of these characteristics leads to lower survival.
