TITLE

Crosstalk between adipose tissue insulin resistance and liver macrophages in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

The recent epidemic of chronic liver disease is related to the burden of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), paralleling the worldwide increase of obesity.1

NAFLD is a complex condition related to metabolic derangements in insulin resistance (IR), but in a subset of patients the liver becomes the target of multiple hits leading to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the histological phenotype that may progressively lead to the development of liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and possibly hepatocellular carcinoma.1,2

Understanding the biological and environmental factors that drive the progression to NASH and beyond in some individuals is fundamental to the development of robust methods for diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy.2

PARAGRAPH

The prevailing notion of NASH pathogenesis is that a deranged metabolic milieu specifically interacts with local mediators of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, but the nature of these interactions has not been fully elucidated.3,4

It is generally believed that adipose tissue IR plays a pivotal role in the onset and progression of NAFLD.5,6

Briefly, weight gain leads to expansion of adipose tissue and recruitment of macrophages through the secretion of various chemo- and cytokines.7

Inflamed and dysfunctional adipose tissue actively releases free fatty acids (FFAs) into the bloodstream, promotes lipotoxicity in the liver, muscle and pancreas,3 and contributes to systemic inflammation.

In the normal liver, resident macrophages or Kupffer cells (KCs) play important regulatory roles through crosstalk with the different cell types and particularly with hepatocytes.8

The pro-inflammatory polarization of hepatic macrophages is considered a hallmark of progressive disease, in the livers of patients with NASH, and an attractive therapeutic target as recently reviewed.8

Hepatic lipid accumulation facilitates pro-inflammatory KC polarization, possibly as a consequence of FFA excess, or signals from surrounding steatotic hepatocytes, such as histidine-rich glycoprotein, extracellular vesicles or damage-associated molecular patterns.8

More recently, data derived from animal models and in vitro studies suggest that both pro-inflammatory KCs and recruited hepatic macrophages (Ly6Chi) contribute to decreased hepatic insulin sensitivity by inhibiting insulin signaling and activating hepatic glucose production.9

However, most data available have been derived from mouse models, which are not fully representative of human NASH, since they reflect certain aspects of the pathogenesis and rarely incorporate the full spectrum of etiology-specific mechanisms.8

PARAGRAPH

Soluble CD163 (sCD163) is the ecto-domain of the hemoglobin-haptoglobin scavenger receptor which is exclusively expressed on macrophages and monocytes.

It is shed to the circulation during macrophage activation by metalloprotease activity (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17)).10,11

CD163-positive macrophages are highly expressed in human adipose tissue from obese individuals, while sCD163 levels are associated with hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in patients with NAFLD12,13 and decrease after successful life-style intervention and bariatric surgery.14–16

PARAGRAPH

Against this background, we carried out this study to further elucidate the complex interplay between IR in target organs/tissues, macrophage activation and hepatic damage in a well-characterized cohort of non-diabetic patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD.

Material and methods

SECTION

Study participants

PARAGRAPH

The study was performed in 40 patients with NAFLD, selected from consecutive patients who had a liver biopsy for the evaluation of suspected NAFLD between June 2010 and June 2013 in the Liver Unit of the University of Torino, according to the absence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and morbid obesity (body mass index [BMI] >35); the absence of the 2 latter conditions in our patients unveils the independent contribution of NAFLD to metabolic and inflammatory alterations.

Other etiologies of liver disease, including viral, autoimmune, cholestatic, genetic, metabolic, alcoholic and drug-induced were excluded.

Past and current ethanol intake <20 g/day had been confirmed through direct questioning of patients and a close relative.

A complete medical history and physical examination was undertaken and anthropometric data collected at the time of liver biopsy.

BMI was calculated on the basis of weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters), waist circumference (to the nearest half-centimetre) was measured at the midpoint between the lower border of the rib cage and the iliac crest.

Central obesity was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria (>94 cm men, >80 cm women).

SECTION

Histological features

PARAGRAPH

All liver biopsies were centrally read at the University of Torino soon after the procedure had been performed.

Liver specimens were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, Masson’s trichrome, and special stains for iron and copper and examined by a local expert liver pathologist blinded to patient clinical information.

The average length of liver tissue was 25 mm (range 14–45 mm), with a minimum of 11 portal tracts.

Histological features of NAFLD, i.e. steatosis, inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, and fibrosis were assessed and scored as described by Kleiner et al.17 Diagnosis of NASH was established according to the joint presence of steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and lobular inflammation with or without fibrosis.

SECTION

Analytical determinations

PARAGRAPH

Serum samples for laboratory investigations were collected at the time of liver biopsy and stored at −80 °C.

Biochemical exams included the complete blood count, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, albumin, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl-transferase.

Serum glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method (Sentinel, Milan, Italy).

FFA concentrations were determined by enzymatic colorimetric assays (WAKO diagnostic, Richmond, VA).

Triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (Chol) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-Chol) levels were assessed by enzymatic colorimetric assays (Sentinel), the latter after precipitation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein.

LDLs were measured with a standardized homogeneous enzymatic colorimetric method in order to avoid the effects of triglycerides (Sentinel, Milan, Italy).

SECTION

Genotyping

PARAGRAPH

Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood using the EZ1 DNA Blood 350 µl kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Genotyping for PNPLA3 was performed with the TaqMan Single Nucleotide Polymorphism allelic discrimination assay (Applied Biosystems, CA).

SECTION

Study ethics

PARAGRAPH

The study, designed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, was approved by the ethics committee of the University Hospital “Città della Salute e della Scienza” of Torino.

All patients gave signed consent for collection of personal data in the database, use of blood samples and liver tissue for research and for participation in the tracer study.

SECTION

“In vivo” tracer protocol

PARAGRAPH

All tracer studies were performed within 1 month of liver biopsy, in the absence of significant weight loss (>5%) or medications for NASH.

In vivo hepatic (Hep)-IR and AT-IR were assessed by the stable isotope technique in the fasting state and during a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), after an overnight fast.

A primed-continuous infusion of 6,6-D2-glucose (bolus 22 µmol/kg, infusion rate 0.22 µmol/kg/min) and of U-D5-glycerol (bolus 1.5 μmol/kg, infusion rate 0.1 μmol/kg/min) was administered for 2 h in fasting conditions (equilibration period) to assess endogenous glucose production (EGP) and lipolysis through the rate of appearance (Ra) of Glycerol, as previously described.18

After reaching isotopic steady state for 6,6-D2-glucose and U-D5-glycerol (after 2 h infusion), the patients drank 75 g of glucose with 1.5 g of U-13C-glucose (double tracer-OGTT) while continuing stable isotope infusion at a constant rate.

Plasma samples were collected every 30 min for 3 h.

PARAGRAPH

Tracer enrichment of 6,6-D2-glucose and U-D5-glycerol was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system (5975; Agilent, Palo Alto, CA), using electron impact ionization and selectively ion monitoring, and integrating peaks of mass to charge ratios of 200, 201, 202, and 205 for glucose and 145, 148 for glycerol.

Tracer enrichments were calculated as tracer/trace ratios (TTR) from peak area-ratios (R) at each time point (t) corrected for baseline (bk, pre-infusion) as previously described;18,19 briefly:

PARAGRAPH

TTR6,6-D2-glucose (t) = R202/200 (t) − R202/200 (bk) − R202/200 (t) × (R201/200 (t) − R201/200 (bk))

PARAGRAPH

TTRU-D5-glycerol (t) = R148/145 (t) − R148/145 (bk)

PARAGRAPH

Glucose fluxes and glycerol Ra were calculated as infusion rate/TTR during fasting and using non-steady state mathematical models during the OGTT, as previously reported.18,19

Glucose clearance represents the amount of glucose taken up and metabolized by the muscle in the unit of time, which is a measure of insulin sensitivity in the muscle.

Because the insulin concentration is a strong inhibitory stimulus for lipolysis,20,21 adipose tissue IR can be calculated as FFA × fasting insulin (Adipo-IR) or as glycerol Ra × fasting insulin (Lipo-IR).

Specifically, Adipo-IR takes into consideration the FFAs that are released into the circulation (i.e. not re-esterified intracellularly after TG hydrolysis) while Lipo-IR is calculated using glycerol Ra as index lipolysis since it measures the complete hydrolysis of TG.

Insulin is also a strong inhibitory stimulus for endogenous glucose production20 thus hepatic-IR is calculated as EGP × fasting insulin.18,19

SECTION

Fat quantification in specific sites

PARAGRAPH

Liver fat was assessed by liver biopsy as percentage of steatosis in hepatocytes and by standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The MRI estimates of liver fat content highly correlated with hepatic fat at biopsy (r = 0.80, p <0.0001).

Since we do not have MRI estimates of inflammation and fibrosis, all analysis was carried out based on histological features to avoid a potential source of bias.

Visceral fat (VF) and subcutaneous fat (SCF) were measured by MRI with a specific volumetric reconstruction software in all individuals.5

SECTION

Circulating sCD163 measurement

PARAGRAPH

Plasma concentrations of sCD163 were determined in duplicate by an in-house sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a BEP-2000 ELISA-analyzer (Dade Behring), essentially as previously described.22

The sCD163 measurements were part of a combined biobank study investigating the association between sCD163 and liver morphology in patients with NAFLD.13

We previously established a reference range (0.69–3.86 mg/L) for sCD163 in a large cohort (n = 240) of healthy individuals using the same assay.23

SECTION

Hepatic expression of CD163

PARAGRAPH

A total of 20 liver biopsies were available for RNA extraction.

Biopsies had been collected in RNAlater (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) and stored at −80 °C until processing.

Total RNA extraction was performed using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA).

For each sample, 1 µg of total RNA was treated with deoxyribonuclease I (Invitrogen, CA) prior to reverse transcription, in turn performed with random primers and the SuperScript® II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, CA).

As housekeeping genes, succinate dehydrogenase subunit A (SDHA) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were used.

Primers for the target genes CD163 and ADAM-17 were derived from the literature.24

The control sample used as calibrator was a cDNA derived from an individual without features of NASH.

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using the SsoAdvanced™ Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) according to the instrument protocol: 98 °C for 30 s for polymerase activation, 95 °C for 15 s for cDNA denaturation followed by 39 cycles of 60 °C for 30 s for annealing and extension.

All samples and controls were analyzed in duplicate.

The relative expression of CD163 and ADAM-17 was calculated as 2−ΔCt and expressed as fold increase over the calibrator sample.

Negative controls (no template cDNA) were run in every experimental plate to exclude potential contamination.

Specificity of the amplified PCR products was determined by melting curve analysis.

Gene expression analysis was performed by CFX Manager™ Software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA).

SECTION

Cell culture

PARAGRAPH

Human CD14 monocyte-derived macrophages were matured in M-CSF (50 ng/ml) media supplemented with 10% AB serum for 7 days.

On day 7, cells were washed twice with serum free RPMI and replaced with RPMI containing 1% FBS and treated with either 500 μM or 750 μM palmitate (made fresh on the day) for 24 h. Supernatant was collected and centrifuged for 2,000 rpm for 5 min to remove cells or cell debris.

Supernatant was then assayed using a human CD163 ELISA (R&D systems Cat no: DC1630).

SECTION

Immunohistochemistry

PARAGRAPH

Immunohistochemical analyses were performed in all biopsies using a mouse monoclonal anti-human CD163 antibody (Cell Marque, Rocklin, CA, USA; MRQ-26).

Cell clustering in liver tissues was quantified as previously reported.13

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Data are reported as mean ± SD for continuous normally distributed variables, as median and interquartile range for continuous non-normally distributed variables and number and frequency (%) for categorical variables.

Comparison between more than 2 groups was performed with Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous not normally distributed variables and by ANOVA for continuous normally distributed variables.

Similarly, comparisons between 2 groups were performed by Mann-Whitney U test for not normally distributed variables and by t test for normally distributed variables.

For categorical data, the Fisher’s exact test or Chi-square test were used as appropriate.

Spearman or Pearson correlation were used as appropriate to evaluate the correlation between sCD163 levels with anthropometric, metabolic and histological features.

Multivariable regression analysis was performed to assess the association between sCD163 levels and glucose and lipid fluxes from tracer studies (rp).

Values of p <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

All calculations were performed with MedCalc Software bvba version 12 (Mariakerke, Belgium).

Results

SECTION

Characteristics of the study patients

PARAGRAPH

The anthropometric, biochemical, and histological characteristics of the study participants (n = 40) are reported in Table 1.

Overall, only one-third of patients (35%) were obese according to BMI, but central obesity was found in more than half (60%) and it was the most common feature of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), followed by hypertension (38%), low HDL-Chol (35%), hyperglycemia (23%) and hypertriglyceridemia (10%).

Nevertheless, only 32% of patients met the criteria for the diagnosis of MetS.

As per selection criteria, no patient had T2DM but 35% of them had a family history of T2DM and 48% had IR defined as homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-IR >2.7.

The PNPLA3 GG genotype was found in 22.5% of patients, but the clinical and histological features did not differ according to genetic variants (Table S1).

Among histological features, hepatic steatosis was mild (<33%) in 52% of the study participants, moderate (33–66%) in 25% and severe (≥66%) in 23%, respectively.

A diagnosis of NASH was made in 67% of cases according to the joint presence of steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning.

Less than half of the patients had no/negligible fibrosis, while moderate and severe fibrosis was evenly distributed in the remaining patients (Table 1).

SECTION

Metabolic variables and histological features of liver damage

PARAGRAPH

Table 2 summarizes the metabolic variables, including glucose and lipid fluxes from tracer studies, in all individuals according to the degree of fibrosis.

The plasma levels of glucose, triglycerides, total and HDL cholesterol were unchanged across the spectrum of liver damage, while insulin levels, FFA levels and HOMA-IR significantly increased in relation to the severity of fibrosis (Table 2).

Adipose tissue IR, calculated based on both FFA levels (Adipo-IR) and the rate of lipolysis (Lipo-IR), rose stepwise by fibrosis staging (Table 2 and Fig. 1A and B), confirming its putative role in liver damage as previously described.21,25

Adipose tissue IR (Adipo-IR and Lipo-IR) also showed a strong correlation with hepatic fat (Fig. 1C and D).

Notably, the correlation with steatosis was stronger for Lipo-IR, which considers body weight (since lipolysis is expressed as µmol/min normalized by body weight) (Table 2), suggesting that this correlation was not mediated by BMI.

In order to further explore the latter possibility, we confirmed the association of Lipo-IR and steatosis by linear regression in the subgroup of non-obese patients with NAFLD (n = 25), whereas no association was found between BMI and liver fat (p = 0.146).

Adipose tissue IR was correlated with SCF (Adipo-IR vs. SCF r = 0.48, p = 0.008 and Lipo-IR vs. SCF r = 0.43, p = 0.018), but not with VF (p = 0.22 and 0.23, respectively) assessed by MRI (Table S2); this finding was not unexpected since VF can at most account for ∼20% of the total pre-hepatic FFA load.5

Overall, these results suggest that increased lipolysis from the adipose tissue (mainly subcutaneous) is linked to both fibrosis and fat accumulation in the liver of patients with NAFLD, independently of BMI and T2DM.

Conversely, glucose fluxes from the liver (EGP) and into the muscle (Glucose clearance) were unrelated to the severity of hepatic fibrosis (Table 2).

Hepatic-IR (Hep-IR) paralleled the increasing degree of liver fat (Fig. 1E), but not the severity of fibrosis (Fig. 1F).

In individuals with NAFLD and a NAFLD activity score (NAS) ≥4, both Hep-IR and adipose tissue IR (Adipo-IR and Lipo-IR) were higher (Fig. S1A-C), mainly because of their strong relationship with liver fat.

When the glucose and lipid substrates/fluxes were sub-divided according to the presence or absence of NASH, we did not find a significant difference in all the parameters assessed (Table S3).

SECTION

Macrophage activation and fat depots

PARAGRAPH

Overall, sCD163 levels increased proportionally to BMI, waist circumference and hepatic fat (r = 0.40, p = 0.01; r = 0.38, p = 0.015 and r = 0.53, p = 0.006, respectively) (Fig. 2A-C).

However, BMI was not associated with sCD163 levels, while the relationship with steatosis stayed significant both at univariate and multivariate analysis (Table S4).

Accordingly, in the subgroup of non-obese NAFLD (n = 25), sCD163 levels strongly correlated with liver fat (p <0.0001) but not with BMI (p = 0.383), suggesting an independent role of steatosis and BMI in NAFLD.

Since CD163-positive macrophages are also highly expressed in human adipose tissue from obese individuals, we evaluated the relationship between sCD163 and different measures of adiposity, including VF and subcutaneous SCF fat depots by standard MRI.

However, we did not observe any correlation between sCD163 levels and either VF or SCF (r = 0.28, p = 0.12 and r = 0.19, p = 0.30, respectively).

After linear multivariate regression analysis, hepatic steatosis at biopsy was significantly associated with sCD163 levels, independently of BMI, WC, VF and SCF (Table S4).

PARAGRAPH

In order to further confirm that circulating sCD163 levels were predominantly related to macrophage activation in the liver, hepatic CD163 expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC CD163) and by qPCR (hCD163) in a subgroup of 20 individuals with NAFLD, where liver tissue had been collected and stored (clinical data summarized in Table S5).

In the liver, we observed significant IHC CD163 staining, predominantly in patients with inflammation and fibrosis (Fig. 3A), while hCD163 had a significant, direct correlation with the circulating levels of sCD163 (r = 0.58, p = 0.007) (Fig. 3B).

This result was strengthened by the association between hepatic expression of ADAM-17 (hADAM-17), a specific metalloprotease involved in the cleavage and shedding of CD163, with both hCD163 (r = 0.64, p = 0.003) and sCD163 (r = 0.47, p = 0.047) (Fig. 3C and D, respectively).

Although we cannot exclude the contribution of adipose tissue macrophages to circulating sCD163, taken together these results may suggest that in our patients with NAFLD, circulating sCD163 mainly represents hepatic macrophage activation.

SECTION

Macrophage activation and histological features of liver damage

PARAGRAPH

Among other histological features, serum levels of sCD163 increased according to fibrosis stage (ANOVA p <0.001) (Fig. 2D) and were able to distinguish moderate (F = 2) from severe fibrosis (F3/F4).

No association was observed between sCD163 levels and lobular inflammation or ballooning (p >0.1 for both), but in patients with a NAS score ≥4, sCD163 levels were 1.3-fold higher than in NAS <4 (2.18 ± 0.74 vs. 1.68 ± 0.88, p = 0.05), as a consequence of the strong relationship with liver fat.

Although there was a positive trend in the correlation between CD163 mRNA (hCD163) and the total CD163+ hepatic macrophage scored by IHC (IHC CD163), statistical significance was not reached, probably because of a lack of statistical power for categorical analysis (N = 20) (Fig. S3).

SECTION

Relationship between macrophage activation and insulin resistance at different sites

PARAGRAPH

Next, we sought to understand the relationship between macrophage activation and impaired insulin sensitivity in the target tissues (liver, adipose tissue and muscle).

Circulating sCD163 levels were not directly related to insulin levels (Table 3), but they were significantly higher in individuals with NAFLD and HOMA-IR ≥2.7 (2.23 ± 0.57 vs. 1.71 ± 0.97, p = 0.002) and in those with MetS (2.29 ± 0.69 vs. 1.8 ± 0.75, p = 0.024) compared to their counterparts.

Notably, the activation of macrophages, expressed by sCD163 levels, paralleled both the plasma FFA levels and the flux of glycerol, mainly representing lipolysis from adipose tissue (Table 3).

Regression analysis confirmed the significant association between sCD163 levels and FFA concentration (rp = 0.35, p = 0.026).

In keeping with this finding, sCD163 was significantly associated with adipose tissue IR (Adipo-IR: rp = 0.32, p = 0.042; Lipo-IR: rp = 0.39, p = 0.012).

Thus, resident macrophage activation may be triggered by the overflow of FFAs to the liver and may be one of the missing links between adipose tissue IR and liver fibrosis.

PARAGRAPH

On the contrary, sCD163 levels were not associated with alterations in glucose metabolism, both as muscle insulin sensitivity (expressed as glucose clearance) or with glucose production by the liver (EGP) (Table 3).

In our non-diabetic individuals with NAFLD, at multivariate regression analysis, the major determinant of hepatic-IR was fat infiltration at liver biopsy, supporting the concept that steatosis per se can alter the regulation of glucose production by the liver.

In keeping with the relationship between sCD163 and hepatic fat in NAFLD, hCD163 also significantly correlated with the degree of steatosis (r = 0.34, p = 0.048) (Fig. 3C).

However, again no correlation was found between hCD163 and EGP (r = −0.27, p = 0.269) or Hep-IR (r = 0.11, p = 0.650).

SECTION

Potential mechanisms for hepatic macrophage activation by adipose tissue insulin resistance: in vitro experiments

PARAGRAPH

As described earlier, sCD163 levels were associated with circulating FFAs, lipid flux and adipose tissue IR, suggesting that alterations in lipid metabolism per se, such as FFA overflow may favor macrophage activation in the liver.

To investigate this possibility, we treated human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) with palmitate and measured sCD163 levels in culture media.

As shown in Fig. 4, exposure of hMDMs to palmitate increases sCD163 secretion, which is consistent with data in our study participants.

In fact, palmitic acid levels were significantly higher in patients with NAFLD and severe fibrosis compared to those with absent/mild fibrosis (184 µmol ± 57 vs. 121 µmol ± 42, p <0.001) and they were directly related to both sCD163 concentration and hepatic fat (r = 0.30, p = 0.05; r = 0.38, p = 0.017, Fig. S2A and B, respectively).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The present study indicates that macrophage activation in the liver of patients with NAFLD, possibly in addition to macrophage activation in the adipose tissue, stems from impaired lipid metabolism in the setting of IR.

While the role of adipose tissue inflammation in the onset of IR is not under discussion, it is likely that the overflow of FFAs to the liver is one of the main metabolic sources of activation of resident hepatic macrophages in patients with NAFLD and may be one of the mechanisms linking adipose tissue IR and liver fibrosis in these patients.

This is the first study to confirm in humans and in vivo a major mechanism of progression to NASH, that has previously been postulated in animal models;8 further, it provides several potentially useful insights for targeted therapies in NASH.

PARAGRAPH

First, adipose tissue IR appears to be the main metabolic determinant of the presence and degree of liver fibrosis in NAFLD, independent of the presence of T2DM and obesity, as our patients with NAFLD had been carefully selected not to be diabetics and the majority of them were non-obese.

PARAGRAPH

Then, the main metabolic parameters of lipid metabolism, i.e. circulating levels of FFAs, rate of lipolysis and degree of IR in the adipose tissue, were all associated with macrophage activation as expressed by sCD163 levels.

However, it is well known that obesity is characterized by accumulation of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages in adipose tissue.26

Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of dysfunctional adipose tissue evoke cellular stress and necrotic adipocyte cell death, activation of innate immune cells, including (tissue) macrophages, and production of chemokines such as the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) that recruit monocytes from the bloodstream, boosting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6).

The end result is an obesity-driven chronic state of low-grade adipose tissue inflammation.27–29

PARAGRAPH

Different findings in obese individuals have been presented on sCD163 levels and adipose tissue.

In one study, sCD163 was associated with visceral adipose tissue (VAT) but not with subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) or intrahepatic lipid, while CD163 mRNA was significantly upregulated in VAT compared with SAT at baseline and significantly downregulated in SAT after bariatric surgery.30

Another study showed that sCD163 was associated directly with CD163 mRNA expression in SAT and inversely with peripheral insulin sensitivity.31

Hence, the second question was whether sCD163 stemmed from fat depots or from the liver.

We are not able to separate the different sources of circulating sCD163, but our findings suggest that in our patients, sCD163 levels predominantly mark macrophage activation in the liver.

In fact, sCD163 levels were not related to the amount of VAT or SAT assessed by MRI, but they were tightly associated with the degree of hepatic fat and with CD163 mRNA expression in the liver, independently of BMI.

These results were also confirmed in the subgroup of non-obese patients with NAFLD.

The correlation between hepatic CD163 and ADAM-17, the metalloprotease involved in the cleavage of CD163, strengthen the hypothesis of a link with macrophage activation.

Further, in our patients, sCD163 levels increased according to the severity of fibrosis at liver biopsy, supporting the intriguing role of macrophage activation in the progression of hepatic damage.8

In recent studies we observed a sCD163 gradient across the liver in patients with NASH and cirrhosis.14,32

In both children and adults, sCD163 is reduced independently of changes in body weight and after life-style intervention and bariatric surgery.14–16

Although a contribution of circulating macrophages stemming from adipose tissue cannot be excluded, our findings support the notion that in NAFLD, adipose tissue IR can favor the activation of hepatic macrophages, thus promoting fibrosis.

This interaction is likely to be an early event in the progression to NASH.

In fact, macrophage expansion was the first difference seen in liver biopsies of patients with steatosis compared to control patients and it was the first step of liver inflammatory activation, preceding the recruitment of other inflammatory cells.33

The pathways involved are not completely understood.

According to a recent report, hepatic lipid accumulation may induce an inflammatory macrophage phenotype through the release of extracellular vesicles from hepatocytes.34

In our patients, the amount of hepatic fat at liver biopsy was proportional to adipose tissue IR and it was related to both soluble and hepatic CD163.

In keeping with the in vivo correlation between lipid fluxes and both sCD163 and hCD163, the exposure of human monocyte-derived macrophages to palmitate enhanced sCD163 shedding, which suggests a direct pathway of macrophage activation by saturated FFAs, of which palmitate is usually the most abundant.

Similarly, in vitro stimulation of murine KCs with palmitic acid increases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and toll-like receptor 4.35

PARAGRAPH

The results of our study challenge the hypothesis that hepatic macrophage activation can induce hepatic and systemic IR.

This hypothesis was based on observations from animal models and in vitro experiments.

In vitro, co-culture of hepatocytes with M1-polarized KCs increased triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes and fatty acid esterification and decreased fatty acid oxidation and insulin responsiveness; these effects were blocked by TNF-a-neutralizing antibodies.9

A short-term high-fat diet model in mice demonstrated early Hep-IR and steatosis concurrent with macrophage activation.

Furthermore, selective KC depletion obtained by intravenous clodronate significantly improved hepatic insulin sensitivity in vivo.10

However, human patients are more heterogeneous than inbred mouse strains, with respect to genetic or environmental factors that might influence macrophage activation.

In our patients, both plasma sCD163 and liver CD163 expression were not related either to Hep-IR or to EGP, suggesting a secondary role of macrophages in the onset of local IR.

Conversely, our data confirm that Hep-IR in humans is mainly driven by liver steatosis, as repeatedly reported.36

The discrepancy with previously published data26 is likely explained by the different study population.

At early stages of metabolic alterations and in the absence of morbid obesity and diabetes, there is no association between derangements of glucose metabolism and macrophage activation in patients with NAFLD.

However, the relationship between hepatic insulin sensitivity and hCD163 can be different in morbidly obese and diabetic individuals, when EGP increases and actively contributes to hyperglycemia.

Thus, in obese and diabetic patients a possible contribution of macrophage activation to the inhibition of insulin signaling in hepatocytes cannot be completely excluded.

PARAGRAPH

A limitation of this study is that conclusions mostly rely on cross-sectional associations and some are rather weak as gauged from the correlation analysis plots.

Experiments have been undertaken with state of the art techniques to allow a careful and reliable measurement of metabolic parameters in humans and in vivo.20,21,37

Overall our results are consistent, in the sense that none of them contradict what we expected from our line of interpretation, or refute this line as the most plausible explanation; this explanation is not fully proven, although it is the best we could achieve in vivo and also rules out the overlapping contribution of diabetes and morbid obesity.

However, we could not find any clear association with necroinflammation.

One possible explanation is that liver biopsy is a snapshot in time of liver damage.

While fibrosis is built up over a long period, the rapid changes over time in necro-inflammatory activity may explain the lack of association with several biomarkers and parameters.

Another challenge with the interpretation of the results is the current histological scoring of ballooning (by definition only 2 max) and lobular inflammation (which is very mild in our patient cohort).

According to the immunohistochemistry, there was an increased presence of activated macrophages, hence inflammation, but the latter can be poorly reflected by the very rough scoring of ballooning and lobular inflammation.

It may be unusual that the inflammation was not more pronounced even in patients fulfilling NASH criteria, but de facto, mild lobular inflammation is common in NASH, a slowly evolving disease.

In 3 large independent cohorts of patients with NAFLD and NASH previously studied by our group, the lobular inflammation score did not exceed 2 (2–4 foci per 200x field).13,14

Notably, the findings of our study represent a paradigm shift regarding the role of macrophages in human hepatic IR.

These results have implications for our understanding of pathogenesis and therapy, by highlighting the strong link between metabolic derangement and local inflammatory responses.

Hepatic macrophages are an attractive target for novel therapeutic approaches to treat fibrotic NASH, as underscored by the antifibrotic effects recently reported by drugs in phase II clinical trials that target macrophages by acting on monocyte recruitment (dual CCR2/CCR5 inhibitor cenicriviroc),38 their inflammatory activation (inhibitor of the serine/threonine kinase ASK1, selonsertib), or on hepatic stellate cells.39

However, none of these studies showed a significant effect on metabolic parameters independent of BMI, thus leaving unaffected the major source of macrophage activation.

Another attractive option could be the combination with agonists of the fatty acid sensor peroxisome proliferator activator-receptor gamma (PPARγ), for their favorable effects on adipose tissue IR, or delta (PPARδ), involved in alternative activation of macrophages and favoring glucose metabolism and fatty acid oxidation.40

Clinical trials with a double PPARα and PPARδ agonist (elafibranor)41 and pan- PPARα, PPARδ and PPARγ agonist (lanifibranor)42 are currently ongoing.

Interestingly, we have previously reported that direct targeting macrophages with an anti-CD163-IgG-dexamethasone conjugate significantly improved fructose diet-induced NASH changes e.g. inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, fibrosis, and glycogen deposition.43

PARAGRAPH

In summary, this in vivo study in non-diabetic patients with NAFLD may suggest a link between activation of resident macrophages in the liver and alterations in adipose tissue IR, while it does not support a link with hepatic glucose metabolism.

Liver macrophages represent an attractive therapeutic target, but it is necessary to consider the potential role of adipose tissue IR in their activation in order to obtain a prolonged and sustainable effect on liver damage in NASH.
