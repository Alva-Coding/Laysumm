TITLE

Coordinated development of the mouse extrahepatic bile duct: Implications for neonatal susceptibility to biliary injury

PARAGRAPH

Biliary atresia is a disease that affects newborns and is characterized by extrahepatic bile duct injury and obstruction, resulting in liver injury.

We identify 4 key differences between the epithelial and submucosal layers of the neonatal and adult extrahepatic bile duct and show that these may render the neonatal duct particularly susceptible to injury.
