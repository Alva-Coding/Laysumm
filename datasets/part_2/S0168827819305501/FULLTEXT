TITLE

Coordinated development of the mouse extrahepatic bile duct: Implications for neonatal susceptibility to biliary injury

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Mammalian bile travels through an arborizing network, encompassing bile canaliculi, the canals of Hering and ductules, and cholangiocyte-lined intrahepatic (IHBD) and extrahepatic (EHBD) bile ducts.

The IHBD and EHBD arise from different primordia: the cranial portion of the endodermal diverticulum gives rise to the liver and the IHBD, while the caudal portion develops into the EHBD.1–3

The EHBD and IHBD, in addition to differing in development, size, and surrounding tissue, are also notable for differential susceptibility to certain cholangiopathies including primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and the neonatal fibro-obliterative disease biliary atresia (BA).

BA, which at the time of presentation primarily affects the EHBD, is specific to neonates, who are born apparently healthy but progress remarkably quickly (within several months) to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.

Recent human and animal model data suggest that the initial insult is prenatal, affecting the neonate but sparing the mother.4–8

This suggests a paradigm whereby the fetal and neonatal ducts, especially the EHBD, are uniquely susceptible to initial and progressive damage from injurious agents.

PARAGRAPH

Bile ducts have specialized anatomical features that protect them from bile acid-mediated injury and other insults.

Specialized protective features of cholangiocytes include unique apical membranes and an apical glycocalyx with a protective “bicarbonate umbrella” layer.9–11

The EHBD submucosa may also have a protective function.

It has recently been described to comprise a fluid-containing interstitial space with a lattice of collagen bundles, elastin, and thin fibroblast-like cells directly adherent to the collagen bundles.12

These features serve a barrier function, provide structural support to the duct, and also likely serve as a shock absorber and a conduit for the movement of soluble and cellular factors.12

PARAGRAPH

The development of these potential protective features in the neonatal EHBD has not been reported.

Similarly, the mechanism of specific neonatal and EHBD susceptibility to injury is unknown, although we and colleagues previously reported that the EHBD has low levels of glutathione compared to the IHBD and liver.13,14

Here we report a detailed anatomical and functional study of the murine EHBD, including mucosal and submucosal layers, from birth through adulthood.

We describe the identification of 4 potentially developmentally coordinated features that may in part explain the particular susceptibility of the neonatal EHBD to injury and fibrosis.

We focused on BALB/c mice; this strain, unlike C57BL/6 and other common laboratory strains, is sensitive to neonatal infection with rhesus rotavirus and is used to generate the widely-used rhesus rotavirus infection model of BA.8

SECTION

Animals

PARAGRAPH

All work with mice was in accordance with protocols that were approved by the University of Pennsylvania and University of California, San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees, as per the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Use and Care of Animals.

Collagen α1(I)-GFP (Col-GFP) mice were as previously described15,16 and were used for experiments in Fig. 7A; these animals were housed at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California, San Diego.

BALB/c mice, which were used for all other duct and cell isolations, were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and housed at the University of Pennsylvania.

Both male and female mice were used for all isolations and experiments; animals were not selected for sex, and numbers of each sex per experiment were roughly equal.

Mice were housed in small barrier cages with nestlings for enrichment; the light/dark cycle was 12 h. Animals were fed standard chow, with both food and water provided ad libitum.

Yucatan pig bile was a gift from Robert Mauck (University of Pennsylvania, PA, USA) and was obtained from animals previously euthanized as part of other studies.

SECTION

Human samples

PARAGRAPH

Anonymized human EHBD sections were obtained from the Anatomic Pathology archives of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, with IRB approval.

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded EHBD sections were obtained from fetuses stillborn at 22, 34, 36 and 39 weeks gestation during the course of autopsies performed with parental consent, and from a native liver explant from a 7-year-old child and a partial hepatectomy specimen resected for a primary pancreatic tumor from a 10 year-old.

SECTION

Histology, immunostaining, and lectin staining

PARAGRAPH

EHBDs and livers were dissected from mice at the ages noted and were either formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded or frozen in O.C.T. (Tissue Tek, VWR, Bridgeport, NJ, USA), then sectioned to 5 µm thickness.

Antibodies used for immunostaining are listed in Tables S1 and S2.

Primary cholangiocytes were grown either in 2D or 3D for immunostaining.

For lectin staining, slides were washed briefly in PBS and stained using biotinylated lectins per the manufacturer’s protocol (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA).

The lectins used are shown in Table S3.

For mucopolysaccharide detection, tissues were stained using Alcian blue.

Nuclei were stained with DAPI.

PARAGRAPH

Further details on staining can be found in the supplementary methods.

SECTION

Transmission electron microscopy

PARAGRAPH

EHBDs and livers from neonatal and adult mice were fixed (2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4) in situ immediately after euthanasia and then dissected and fixed in the same buffer overnight at 4 °C.

After subsequent buffer washes, the samples were post-fixed in 2.0% osmium tetroxide for 1 h at room temperature and rinsed in dH2O prior to en bloc staining with 2% uranyl acetate.

After dehydration through a graded ethanol series, the tissue was infiltrated and embedded in EMbed-812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA, USA).

Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a JEOL 1010 electron microscope (JEOL USA, Peabody, MA, USA) fitted with a Hamamatsu digital camera (Bridgewater, NJ, USA) and AMT Advantage image capture software (Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corp., Woburn, MA, USA).

Ruthenium red staining of the sections was performed as described.11

SECTION

Image analysis

PARAGRAPH

Image analysis was performed using ImageJ.

The thickness of the glycocalyx was measured manually by using the straight-line tool in ImageJ on transmission electron microscope (TEM) images.

Measurements included the cell membrane; 10 random regions were selected from each of 3 independently isolated EHBDs per age group.

To assess the glycocalyx via immunostaining of primary adult cells before and after enzyme treatment, 3D reconstruction of the Z-series stack was performed and orthogonal XZ slices were analyzed using the 3D Simple Segmentation Plugin.

Measurement of collagen diameter in TEM images was done manually using the straight-line tool in ImageJ.

For each age group, 150–300 fibrils were measured in 3–5 independent EHBDs.

Quantification of immunohistochemistry and second harmonic generation (SHG) signals was done using the threshold and % area functions.

All image analysis was carried out in a blinded fashion.

SECTION

Primary cholangiocyte isolation and culture

PARAGRAPH

Primary extrahepatic biliary epithelial cells were isolated from adult and neonatal mice, cultured in BEC media as previously described,17 and used up to passage 3.

Adult primary cells were grown on 18 mm coverslips treated with lysine (18 mm; Cat # 16004-300, VWR International LLC, Radnor, PA).

The coverslips were pre-treated with 0.01% polylysine solution (Sigma P8920) for 1 h followed by 3 × 10 min washes in 1x PBS.

The coverslips were then coated with 1 mg/ml of collagen (rat tail collagen, Corning, 354236) and cells were grown overnight for further experiments.

SECTION

Flow cytometry

PARAGRAPH

Primary adult cholangiocytes were cultured to 80% confluence on a 10 cm plate on collagen at 37 °C.

Cells were trypsinized, suspended in serum-free BEC medium and incubated with or without 0.1 U/ml (Sigma) neuraminidase in serum‐free BEC medium for 2.5 h. Cells were washed with BEC medium containing 10% FBS and were resuspended in Flow Cytometry Staining Buffer (1×) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) supplemented with 1% FBS.

They were incubated with 1 µg/ml of FITC-soybean agglutinin (SBA) lectin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 30 min.

Cells were then washed and resuspended in FACS buffer and analyzed for lectin binding affinity by performing flow cytometry analysis on an LSR II equipped with FACS DiVA software (version 6.1.1; BD).

Measurement in the absence of lectins was performed as a negative control and at least 1 × 104 cells were analyzed for each sample.

Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (version 10; FLOWJO, LLC).

The data were manually gated in FlowJo and then Flow SOM was performed using the plugin installed in the software.18

A minimal spanning tree was constructed to visualize the expression of FITC.

SECTION

Cell viability assays

PARAGRAPH

Adult cholangiocytes were cultured on coverslips as described above and treated with heparinase III or chondroitinase ABC for 2.5 h after which they were immunostained with lectin GSL II (Vector labs, B-1215) or mouse anti-heparan sulfate antibody (HepSS-1; H1890 (10E4 epitope), US Biological Life Science).

Confluent adult cholangiocytes were also cultured on thin collagen cells at 1 mg/ml in 96 well plates.

They were incubated with or without 0.1 U/ml of neuraminidase (Sigma), 1,215 mU/ml of heparinase III (IBEX, Canada) and 135 mU/ml chondroitinase ABC (Sigma) in serum‐free BEC medium for 2.5 h.

The medium was then replaced with BEC medium containing 10% FBS and bile acids or diluents and the cells were treated for 4 h. Stock solutions of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDC) were made in ethanol/DMSO (50:50, v/v); glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDC) stocks were made in HBSS, both at pH 6.8–7.0.

The bile acids were diluted in BEC medium at 1 mM for GCDC and 0.5 mM for CDC.11

Cell viability was assessed by the WST-1 assay (Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

SECTION

Spheroid culture and rhodamine efflux assay

PARAGRAPH

Primary neonatal and adult mouse extrahepatic cholangiocytes were cultured in 3D in a collagen‐Matrigel mixture for 7 days as described previously and were immunostained with ZO-1 antibody (a gift from Jerrold Turner);19 a rhodamine efflux assay was then performed.13

Briefly, cells were incubated in rhodamine 123 for 15 min to load the lumens; live cells were then washed and imaged every 20 min using a spinning disk confocal microscope with a wide 40x lens.

Corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) was measured using ImageJ (v1.48, NIH) as previously described.20

The percentage decrease of fluorescence was calculated using the initial 20 min time point as the reference point.

SECTION

Second harmonic generation imaging

PARAGRAPH

Fixed whole EHBDs were imaged using a Leica SP8 confocal/multiphoton microscope and Coherent Chameleon Vision II Ti:Sapphire laser (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) tuned to a wavelength of 910 nm.

SHG of collagen generates both forward and backward signals; directionality of scatter is dependent on the size and orientation of the fibril, with backward scatter associated with immature fibrils.21

SECTION

In vitro bile diffusion assay

PARAGRAPH

Diffusion of bile acids though the submucosa was assessed by flowing Yucatan pig bile through a 160 µm diameter channel in a collagen/hyaluronic acid (HA) gel.

The changes in the submucosal matrix occurring during development were modeled in this system by using a range of concentrations (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 mg/ml) of rat tail collagen I (Corning, NY, USA) mixed with 0.5 mg/ml high molecular weight (15 MDa) HA (Lifecore Biomedical, Chaska, MN, USA) in a buffered medium (HEPES, NaCO3, NaOH, and DMEM).

The channel was made in the gel mixture by inserting an acupuncture needle before gelation.

A total of 50 µl of Yucatan pig bile (which is autofluorescent) was flowed through the channel and the gel mixture was imaged every 5 seconds for 2 min using an EVOS FL Auto imaging system.

The diffusion rate (D2/(2xT), where D = distance, and T = time) over the first 30 s was calculated for 10–12 gels per collagen concentration.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Statistical significance was assessed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc analysis.

p <0.05 was regarded as statistically significant, and calculated with Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).

An unpaired t test was used to compare spheroid sizes and immunostaining experiments after enzyme treatments with p values <0.05 considered to represent statistical significance.

SECTION

Results

SECTION

Neonatal BALB/c mouse cholangiocytes lack an apical glycocalyx

PARAGRAPH

We first assessed whether neonatal mouse cholangiocytes have an apical glycocalyx, as has been reported for adult human and mouse cholangiocytes.10,22

TEM images of livers and EHBDs from BALB/c mice at multiple time points from postnatal day 0 through adulthood confirmed published data that adults have an apical glycocalyx (Fig. 1).10,11

The glycocalyx of both the EHBD and IHBD of neonates (days 0–2), however, was thin and sparse (Fig. 1A, B and Fig. S1).

The glycocalyx thickness of newborn bile ducts ranged from 6–10 nm; the glycocalyx layer was continuous and increased in thickness to about 20 nm by postnatal day 7 and 25–30 nm in adults (Fig. 1B).

(Note that fixation dehydrates the glycocalyx and it is likely to be significantly thicker in vivo; the relative thickness of different samples, however, holds true.

Apparent gaps in the neonatal glycocalyx, as indicated by red arrowheads in Fig. 1C, may not reflect a complete absence of the glycocalyx.)

Although the glycocalyx was easily visualized by TEM even when unstained, its identity was confirmed by staining with ruthenium red and osmium tetroxide, which bind to glycosaminoglycans present in the glycocalyx (Fig. 1C).23,24

EHBDs were also stained with Alcian blue, which indicated the presence of acidic glycans on the apical surface of adult but not neonatal EHBDs (Fig. 1D).

Thus, BALB/c mice had a poorly developed IHBD and EHBD glycocalyx at birth, although it became continuous and thicker during the first 2 weeks of life.

SECTION

The cholangiocyte glycocalyx varies during development and protects cells from bile toxicity

PARAGRAPH

To understand the complexity of the glycocalyx, we stained neonatal and adult BALB/c mouse EHBD sections using a panel of lectins (Table S3).

Lectins concanavalin A (Con A), Phaseolus vulgaris erythroagglutinin (PHA-E), Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L), peanut agglutinin (PNA), Griffonia (Bandeiraea) simplicifolia (GSL), and soybean (SBA), out of a panel of 12, showed strong binding to the EHBD glycocalyx of adult BALB/c mice (Fig. 2).

The apical surface of neonatal EHBDs, however, remained unstained with all except the PHA-E and SBA lectins, which showed faint discontinuous staining.

Cholangiocytes at postnatal day 7 had light staining with PHA-E, PHA-L, and ConA, as well as staining with the lectin Maackia amurensis II (MAlII), which binds only carbohydrate structures that contain sialic acid in an (α-2,3) linkage; MalII did not stain postnatal day 1 EHBDs or adult bile ducts (Fig. S2).

Lectin staining of well-preserved human EHBDs was consistent with results from mice.

PHA-E staining showed a glycocalyx on the luminal surface of EHBDs from 7- and 10-year-old patients, while there was no PHA-E staining of EHBDs taken from stillborn infants at gestational ages up to 39 weeks (Fig. S3).

These human samples appeared well preserved, but degradation of the glycocalyx in utero cannot be ruled out.

Overall, based on lectin staining, the glycocalyx develops and remodels after the ducts themselves form.

PARAGRAPH

In order to determine whether the glycocalyx plays a protective role in mice, as reported previously for adult human cholangiocytes,11 we isolated pure primary cholangiocytes from adult mouse EHBDs (Fig. S4A), then enzymatically treated them with neuraminidase, which cleaves negatively charged terminal sialic acids in the glycocalyx.10,11

The efficacy of the neuraminidase treatment was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis using adult cholangiocytes labeled with the lectin SBA, which binds to newly exposed sugar residues in the glycocalyx after sialic acid removal (Fig. S4B).10

Neuraminidase-modified adult cholangiocytes were then exposed to the bile salts CDC and GCDC and toxicity was analyzed using a WST-1 assay.

Both CDC and GCDC are known to be toxic because of high pKa values.11

We observed that both these bile acids were toxic to primary cholangiocytes at pH values below 7; however, disruption of the glycocalyx with neuraminidase resulted in increased susceptibility to bile acid-mediated injury (Fig. S4D, left panel).

We also treated the cells with heparinase III and chondroitinase ABC to cleave off large proteoglycans found in the glycocalyx (Fig. S4C, D).

We confirmed the efficacy of the chondroitinase ABC treatment with lectin GSLII staining, and of the heparinase III treatment with anti-heparan sulfate antibody staining25 (Fig. S4D, middle and right panels).

Our results indicate that altering the glycocalyx through the removal of various glycosaminoglycan residues renders cholangiocytes more susceptible to bile acid-induced injury.

SECTION

Cell-cell junctions of neonatal EHBD, not IHBD, are immature

PARAGRAPH

Because cholangiocyte cell-cell junctions are key to protecting the basolateral surfaces of cholangiocytes and the submucosa from bile acid toxicity, we compared these junctions in mice of different ages.

On TEM imaging, junctions in BALB/c mouse EHBDs from birth through postnatal day 7 appeared immature, with poorly developed tight junctions and, in many cases, open channels from apical surface to basement membrane (Fig. 3A).

Note in particular the inter-cholangiocyte space seen in the postnatal day 2 (P2) image; there is a long channel from apical to basal surface filled with multiple protrusions.

This was common in ducts from postnatal days 0 to 4 (P0-P4).

TEM images of IHBD cholangiocytes showed that junctions appeared mature even at postnatal day 0 (P0; Fig. 3B).

Staining for the tight junction protein ZO-1 in spheroids derived from primary adult and neonatal EHBD cholangiocytes also showed less well-developed junctions between neonatal cells (Fig. 3F).

PARAGRAPH

To determine the functional relevance of these differences, we measured leakage of rhodamine 123 from adult and neonatal mouse cholangiocyte spheroids in 3D culture.

This was measured by calculating the corrected total cell fluorescence % decrease (CTCF % decrease).

Rhodamine 123 is a fluorescent dye taken up into cholangiocytes via the basal surface which is then effluxed into the lumen by the apical transporter MDR1 and (to a lesser extent) MRP1.

In studies with adult cholangiocyte spheroids, leakage of rhodamine from the lumen is minimal.13,26,27

Spheroids with well-formed lumens were loaded for 15 min,13 then imaged every 20 min for 120 min to assess leakage (Fig. 3C-E).

Neonatal and adult spheroids were of similar diameters (Fig. S5), although total rhodamine uptake into neonatal lumens was about half that for adult lumens.

Neonatal cholangiocytes demonstrated a rapid loss of signal (Fig. 3C-E), suggesting a higher initial rate of leakage, although the error bars at later time points are large and it is possible that leakage was higher in neonatal cholangiocyte spheroids throughout the period of measurement.

PARAGRAPH

Although cell-cell junctions were immature, other cholangiocyte structures appeared mature even in neonates.

Apical microvilli were abundant on EHBD and IHBD cholangiocytes from mice at all ages, and acetylated-α-tubulin staining was positive for cilia in neonates and adult EHBDs (Fig. 3G and Fig. S6).

SECTION

Collagen is deposited in the EHBD submucosa in the postnatal period

PARAGRAPH

We examined the architecture of the mouse EHBD submucosa as a function of age.

The adult mouse EHBD submucosa, similar to the submucosa of adult human ducts,12 contained a network of collagen bundles.

In contrast, the neonatal (postnatal days 1–4) duct submucosa had only scattered collagen fibers (Fig. 4A, black arrows); the space appeared mostly empty on TEM, and immunostaining showed that it was filled with ground substance (HA and proteoglycans; Figs. 5C and 6).

In neonatal ducts (postnatal day 2), collagen contributed to less than 1% of the duct area, however, in adults this increased to over 20% (Fig. 4D).

Collagen fibril diameter significantly increased from 45 nm to 55 nm between postnatal days 4 and 7 (Fig. 4B), after which the diameter remained the same through adulthood.

EHBDs of all ages were assessed for the presence of fibripositors,28 structures reported to mediate collagen alignment under tension; however, few fibripositors were observed in the EHBD, and these were only in the neonatal EHBD (Fig. S7).

Collagen was deposited first in the outer layer of the duct wall, as shown by SHG microscopy as well as immunostaining for the fibrillar collagens I and III (Figs. 4C, 5A).

PARAGRAPH

To model the effect of increasing collagen deposition on interstitial flow through the EHBD submucosa, mixtures of high molecular weight HA (0.5 mg/ml) and increasing collagen I concentrations (0.25–5 mg/ml) were gelled around a 160 µm needle to form a channel and the diffusion rate of bile from the channel into the matrix mixture was measured (Fig. 5D).

Diffusion rates were inversely correlated with collagen concentration, suggesting that bile leakage into the submucosa may be limited more in the adult EHBD (by virtue of its increased collagen) than in the neonatal EHBD.

SECTION

ECM composition in the EHBD submucosa varies with age

PARAGRAPH

The composition of the ECM in the EHBD submucosa changed markedly with age.

In adults, the submucosa contained collagens I, III (small amounts) and IV, fibronectin, HA and the proteoglycans lumican, decorin, fibromodulin and versican, but not the proteoglycans biglycan and aggrecan (Figs. 5A-C, 6, and Fig. S8).

Collagen IV was found at the edge of the outer wall, as well as along the basement membrane (with a thick layer of elastin), while versican deposition was concentrated around the submucosal cells under the cholangiocyte layer (Fig. 5A).

In contrast, the neonatal duct had no or little collagen I, III, or elastin (Fig. 5A, B), suggesting decreased tissue integrity and ability to respond to mechanical stress.

The neonatal submucosa did, however, contain proteoglycans (although not fibromodulin) and HA (Figs. 5C and 6).

Notably, lumican, which plays a role in collagen fibrillogenesis, was more highly expressed in neonatal EHBDs (Fig. 6B).

Lectin staining of the submucosa with PHA-L, ConA and PHA-E showed that specific glycosaminoglycan epitopes change with age (Fig. 2).

Thus, the amount and composition of the extracellular matrix in the submucosal space changed markedly with age, suggesting the potential for significant differences in submucosal fluid flow, cell movement and mechanical properties including the response to obstruction.

SECTION

Neonatal submucosal cells are fibrogenic

PARAGRAPH

TEM images showed that the submucosal cells of the EHBD varied in morphology with age (Fig. 4A).

In adult mouse ducts, most submucosal cells were flat, with long thin projections that surrounded and directly adhered to adjacent collagen bundles, as has been reported for human ducts (Fig. 4A and12).

These cells had little rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER).

In neonates, however, most submucosal cells were round and contained large amounts of RER, suggesting high synthetic activity.

The presence of cells actively secreting collagen was confirmed in neonates but not adults, by using neonatal Col-GFP reporter mice, which showed significantly more GFP expression in neonates than in adults (Fig. 7A).

The submucosal cells in the developing neonatal duct were highly proliferative, as shown by Ki67 staining (Fig. 7C, D).

TUNEL staining demonstrated that these cells were also less apoptotic, suggesting that turnover of cells during postnatal development of the EHBD was minimal (Fig. 7C, E).

PARAGRAPH

In EHBD of all ages, the majority of cells stained positively for the mesenchymal and fibroblast cell markers vimentin, CD34 and PDGFRβ (Fig. 7B).

In adults, the expression pattern of CD34 varied with the relative position of the cells within the submucosa, with expression at its highest in the outer layer of the duct.

α-SMA staining was observed, as expected given the Col-GFP data, in the smooth muscle cells surrounding vessels in both the neonate and adult; however, a subpopulation of the CD34- and vimentin-positive cells in the neonatal submucosa also stained for α-SMA.

A second subpopulation of submucosal cells, present most prominently at postnatal day 7 (P7), expressed the mesenchymal stem cell marker CD105.

No fat droplets were seen in any fibroblast-like cells on TEM analysis, suggesting that they are not retinoid-storing like hepatic or pancreatic stellate cells.

The submucosa of the EHBD was also interspersed with F4/80 positive macrophages and was crossed by nerves (Figs. S9 and S10).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

We report here a systematic study of the postnatal development of the murine EHBD mucosa and submucosa that has implications for understanding why neonatal ducts are uniquely targeted for injury in BA.

We identify 4 major differences between neonates and adults: 1) neonatal cholangiocytes lack a protective apical glycocalyx; 2) neonatal EHBD tight junctions in the cholangiocyte monolayer are immature and cholangiocytes from neonates are leakier than from adults; 3) the neonatal submucosa lacks the major structural proteins collagen I and elastin, potentially impacting diffusion of bile leaked into the submucosal space, as well as the mechanical properties of the duct; and 4) the neonatal submucosa contains proliferative cells that are actively secreting collagen even in the absence of injury.

Collectively, these suggest that the neonatal EHBD has increased susceptibility to injury and fibrosis.

PARAGRAPH

The apical glycocalyx is thought to incorporate a “bicarbonate umbrella” and to serve as an important defense mechanism protecting cholangiocytes from bile acids, particularly those like GCDC with high pKa values.10,22

Published work shows that human and mouse adult cholangiocytes express a sialated apical glycocalyx with a high concentration of α1-2 fucose links, and that bile acid-induced cholangiocyte damage is worse when this glycocalyx is disrupted with agents such as neuraminidase.10

Our TEM and lectin staining shows that this glycocalyx layer is thin and discontinous in BALB/c mice in the first few days of life, and that it is similarly absent before birth in the human EHBD.

Human bile is more toxic than mouse bile, suggesting the possibility that the glycocalyx plays an even greater protective role in human than in mouse neonatal cholangiocytes.

PARAGRAPH

Characterization of the glycocalyx via lectin binding offers insight into the composition and abundance of certain sugars and highlights age-related differences in the glycoconjugate composition of the glycocalyx.17,29

The PNA lectin, which recognizes only unsialylated galactose residues,30 only bound to the EHBD glycocalyx in adults.

The SNA lectin, which binds to sialic acid attached to terminal galactoses via α-2,6 and to a lesser degree α-2,3 linkages, strongly stained the glycocalyx of adult cholangiocytes; while SBA, which preferentially binds to oligosaccharide structures with terminal α- or β-linked N-acetylgalactosamines, stained both adult and neonatal glycocalyces.

PARAGRAPH

To investigate the functional relevance of the glycocalyx in cholangiocytes, we performed bile acid toxicity studies with or without enzymatic modification of the glycocalyx.

Desialylation of adult human cholangiocytes lowers their resistance to toxicity induced by both GCDC and CDC.10,11

As previously described,10,11 both GCDC and CDC have high pKas and both exerted toxic effects at pH <7.0 on adult EHBD cholangiocytes, which sustained further damage when the glycocalyx had been enzymatically modified.

Collectively, TEM and lectin staining (highlighting the immature state of the glycocalyx in neonatal mice), and functional data on the protective role of the glycocalyx offer a compelling mechanism for neonatal susceptibility to injury.

PARAGRAPH

Intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocytes are developmentally distinct1–3 and the IHBD develops later than the EHBD.

Previous reports described immature cell-cell junctions in intrahepatic cholangiocytes in mice as late as 1 week postnatal.31,32

Our TEM studies show that neonatal IHBD cholangiocytes are compact and well organized.

Neonatal EHBD cholangiocytes, however, have loosely formed cell-cell junctions and gaps running between them and have reduced tight junction protein ZO-1.

Our results are based on TEM analysis of intact tissues from BALB/c mice, while previous studies were performed using primary cell lines isolated from neonatal and adult C57BL/6 mouse livers.32

Our findings and the published work are consistent, however, in showing higher permeability of cholangiocyte monolayers from neonatal compared to adult cells.

As with the glycocalyx, this suggests increased susceptibility to bile acid-mediated damage in the neonatal duct, although in this case primarily the EHBD.

PARAGRAPH

Neonatal EHBDs lack collagen and elastin, suggesting that the mechanical properties of the neonatal duct differ from the adult duct.

In arteries, elastin and collagen provide resistance to stretch at low and high pressures, respectively, and data from knockout mice suggest that elastin is also necessary for reducing energy loss during loading and unloading.33

Our data thus imply that neonatal ducts have a decreased ability to respond appropriately to mechanical stresses such as that resulting from obstruction.

PARAGRAPH

Small leucine-rich proteoglycans (such as lumican, decorin and fibromodulin) and large proteoglycans (such as versican) regulate collagen fibrillogenesis.34–38

We show here that these proteoglycans as well as HA are present in the EHBD during the postnatal deposition of collagen I. Only lumican and fibromodulin, however, demonstrate altered expression during the postnatal development of the EHBD.

Lumican and fibromodulin are also expressed in a sequential manner in developing tendons;35 knock out and in vitro studies suggest that the 2 proteoglycans mediate the stabilization and destabilization of intermediates necessary for fibril growth into mature bundles,35,39 raising the possibility that these proteoglycans play a similar role in the development of the EHBD.

PARAGRAPH

The EHBD submucosa is an interstitial space with active fluid flow.12

Here we show that, in an in vitro model of the submucosal matrix, increasing concentrations of collagen in HA lead to a reduction in the diffusion of bile.

Although this model has limitations (including that the collagen was non-aligned and the ECM lacked the complexity of the submucosa in vivo), it suggests that bile leakage into the submucosa is less contained and therefore potentially more damaging in the neonate than the adult.

Thus, we suggest the immature biliary mucosa (with a sparse glycocalyx and leaky cell-cell junctions) may be mechanistically linked to the immature submucosa (lacking collagen and elastin), the combination leading to bile acid-induced injury, potentially explaining in part neonatal susceptibility to injury.

PARAGRAPH

The neonatal submucosa may also be important in the response to bile duct injury.

The cells of the EHBD submucosa and their responses to bile acids or other agents have not been well characterized.

We previously showed that in the human adult, these cells are CD34, vimentin and D2-40 positive but do not stain for lymphovascular (CD31, ERG or LYVE-1) or stem cell (CD117 or nuclear β catenin) markers, suggesting that they are either fibroblasts or a form of mesenchymal stem cells.12

Here, we have confirmed that in the mouse, cells in the submucosal space are mostly fibroblasts (staining positive for CD34, vimentin and PDGFRβ).

The population appears heterogeneous, however, there are also αSMA-negative, CD105-negative and vimentin/CD34-positive cells in the adult.

Larger percentages of α-SMA-negative and CD105-positive cells are present in neonatal than in adult EHBDs.

Additionally, in contrast to cells in the adult submucosa, the majority of cells in the neonatal submucosa are actively producing collagen.

This suggests that neonatal submucosal cells have high fibrogenic potential and raises the interesting possibility that injury to the neonatal EHBD occurs in an environment that is primed for fibrosis.

If these cells persist in a quiescent state in the adult, it will be important to determine whether they reactivate after injury, in particular in sclerotic biliary diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis with its classical “onion-skin fibrosis” or cholangiocarcinoma.

PARAGRAPH

Taken as a whole, our data show that neonatal bile ducts, especially the EHBD, are anatomically and functionally immature – with a sparse glycocalyx, leaky cholangiocyte cell-cell junctions, a structurally undeveloped submucosal matrix, and cells actively secreting collagen – such that they are likely to be highly susceptible to injury and fibrosis.

Nonetheless, BA is a rare disease and the majority of babies do not develop BA in spite of a window of vulnerability when bile flow commences while they still have immature ducts.

There is almost certainly an additional insult, which, when it occurs in the context of a susceptible duct, leads to significant injury.

What this insult is, how commonly it occurs and how often it causes injury, and the typical degree of associated repair are not known.

Our work is a first step in understanding potential mechanisms of BA and other forms of neonatal bile duct injury,11 and may have implications for the understanding of duct injury in adult sclerosing biliary diseases as well.
