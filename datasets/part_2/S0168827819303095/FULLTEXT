TITLE

Interferon-γ-dependent immune responses contribute to the pathogenesis of sclerosing cholangitis in mice

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a poorly understood chronic progressive biliary disease of unknown aetiology, characterized by biliary inflammation and fibrosis, development of cholestasis, end-stage liver disease and a high risk of malignancy.

Approximately 60% of patients with PSC are male and 70 to 80% have inflammatory bowel disease.

Both the incidence and prevalence of PSC are increasing, indicating that current medical treatment is poorly effective.1

PARAGRAPH

PSC has been recognized as an immune-mediated biliary disease.

Genetic data provided insight into immunological loci belonging to a general pool of predisposing autoimmune risk factors, most strikingly human leukocyte antigen (HLA) associations that resemble prototypical autoimmune disorders.2

This suggests that T cell-dependent, adaptive immune responses contribute to the immunopathogenesis of PSC.

Indeed, dysregulation of apoptosis of activated CD4+ T cells3 and dysfunction of regulatory T cells4 have been observed in patients with PSC.

Additionally, studies in patients with PSC showed increased T lymphocyte infiltration with a bias towards Th1 cells that localize around the bile ducts and portal tracts.5,6

Moreover, elevated serum levels of the IFNγ-inducible chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 have been determined in patients with PSC,7 and biliary epithelial cells from patients with PSC express CXCL9, CXCL10 and the IFNγ-specific transcription factors STAT1 and IRF1.8

PARAGRAPH

Mdr2−/− mice, bearing a targeted disruption of the multidrug resistance gene (Mdr2, Abcb4), have been recognized as a suitable model to study inflammatory biliary disease.9

In fact, reflecting central morphological features observed in livers of patients with PSC, biliary inflammation, ductular proliferation and onion skin type periductual fibrosis are typical signatures of liver histopathology in Mdr2−/− mice.10

Bile duct injury upon deletion of the phospholipid flippase Mdr2 develops as a consequence of defective biliary phospholipid secretion, which results in a subsequent increase of free non-micellar and therefore potentially toxic bile acid concentrations in bile.9,10

The murine Mdr2 gene represents the human orthologue MDR-39,10 and mutations in MDR-3 have been associated with biliary injury.11

Interestingly, T effector cells seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of experimental sclerosing cholangitis in Mdr2−/− mice, since expansion of endogenous regulatory T cells have been demonstrated to diminish biliary injury and fibrosis in these animals.12

PARAGRAPH

IFNγ has been implicated in autoimmunity13 and a Th1 response has been associated with PSC.5,6

However, the functional relevance has never been investigated in humans or in the Mdr2−/− mouse model so far.

Thus, we aimed to study its cellular source as well as its role in liver inflammation and fibrosis in this mouse model of PSC.

Our results demonstrated increased IFNγ serum levels in patients with PSC.

In Mdr2−/− mice, hepatic CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells were the main producers of IFNγ and hepatic expression of IFNγ-inducible chemokines was enhanced.

Using Mdr2−/− x Ifng−/− mice, we observed that IFNγ changed the phenotype of hepatic CD8+ T cells and NK cells towards increased cytotoxicity, induced a pro-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages and aggravated liver fibrosis.

The profibrotic effect of IFNγ in Mdr2−/− mice was confirmed by treatment of these animals with a neutralizing anti-IFNγ antibody.

In patients with PSC, we observed enhanced frequencies of hepatic CD56bright NK cells and a bias towards CD56bright NK cells expressing the cytotoxic molecule TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL).

Quantification of IFNγ-producing T cells and NK cells in Mdr2−/− mice

PARAGRAPH

Mdr2−/− mice on the C57Bl/6 background18 develop chronic biliary inflammation and fibrosis within 12 weeks.14,19

Compared to age-matched C57Bl/6 control mice, Mdr2−/− mice showed significantly elevated plasma ALT, AST, and ALP levels whereas bilirubin was not altered.

Moreover, liver inflammation, assessed by the mHAI score, and markers of fibrosis including hydroxyproline liver tissue concentrations, hepatic Col3a1 (collagen type III alpha 1 chain) gene expression, and degree of Sirius red staining were strongly increased in Mdr2−/− mice (Fig. S1).

PARAGRAPH

Since the major IFNγ-producing cells are T lymphocytes and NK cells, we analysed IFNγ-production by liver lymphocyte populations isolated from 12-week-old Mdr2−/− and C57Bl/6 control mice using flow cytometry.

As shown in Fig. 1A and B, the main producers of IFNγ were CD8+ T cells and NK cells.

Significantly increased amounts of IFNγ production by lymphocytes from Mdr2−/− mice compared to WT mice were particularly observed in CD8+ T cells (Fig. 1B).

We further performed quantitative RT-PCR analysis of liver tissue gene expression levels of the IFNγ-inducible chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl10, which were significantly increased in Mdr2−/− mice compared to C57Bl/6 control animals (Fig. 1C).

Interestingly, analysis of IFNγ serum levels showed increased serum concentrations of IFNγ in patients with PSC compared to healthy controls (Fig. 1D).

We further demonstrated elevated serum IFNγ levels in patients with other chronic liver diseases such as PBC and AIH (Fig. S2).

SECTION

T cell depletion reduced IFNγ production as well as liver injury in Mdr2−/− mice

PARAGRAPH

Since liver CD8+ T cells produced increased amounts of IFNγ and expression levels of chemokines necessary for T cell and NK cell recruitment were significantly increased in livers of Mdr2−/− mice, we measured their accumulation in liver tissue of Mdr2−/− vs. control animals.

As shown in Fig. 2A, numbers of TCRβ+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NKT cells, and NK cells (gating strategies: Fig. S3A) were significantly enhanced in livers of Mdr2−/− mice compared to C57Bl/6 control animals.

In a first attempt, we aimed at analysing the contribution of all IFNγ-producing lymphocytes, i.e. T cells and NK cells, to liver pathophysiology in Mdr2−/− mice by in vivo depletion of these cells.

In C57Bl/6 mice, most lymphocytes express CD90.2 on their surface.

Treatment of Mdr2−/− mice with a CD90.2 depletion antibody (anti-Thy1.2) twice a week for 2 weeks, resulted in almost complete depletion of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NKT cells in the liver (Fig. 2B).

In contrast, hepatic γδ T cells, which produced less IFNγ in Mdr2−/− compared to control mice (Fig. 1B) and which represented only a minority of liver T cells in Mdr2−/− mice (Fig. 2A), and NK cells were hardly affected by the depletion antibody (Fig. 2B).

T cell depletion resulted in a significant reduction of Ifng mRNA expression in liver tissue (Fig. 2C).

Moreover, IFNγ secretion by ex vivo re-stimulated residual liver leucocytes, including monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils and NK cells, was attenuated (Fig. 2D).

Besides attenuation of IFNγ secretion, these cells produced significantly reduced amounts of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-17 and IL-2 (Fig. S3B).

Interestingly, liver NK cells still produced IFNγ but seemed to be less cytotoxic in the absence of T cells, as determined by significantly decreased numbers of NKp46+ NK cells expressing the degranulation marker CD107a (Fig. 2E).

Serum ALT activities were also significantly decreased following T cell depletion (Fig. 2F) while we did not observe differences in ALP and bilirubin levels (data not shown).

Liver inflammation, assessed by the mHAI score, tended to be reduced (Fig. 2G).

However, development of fibrosis remained largely unaffected (Fig. 2H-J).

Accordingly, serum ALT activities were significantly reduced in Mdr2−/− x Rag1−/− mice, which lack T and B cells as a result of the Rag1 deletion, compared to Mdr2−/− mice, while the appearance of fibrosis remained unaffected (Fig. 2K and L).

SECTION

Frequencies of hepatic NK cells and T cells in patients with PSC

PARAGRAPH

Since we determined elevated frequencies of hepatic NK cells and CD8+ T cells in Mdr2−/− mice that might play a role in the pathogenesis of PSC, we further analysed T cell and NK cell frequencies in livers of patients with PSC compared to control patients undergoing liver resection due to tumour metastases.

As shown in Fig. 3, while frequencies of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were unaltered (Fig. 3A), frequencies of hepatic NK cells, in particular those of CD56bright NK cells, which are supposed to represent a liver-resident NK cell population,20 were significantly increased in livers of patients with PSC.

Moreover, we observed a bias towards increased frequencies of CD56bright NK cells expressing the pro-apoptotic molecule TRAIL in livers of patients with PSC (Fig. 6B; gating strategy: Fig. S4).

In the control group, 3 of 6 patients had cholestasis assessed by elevated levels of ALP and GGT (Table S2).

However, the frequencies of NK cell populations did not correlate with cholestasis in these patients (data not shown).

SECTION

Depletion of NK cells in Mdr2-/- mice reduced cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells and exerted an antifibrotic effect

PARAGRAPH

Since both, NK cells and CD8+ T cells were enhanced in livers of Mdr2−/− mice and depletion of CD8+ lymphocytes in juvenile Mdr2−/− mice has recently been reported to exert hepatoprotective effects,12 we depleted NK cells in 10-week-old Mdr2−/− mice using the NKp46-specific anti-asialo GM1 antibody and analysed disease pathology of the animals at an age of 12 weeks.

As shown in Fig. 4A, NK cell depletion was efficient and spared the T cell subpopulations.

NK cell depletion resulted in significantly reduced IFNγ-production and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells, assessed by expression of the cytotoxic effector molecule granzyme B (GzmB) and TRAIL (Fig. 4B).

Lack of NK cells did not affect liver injury and inflammation (Fig. 4C, D) but interestingly, impaired development of fibrosis (Fig. 4E-G).

SECTION

Genetic ablation of Ifng in Mdr2−/− mice reduced cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells and NK cells and exerted an antifibrotic effect

PARAGRAPH

In order to determine the functional role of IFNγ for liver injury in Mdr2−/− mice, we generated Mdr2−/− x Ifng−/− double knockout mice.

As expected, IFNγ was not detectable in T cells and NK cells isolated from livers of Mdr2−/− x Ifng−/− mice (Fig. 5A).

Hepatic gene expression of the IFNγ-inducible chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 was significantly decreased in Mdr2−/− x Ifng−/− mice compared to Mdr2−/− mice (Fig. 5B).

Accordingly, recruitment of T cells and NK cells to the liver was significantly reduced in Mdr2−/− x Ifng−/− mice (Fig. 5C).

Interestingly, IFNγ affected the phenotype of hepatic CD8+ T cells and NK cells in Mdr2−/− mice.

We observed increased frequencies of CD8+ T cells expressing GzmB in Mdr2−/− mice compared to C57Bl/6 controls (Fig. 5D).

The frequencies of both GzmB+ CD8+ T cells and GzmB+ NK cells were significantly reduced in Mdr2−/− x Ifng−/− mice.

Moreover, frequencies of CD8+ T cells and NK cells expressing TRAIL were significantly increased in Mdr2−/− mice compared to C57Bl/6 controls and TRAIL+ CD8+ T cells and TRAIL+ NK cells were significantly reduced in Mdr2−/− x Ifng−/− mice compared to Mdr2−/− mice (Fig. 5D).

PARAGRAPH

In order to examine other possible IFNγ-induced inflammatory responses, we analysed the accumulation of pro-inflammatory macrophages in livers of Mdr2−/− mice, which is critical for liver injury and fibrosis in mouse models of sclerosing cholangitis as recently described.21

We observed a significant increase of infiltrating CD11b+CCR2+ monocyte-derived macrophages co-expressing CX3CR122 in Mdr2−/− mice compared to C57Bl/6 mice, and a significant decrease of restorative CD11b+CX3CR1+ macrophages, which do not express CCR2 (Fig. 5E, gating strategy: Fig. S5).

Accordingly, hepatic expression of the CCR2+ cell recruiting chemokine Ccl2 was significantly increased in Mdr2−/− vs. C57Bl/6 mice (Fig. 5F).

Importantly, Mdr2−/− x Ifng−/− mice showed a tendency towards lower hepatic expression levels of Ccl2 and reduced frequencies of inflammatory CD11b+CCR2+ and CD11b+CX3CR1+CCR2+ monocyte-derived macrophages but significantly increased frequencies of restorative CD11b+CX3CR1+ macrophages compared to Mdr2−/− mice (Fig. 5E,F), indicating reduced liver inflammation in Mdr2−/− mice in the absence of IFNγ.

PARAGRAPH

As we observed lower frequencies of cytotoxic CD8+ T and NK cells in livers of Mdr2−/− x Ifng−/− mice compared to Mdr2−/− mice, we analysed liver cell death using TUNEL staining.

As shown in Fig. 6A, TUNEL-positive hepatocytes were almost absent in Mdr2−/− x Ifng−/− mice compared to massive cell death observed in livers of Mdr2−/− mice.

However, despite the virtual absence of TUNEL+ liver cells, serum ALT activities were not affected in Mdr2−/− x Ifng−/− mice compared to Mdr2−/− mice, although serum AST levels were significantly reduced (Fig. 6B).

In addition, despite reduced frequencies of inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages in the absence of IFNγ, liver inflammation as detected by the mHAI score (Fig. 6C) was not affected.

However, we observed a significant reduction of liver fibrosis in the absence of IFNγ, as demonstrated by significantly reduced fibrosis markers, including hydroxyproline tissue concentrations (Fig. 6D), degree of Sirius red staining (Fig. 6E) and Col3a1 gene expression (Fig. 6F).

Since IFNγ was described to exert either pro-23 or antifibrotic24 effects, we performed additional experiments using an appropriate IFNγ-neutralizing antibody.

As shown in Fig. 6G, administration of the anti-IFNγ antibody twice a week for 2 weeks to Mdr2−/− mice also decreased fibrogenesis in these animals.

Hence, our data strongly indicate that IFNγ has a profibrotic effect in Mdr2−/− mice thereby driving disease pathology.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this report, we analysed the role of IFNγ in chronic biliary disease.

We observed increased IFNγ serum concentrations in patients with PSC in a concentration range similar to the significantly elevated IFNγ levels detected in patients with PBC and AIH, corroborating previous results demonstrating a Th1-type immune response in PBC and AIH.7

In addition, we recently determined significantly increased serum concentrations of the IFNγ-inducible chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL11 in patients with PSC.25

This finding underscores previous findings by others, who detected increased accumulation of IFNγ-producing T cells and IFNγ-inducible downstream molecules in livers of patients with PSC.5,8

Since the functional role of IFNγ on the immunopathogenesis of PSC has not been investigated so far, we used the well-described Mdr2−/− mouse model of chronic biliary disease resembling PSC.9,10

Biliary disease in these animals has previously been thought to depend on the accumulation of toxic bile acids,10 however, emerging evidence also argues for a role of immune cells, particularly IL-17-producing T cell subsets, in mediating liver injury and fibrosis in Mdr2−/− mice.26,27

Here we observed that CD8+ T cells and NKT cells produced significantly increased amounts of IFNγ in Mdr2−/− mice compared to C57Bl/6 controls, however, CD8+ T cells and NK cells showed the highest frequencies of IFNγ-producing cells.

TCRβ+ T cells significantly increased in livers of Mdr2−/− mice compared to C57Bl/6 controls, and the most obvious and significant increase was again observed in the CD8+ T cell and NK cell subpopulations, however, CD4+ T cells and NKT cells also produced IFNγ.

In order to investigate whether these cells contribute to liver injury in Mdr2−/− mice, we depleted CD90.2+ cells using an anti-CD90.2 antibody.

CD90.2 is primarily expressed by T cells.

Our results demonstrated that in contrast to γδ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NKT cells were largely depleted by the antibody while frequencies of NK cells were reduced but still detectable.

CD90.2+ cell depletion resulted in a significant decrease of hepatic Ifng expression, however, the remaining NK cells still produced IFNγ.

Interestingly, lower frequencies of NK cells expressing the degranulation marker CD107a were detectable, which might be a result of reduced production of IL-2 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, which induce cytotoxicity of NK cells.28

As a consequence, serum ALT activities were significantly reduced following CD90.2+ cell depletion.

The mHAI score showed only a tendency towards reduced inflammation, however, this score is less sensitive than quantitative determination of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which were significantly reduced in antibody-treated mice.

In contrast, development of liver fibrosis was not affected by the absence of T cells.

Similar effects were observed in Mdr2−/− x Rag−/− mice, which lack T and B cells, but not NK cells.

These results indicate that T cells are the primary producers of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IFNγ, IL-17 and TNFα, thereby mediating liver injury in Mdr2−/− mice.

However, the residual production of IFNγ by NK cells might have contributed to liver fibrosis, which was neither reduced in Mdr2−/− x Rag1−/− mice nor following CD90.2+ cell depletion.

Indeed, a profibrotic effect of IFNγ has previously been described in experimental steatohepatitis.23

PARAGRAPH

In order to further elucidate the role of IFNγ for NK cell cytotoxicity and liver fibrosis in sclerosing cholangitis, we generated Mdr2−/− x Ifng−/− mice.

These animals displayed reduced numbers of hepatic T cells and NK cells.

Most strikingly, frequencies of NK cells and CD8+ T cells expressing the cytotoxic effector molecules GzmB or TRAIL were significantly reduced in Mdr2−/− x Ifng−/− compared to Mdr2−/− mice.

The reduction of lymphocyte cytotoxicity in the absence of IFNγ can be explained by the observation that the cytotoxic function of CD8+ T cells is enhanced by autocrine production of IFNγ.29

Likewise, NK cell activation is promoted by several cytokines including IFNγ.28

PARAGRAPH

We further showed that depletion of NK cells impaired expression of inflammatory and cytotoxic molecules by CD8+ T cells.

This is in line with previous studies demonstrating that besides their own cytotoxic function, NK cells activate Th1 and CD8+ T cell responses during viral infection, which is triggered by NK cell-mediated activation of dendritic cells (DCs) driving polarisation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and Th1 cells.30

Moreover, upon exposure to tumour cells, NK cells were shown to attract DCs, which start to express chemokines that recruit effector CD8+ T cells to the tumour environment.

This mechanism seems to support the tumouricidal activity of NK cells.31

In addition, NK cells have been shown to promote CD8+ T cell responses against cytomegalovirus (CMV).

Here, NK cells control CMV early, leading to impaired activation of immunosuppressive plasmacytoid DCs, while conventional DCs were activated and accelerated antiviral CD8+ T cell responses.32

Furthermore, a direct interaction of NK cells and CD8+ T cells has been shown in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

In contrast to CMV infection, CD8+ T cells were impaired during chronic HBV infection, which has been attributed to TRAIL-mediated killing of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells by NK cells, while CMV-specific CD8+ T cells from the same patient remained unaffected.

Moreover, Epstein–Barr virus- and influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cells from patients with chronic HBV infection were not affected by NK cell killing.33

Hence, it seems that NK cell-induced killing of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells is specific for this virus.

Moreover, several other mechanisms for the impairment of the HBV-specific CD8+ T cell response during chronic infection have been proposed.34

Thus, the findings discussed above point to a role of NK cells in CD8+ T cell activation through stimulation and recruitment of DCs, and you might speculate that by this mechanism, NK cells also contribute to activation of CD8+ T cells in Mdr2−/− mice.

PARAGRAPH

It has previously been shown that depletion of CD8+ T cells between the second and fourth week of life decreased levels of ALP in juvenile Mdr2−/− mice.12

However, in explant livers of patients with PSC undergoing liver transplantation, we observed unaltered frequencies of hepatic CD8+ T cells compared to controls.

In contrast, liver NK cells, in particular those that have been described to exhibit a liver-resident phenotype,20 were significantly elevated in the explant livers of patients with PSC, showing a bias towards increased TRAIL expression.

It has been shown that direct activation of NK cells by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid or IFNγ induced killing of hepatic stellate cells and attenuated the severity of liver fibrosis in murine models.24

However, although IFNγ was described to abrogate profibrogenic TGFβ signalling in hepatic stellate cells in vitro,35 IFNγ deficiency prevented hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in a chronic steatohepatitis model, which was associated with a reduction of macrophage accumulation in the liver.23

Indeed, it has been shown recently that CCR2+ inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages mediate fibrosis in a mouse model of sclerosing cholangitis.21

Since we observed an inhibition of hepatic CCR2+ macrophage accumulation in Mdr2−/− x Ifng−/− mice, it would be conceivable that IFNγ indirectly accelerates hepatic fibrosis in sclerosing cholangitis via recruitment of inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages.

PARAGRAPH

Macrophages are activated by damage-associated molecular patterns, which are generated in response to hepatocellular damage.

We have observed a reduced cytotoxic phenotype of CD8+ T cells and NK cells along with a strong inhibition of liver cell death in Mdr2−/− x Ifng−/− mice compared to Mdr2−/− mice.

A critical role of NK cells for the pathogenesis of sclerosing cholangitis in the Mdr2−/− mouse model was further demonstrated by depression of the inflammatory and cytotoxic phenotype of CD8+ T cells as well as by reduction of liver fibrosis upon NK cell depletion.

Notably, gene variation analysis indicated a significant reduction of HLA alleles specific for inhibitory NK cell receptors in patients with PSC.36

Moreover, genetic variations were also observed in a ligand for the activating NKG2D receptor, the major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related molecule MIC-A, which has been proposed as a candidate locus for HLA-encoded disease susceptibility to PSC.37

Hepatic NK cells display a pronounced cytotoxic phenotype.28

Indeed, we observed a relatively high frequency of GzmB+ NK cells in C57Bl/6 mice that was not further enhanced in Mdr2−/− mice but significantly reduced in the absence of IFNγ.

Also, hepatic NK cells constitutively express TRAIL,28 which is highly upregulated by viral infection in the liver.38

In our mouse studies, we demonstrated a strong upregulation of TRAIL in hepatic NK cells from Mdr2−/− mice, which was significantly reduced in Mdr2−/− x Ifng−/− mice.

Interestingly, cholangiocytes of patients with PSC express increased amounts of the TRAIL receptor 5 arguing for TRAIL-dependent lysis of these cells by NK cells.39

Moreover, agonistic anti-TRAIL receptor 5 antibodies induced cholangitis and cholestatic liver injury in mice showing the typical histological appearance reminiscent of human PSC.37

Hence, IFNγ is likely to induce cholangiocyte and/or hepatocyte death by enhancing NK cell cytotoxicity, which finally results in activation of inflammatory macrophages and development of fibrosis.

Taken together, our study demonstrates that IFNγ-dependent immune responses may represent checkpoints for therapeutic intervention in sclerosing cholangitis.
