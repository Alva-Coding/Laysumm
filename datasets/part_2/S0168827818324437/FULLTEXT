TITLE

Longitudinal correlations between MRE, MRI-PDFF, and liver histology in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: Analysis of data from a phase II trial of selonsertib

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) characterized by the presence of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning with or without fibrosis.1

Patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis are at greatest risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality.2–5

The global prevalence of NASH is between 1.5% and 6.5%.6

Widespread screening is not currently feasible given that a definitive diagnosis of NASH can only be made through identification of the characteristic histopathologic pattern on liver biopsy.7

While liver biopsy remains the gold standard, its disadvantages are well known.

It is an invasive procedure that can lead to serious complications, including hospitalization for pain, bleeding, and, in rare cases, death.8,9

Few patients are willing to undergo repeat biopsies necessary to monitor disease progression and to evaluate treatment response in trials of experimental therapeutic agents.

Moreover, the interpretation of biopsy results is subject to variability due in part to inter- and intra-observer differences; the risk of sampling error is high due to the patchy nature of the histopathologic lesions in NASH; and biopsy is not able to discriminate intermediate stages of fibrosis.10–13

There is a pressing unmet medical need for reliable and accurate non-invasive tools to evaluate steatosis and fibrosis in patients with NASH, and to monitor response to treatment.

PARAGRAPH

Two magnetic resonance-based imaging technologies have shown promise as non-invasive assessments of patients with NASH.

Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is a quantitative imaging biomarker of liver stiffness which is based on an analysis of shear waves induced in the liver by low-frequency vibrations applied to the abdominal wall.

In cross-sectional studies, MRE has demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for discriminating fibrosis stage and predicting clinical complications.14–17

However, the correlation between change in MRE-estimated liver stiffness with histologic response is unknown, and a clinically relevant threshold for MRE-estimated liver stiffness reduction for predicting an anti-fibrotic response has not been identified.

PARAGRAPH

Magnetic resonance imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) is a quantitative imaging biomarker of hepatic steatosis.

MRI-PDFF has been shown to be accurate compared to PDFF measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy in cross-sectional studies18,19 and to histologic steatosis grade determined from liver biopsy in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies,20,21 and has been used in drug treatment clinical trials to assess longitudinal changes in hepatic steatosis in patients with NASH.20,22,23

In a meta-analysis of 23 studies with 1,679 participants, MRI-PDFF was shown to have excellent linearity, bias, and precision across different reconstruction methods, and MR scanners of different field strength and manufacturer.24

A reduction of approximately 30% in MRI-PDFF has been associated with steatosis improvement.25

It is important to note that histologic assessment of hepatic steatosis estimates the number of steatotic cells in the liver, while MRI-PDFF estimates the overall percentage of MRI-visible protons on fat molecules in the liver.21

Since the fat content of a cell does not generally exceed 50%, MRI-PDFF percentages are almost always less than half the value derived by histology.

For example, if 100% of hepatocytes on hematoxylin and eosin stain were 50% filled with fat globules, the steatosis percentage would be 100% by histologic assessment, but only 50% by MRI-PDFF.

PARAGRAPH

We analyzed imaging, biopsy, and serum marker data from a phase IIb study of selonsertib, a selective inhibitor of apoptosis-signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), and simtuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2), in patients with NASH and stage 2 or 3 liver fibrosis.

The objectives of our analysis were to assess the performance of MRE-estimated liver stiffness and MRI-PDFF for the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with NASH; specifically, to evaluate the performance of MRE-estimated liver stiffness in predicting fibrosis response and of MRI-PDFF in predicting improvement of NASH in the context of a clinical trial.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Patients and study design

PARAGRAPH

The study design and procedures have been previously described.26

Briefly, patients 18 to 70 years of age were enrolled at 23 sites in the United States and Canada from June 8, 2015 to March 31, 2016.

To be eligible, patients were required to have a liver biopsy within 3 months of screening consistent with a diagnosis of NASH and stage 2 or stage 3 fibrosis according to the NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN) histologic scoring system.

All patients had a NAFLD activity score (NAS) of 5 or higher, with a score of at least 1 for each of the 3 components (steatosis, hepatocellular ballooning, and lobular inflammation).

All patients had at least 3 of the following features of the metabolic syndrome: abdominal obesity, hypertension, elevated fasting glucose, elevated levels of serum triglycerides, or low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

PARAGRAPH

Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:2:1:1:1 ratio to receive 24 weeks of treatment with 6 mg or 18 mg of selonsertib alone, 6 mg or 18 mg of selonsertib with 125 mg of simtuzumab, or 125 mg of simtuzumab alone.

Selonsertib was administered orally once daily and simtuzumab was administered as weekly subcutaneous injections.

As previously reported,26 after 24 weeks of treatment, the proportion of patients with at least a 1-stage reduction in fibrosis was 43% in the 18 mg selonsertib group (± simtuzumab), 30% in the 6 mg selonsertib group (± simtuzumab), and 20% in the simtuzumab-alone group.

Treatment groups were combined for this analysis.

SECTION

Assessments

SECTION

Liver histology

PARAGRAPH

Core liver biopsies were obtained at screening and at week 24.

Biopsies were read by a single central reader (ZG) blinded to treatment assignment, but not biopsy sequence.

Histological assessments included the adequacy of the biopsy specimen, confirmation of the diagnosis, morphometric quantification of hepatic collagen content and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression, fibrosis staged according to a modified Ishak classification and the NASH CRN classification, and grading of steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning according to the NAS.

PARAGRAPH

For morphometric quantification of hepatic collagen and fat, one biopsy section was stained with picrosirius red.

α-SMA (a marker of stellate cell and myofibroblast activation) was identified immunohistochemically (Ventana Benchmark Ultra autostainer using prediluted Dako Clone 1A4 and Ultraview Universal DAB detection kit).

For quantification of α-SMA expression, collagen and fat, a digital image of the entire stained section was acquired using an Aperio ScanScope XT (Leica Biosystems, Vista, CA, USA) at 20× magnification.

To quantify the fraction of positively stained pixels, the Aperio Positive Pixel Count algorithm was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions and as previously described with custom limits set to identify collagen as red pixels and fat as white pixels in the picrosirius red stain.

α-SMA was identified as brown pixels in the immunostain.

The results were expressed as the percentage of the entire biopsy section that was positive for the color of interest.

SECTION

Imaging assessments

PARAGRAPH

Imaging assessments were performed at baseline and weeks 12 and 24 by an experienced central reader (UCSD Radiology Reading Center) blinded to treatment assignments and clinical and histologic data.

All sites underwent a quality assessment process prior to study initiation based on a review of MR platforms, hardware and software, as well as phantom scans.

All research images acquired in the trial were approved by the central reader.

All scans for individual patients were performed under fasting conditions using an identical equipment set-up throughout the study.

A unique aspect of this trial was that scans could be performed using any of 3 MR platform (General Electric Medical Systems, Waukesha, WI; Philips, Eindhoven, Netherlands; Siemens, Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany), which was made possible by the process of data acquisition standardization by the centralized readers.

PARAGRAPH

Liver stiffness was estimated using a multi-breath-hold 2-dimensional MRE (60 Hz) gradient-echo motion-sensitized sequence.27

Vibrations at 60 Hz were transmitted into the liver by a passive driver centered at the right midclavicular line at the level of the xiphoid and secured by an elastic band.

Shear waves induced by these vibrations were visualized by a motion-sensitized phase-contrast sequence with gradient oscillations at 60 Hz (i.e., coupled to the frequency of the vibrations).

Four separate sets images were obtained, each set at a different slice of the liver and with 4 different phase offsets to capture different portions of the wave cycle.

These images were converted into an elastogram using an inversion algorithm, depicting pixel by pixel the estimated stiffness of abdominal tissues.

The central reader manually drew regions of interest (ROIs) on the elastograms in each of the 4 slices to include liver tissue where wave propagation was determined to be adequate based on visual inspection of the waves as well as objective goodness-of-fit criteria.

Weighted mean liver stiffness across all pixels contained within the ROIs was then recorded as the per-patient mean liver stiffness.

MRE scans were considered unanalyzable if the total number of pixels in the ROIs in the 4 slices was <700.

PARAGRAPH

Where available, liver stiffness was also estimated using vibration-controlled transient elastography (FibroScan, Echosens, Paris, France) at baseline and week 24 according to standardized protocol that included pre-procedure fasting.

Of the 56 FibroScan assessments performed, 19 (34%) were done with the M probe and 37 (66%) with the XL probe.

MRI-PDFF was used to assess hepatic steatosis using a validated magnitude multi-echo spoiled-gradient-echo pulse sequence.18–21

Data analysts at the UCSD Radiology Reading Center placed a circular 1 cm radius ROI on 5th echo (out-of-phase) images in each of the 9 anatomic liver segments; those ROIs were propagated to images for the other echoes; and a mean PDFF value for the entire liver was calculated as the average of evaluable PDFF values of the 9 segments.

SECTION

Serum markers of fibrosis and liver injury

PARAGRAPH

Changes from baseline in serum markers of fibrosis and liver injury were measured at weeks 12 and 24.

Serum markers included the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany),28 FibroTest (BioPredictive, Paris, France),29 and cytokeratin-18 (CK-18) M30 and M65 fractions (M30 Apoptosense ELISA and M65 EpiDeath ELISA; Diapharma, West Chester, OH).

Liver biochemistry including serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase were measured by commercial assays.

The NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) and Fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) were also calculated.

SECTION

Statistical analyses

PARAGRAPH

Associations between imaging results (MRI-PDFF and MRE-estimated liver stiffness) and other measures were determined using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Spearman correlations.

Our main analysis populations consisted of all patients with evaluable imaging and histologic assessments at both baseline and week 24.

Although imaging and serologic assessments were also performed at week 12, changes in these measures from baseline were not predictive of histologic responses.

PARAGRAPH

The discrimination of MRI-PDFF for NAS response (≥2-point reduction) and steatosis improvement (≥1-grade reduction), and of MRE-estimated liver stiffness for fibrosis improvement (≥1-stage reduction) and fibrosis progression (≥1-stage increase) were evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).

Optimal thresholds for predicting histological responses were determined based on the maximal sum of sensitivity and specificity.

Reductions in MRI-PDFF in this paper will be referred to as being relative or absolute; for example, a decrease in MRI-PDFF from 10% to 7.5% would constitute a 25% relative reduction, and a 2.5% absolute reduction of that parameter.

MRE

SECTION

Analysis population

PARAGRAPH

Of the 72 patients with biopsy-proven NASH and stage 2 or 3 fibrosis who were randomized and treated, 54 had evaluable MRE and biopsies at baseline and week 24 (Table 1).

Compared with the included patients, the 18 excluded patients had higher median body mass index and serum ALT and GGT at baseline (Table S1).

The median age of the 54 included patients was 56 years, 76% were women, and 69% had diabetes mellitus.

Approximately two-thirds of patients (63%) had F3 fibrosis.

Median liver stiffness by MRE at baseline was 3.6 kPa (IQR, 3.1 to 4.6), consistent with moderate to advanced fibrosis.

At baseline and week 24, the median (IQR) intervals between biopsy and MRE were 31 days (20, 89) and -1 day (−5.5, 0), respectively.

At baseline and week 24, the median (IQR) biopsy lengths were 2.3 cm (1.8, 2.7) and 2.2 cm (1.6, 2.7), respectively.

In total, 67% of all biopsies were ≥2.0 cm in length.

Biopsy lengths did not differ among fibrosis responders, non-responders, and the overall population (data not shown).

SECTION

Correlations between MRE and other measures of fibrosis at baseline and week 24

PARAGRAPH

At baseline, liver stiffness by MRE was significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (rs = 0.33, p = 0.007), liver stiffness by FibroScan (rs = 0.49, p < 0.001), hepatic α-SMA expression (rs = 0.29, p = 0.020), and ELF test (rs = 0.25, p = 0.045).

The correlation between liver stiffness by MRE and hepatic collagen content at baseline was not significant (rs = 0.19, p = 0.14).

At week 24, liver stiffness by MRE was significantly correlated with all measures of fibrosis: fibrosis stage (rs = 0.55; Fig. 1A), hepatic collagen content by morphometry (rs = 0.54), liver stiffness by FibroScan (rs = 0.62), hepatic α-SMA expression (rs = 0.47), and ELF score (rs = 0.44) (p ≤0.001 for all comparisons).

Median (IQR) liver stiffness values by MRE in patients with stage 1, 2, 3, and 4 fibrosis at week 24 were 2.9 (2.6, 3.3), 3.0 (2.8, 3.8), 4.7 (3.5, 5.2), and 5.5 kPa (4.8, 6.2), respectively (Fig. 1A).

For the discrimination of advanced fibrosis at week 24 (F1-F2 vs. F3-F4), the AUROC of liver stiffness by MRE was 0.80 (95% CI 0.68–0.92).

SECTION

Associations between liver stiffness by MRE and histologic responses

PARAGRAPH

Among 54 patients with evaluable MRE and biopsies at baseline and week 24, 18 (33%) had fibrosis improvement (≥1-stage reduction) and 8 (15%) had fibrosis progression (≥1-stage increase).

Among 55 patients with evaluable MRE and NAS scores at baseline and week 24, 10 (18%) had NAS response (≥2-point reduction).

Compared with non-responders, the median relative change in liver stiffness by MRE was larger in patients with fibrosis improvement (3.0% vs. -2.3%, p = 0.17) or NAS response (2.1% vs. −7.9%, p = 0.12), but these differences did not achieve statistical significance.

The AUROC of liver stiffness by MRE to predict NAS response was 0.66 (95% CI 0.48–0.83) and to predict fibrosis improvement was 0.62 (95% CI 0.46–0.78).

The AUROC for liver stiffness by MRE and other non-invasive markers including liver stiffness by transient elastography, ELF score, NFS, and FIB-4 were similar (Table S2).

The optimal threshold of liver stiffness by MRE to predict fibrosis improvement was any (≥0%) relative reduction (Fig. 1B and Table 2).

At this cut-off, MRE as a predictor of fibrosis improvement was 67% sensitive, 64% specific, and had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 48% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 79%.

The AUROC of MRE to predict fibrosis improvement was improved to 0.79 (95% CI 0.67–0.91) by combining baseline liver stiffness by MRE and its change over 24 weeks.

Compared with patients with no reduction in liver stiffness by MRE, those with any reduction had greater relative changes between baseline and week 24 in hepatic collagen content by morphometry (2.8% vs. −21.9%, p = 0.61), liver stiffness by FibroScan (−2.7% vs. –4.0%; p = 0.40), ELF score (0.5% vs. −1.7%; p = 0.030), PIII-NP (14.1% vs. −11.0%; p = 0.056), and TIMP-1 (5.7% vs. −9.0%; p = 0.016) (Fig. 3A).

Liver stiffness by MRE performed better for predicting fibrosis improvement in patients with F3 fibrosis at baseline (sensitivity, 69% [9/13]); specificity, 86% [18/21]) than in patients with F2 fibrosis at baseline (sensitivity, 60% [3/5]); specificity, 33% [5/15]).

PARAGRAPH

The AUROC of liver stiffness by MRE for detecting fibrosis progression was 0.57 (95% CI 0.36–0.79) and the optimal threshold was a ≥0% relative increase (Table 2).

At this cut-off, liver stiffness by MRE was 63% sensitive, 46% specific, and had a PPV of 17% and an NPV of 88% for predicting fibrosis progression.

MRI-PDFF

SECTION

Analysis population

PARAGRAPH

Of the 72 randomized patients, 65 had evaluable MRI-PDFF and biopsies at baseline and week 24 (Table 1).

Compared with the included patients, the 7 excluded patients had higher median body mass index at baseline (Table S3).

The median age of the 65 included patients was 56 years, and the majority were white (91%) and female (71%).

Approximately, two-thirds of patients (68%) had grade 1 steatosis.

At baseline, median hepatic fat content by morphometry was 17.8% (IQR, 10.0% to 21.3%) and median MRI-PDFF was 16.6% (IQR 10.9% to 22.0%).

The median (IQR) intervals between biopsy and MRI-PDFF were 29 days (20, 78) at baseline and -1 day (5.5, 0) at week 24.

SECTION

Correlations between MRI-PDFF, and hepatic fat content by morphometry, and NAS at baseline and week 24

PARAGRAPH

MRI-PDFF was significantly correlated with hepatic fat content by morphometry at baseline (rs = 0.61, p <0.001) and week 24 (rs = 0.87, p <0.001).

MRI-PDFF correlated with NAS steatosis grade at both baseline (rs = 0.57) and week 24 (rs = 0.59, both p <0.001; Fig. 2A).

The correlation between MRI-PDFF with the overall NAS was not significant at baseline (rs = 0.22, p = 0.069), but was highly significant at week 24 (rs = 0.44, p <0.001; Fig. 2).

Correlations with other components of the NAS were inconsistent: lobular inflammation (baseline: rs = −0.12, p = 0.34; week 24: rs = 0.28, p = 0.02) and hepatocellular ballooning (baseline: rs = −0.21, p = 0.08; week 24: rs = 0.14, p = 0.27).

Median (IQR) MRI-PDFF in patients with grade 0, 1, 2, and 3 steatosis at week 24 were 5.8% (5.2, 6.7), 14.5% (10.3, 19.2), 26.2% (18.2, 29.0), and 32.2% (26.0, 38.4), respectively (Fig. 2A).

For the discrimination of any histologic steatosis at week 24 (S0 vs. S1-S3), the AUROC of MRI-PDFF was 0.90 (95% CI 0.80–1.0).

SECTION

Association between changes in MRI-PDFF and histologic response

PARAGRAPH

Among 65 patients with evaluable MRI-PDFF and biopsies at baseline and week 24, 18 (28%) had improvement in steatosis (≥1-grade reduction) and 12 (18%) had a NAS response (≥2-point reduction).

For the prediction of steatosis improvement, the AUROC of MRI-PDFF was 0.70 (95% CI 57–83) and the optimal threshold was a ≥0% relative reduction.

At this threshold, MRI-PDFF was 89% sensitive, 47% specific, and had a PPV of 39% and NPV of 92%.

PARAGRAPH

The AUROC of MRI-PDFF to predict NAS response was 0.70 (95% CI 0.51–0.89) (Fig. 2B) and the optimal threshold was a ≥25% relative reduction between baseline and week 24.

At this cut-off, MRI-PDFF was 50% sensitive, 81% specific, and had a PPV of 38% and an NPV of 88% (Table 3).

Compared with patients with <25% relative reductions in MRI-PDFF, those with ≥25% relative reductions were more likely to have improved steatosis grades (22% vs. 44%; p = 0.12), larger relative changes in hepatic fat content by morphometry (−4.2% vs. −36.0%; p < 0.001), improved histologic lobular inflammation scores (16% vs. 50%; p = 0.016), and relative reductions in serum ALT (−2.9% vs. −31.8%; p = 0.001), CK18 M30 (4.9% vs. −30.7%; p = 0.008), ELF score (0.4% vs. −2.5%; p = 0.027), and TIMP-1 (1.7% vs. –7.8%; p = 0.084) (Fig. 3B and Table 3).

No statistically significant differences in hepatocyte ballooning or lobular portal inflammation were noted in patients with ≥25% relative reduction in MRI-PDFF.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The current gold standard to evaluate efficacy of therapeutic interventions in NASH is liver histology including assessments of steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis.

However, liver biopsies are associated with potentially serious complications including pain, bleeding, injury to other organs, and, rarely, death.

Due to these risks, many patients decline to participate in clinical trials, particularly those that require repeated biopsies.

The development of alternative, non-invasive methods for assessing these histological parameters is paramount to the future of NASH management and drug development.

PARAGRAPH

In this analysis of data from a multicenter phase II study of selonsertib in patients with NASH, magnetic resonance-based hepatic imaging results were significantly correlated with histological features assessed cross-sectionally and longitudinally.

Specifically, liver stiffness by MRE was significantly correlated with fibrosis as assessed by liver biopsy and non-invasive serum markers.

Correlations at baseline were generally weaker than those at week 24, likely due to the greater dynamic range of fibrosis observed at the end of the study – when histologic responses to selonsertib were observed – compared with the beginning when the range was narrow due to the enrolment criteria that included only patients with F2 to F3 fibrosis.

After 24 weeks of treatment, any reduction in liver stiffness by MRE was predictive of fibrosis stage improvement with an AUROC of 0.62 (95% CI 0.46–0.78), as well as for NAS score improvement with an AUROC of 0.66 (95% CI 0.48–0.83).

PARAGRAPH

The analysis also showed that MRI-PDFF was significantly correlated with histologic assessments of steatosis; specifically, NAS steatosis grade and hepatic fat content by morphometry.

In addition, any reduction in MRI-PDFF was predictive of steatosis improvement on liver biopsy with an AUROC of 0.70 (95% CI 0.57–0.83).

Reductions in MRI-PDFF were also correlated with reductions in markers of hepatic apoptosis and necroinflammation, including serum CK18, and improvements in the total NAS, suggesting that reductions in hepatic fat may be associated with reduced hepatic apoptosis and necrosis after treatment with selonsertib.

These findings support the utility of both non-invasive assessments, as endpoints for the longitudinal evaluation of efficacy in clinical trials of experimental treatments for NASH.

PARAGRAPH

These results are broadly in keeping with the findings of previous studies.

Cross-sectional studies have consistently shown a correlation between MRE and histologic fibrosis stage, while longitudinal studies are lacking.16,30

MRE has been shown to more accurately discriminate advanced fibrosis compared with earlier stages;30 our results support these findings.

MRI-PDFF has been repeatedly shown to correlate strongly with hepatic fat assessed histologically.

Moreover, reductions of MRI-PDFF of 25–30% have been associated with improvements in hepatic steatosis and the overall NAS.25

PARAGRAPH

Overall, the ability of changes in MRE alone to discriminate improvements in liver fibrosis was sub-optimal as evidenced by an AUROC of 0.62.

The repeatability coefficient of liver stiffness measurement by MRE in a recent meta-analysis31 was 22% (95% CI 16.1–28.2%) which exceeds our optimal cut-off (≥0% relative reduction) to predict fibrosis improvement.

When a higher threshold of MRE reduction of ≥25%, exceeding the intrinsic variation of MRE, was applied to our data, the sensitivity of MRE was reduced to 11%, while specificity increased to 92%.

It is possible that reproducibility in a highly-controlled clinical trial such as this one, where care was taken to standardize protocols and to ensure ongoing quality assurance, was better than that reported in that meta-analysis.

For future studies, the threshold of MRE reduction deemed clinically relevant could be optimized to maximize sensitivity or specificity as appropriate.

For example, in early development a more sensitive threshold could be selected in order to avoid prematurely discontinuing development of a potential anti-fibrotic drug, while a more specific threshold would be more appropriate as a potentially approvable endpoint.

Importantly, we observed that combining baseline and change in liver stiffness by MRE improved the AUROC to discriminate fibrosis stage improvement to 0.79.

This is consistent with the finding that liver stiffness by MRE performed better for predicting fibrosis improvement in patients with F3 fibrosis at baseline (vs. F2) and suggests that MRE may be a more accurate tool in patients with more advanced fibrosis.

PARAGRAPH

Strengths of the current study include the rigorous collection of imaging data from a multicenter, international cohort.

Our study demonstrates the feasibility and reproducibility of imaging results from large number of diverse centers.

While other studies have evaluated the relationship between changes in MRI-PDFF and liver histology, this is the first NASH interventional trial to also include longitudinal measurements of liver stiffness by MRE.

In addition, liver pathology was interpreted centrally by a single reader and all imaging results were read centrally after being obtained from scanners that went through a rigorous qualification process during study initiation.

Our study also has limitations including the relatively small sample size, its population limited to patients with F2 and F3 fibrosis at baseline, and the lack of biopsy and imaging data for every enrolled patient at every time point.

The interpretation of our results is also limited by the lack of a control group and the intrinsic variability of the MRE.27

The study was also relatively short, with a 24-week endpoint and these factors likely explain why, in general, the sensitivities and specificities are lower than those previously reported.

In light of these limitations, caution is necessary to avoid over interpretation until these findings can be validated.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, these preliminary results provide further confirmation of the feasibility of obtaining MRE and MRI-PDFF in multicenter trials, and strengthen evidence that liver stiffness by MRE and MRI-PDFF are biomarkers of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis, respectively.

Moreover, the data confirm that changes in MRI-PDFF are associated with changes in hepatic steatosis and overall NAS score response.

For the first time, evidence of the ability of MRE to discriminate longitudinal changes in fibrosis in response to treatment – specifically, 24 weeks of selonsertib therapy – was demonstrated.

Additional studies with larger populations and longer follow-up are required to confirm the linkage of liver stiffness by MRE to clinical outcomes.
