TITLE

The conundrum of cryptogenic cirrhosis: Adverse outcomes without treatment options

PARAGRAPH

Significant liver damage and cirrhosis of the liver may develop without a known cause â€“ a liver disease referred to as cryptogenic cirrhosis.

In this work we found that, in the presence of metabolic abnormalities, cryptogenic cirrhosis may actually be a part of the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease spectrum.

Yet, it appears to be more progressive than typical non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, leading to advanced liver disease at a faster rate.
