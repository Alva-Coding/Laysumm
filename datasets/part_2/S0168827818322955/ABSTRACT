ABSTRACT

TITLE

The conundrum of cryptogenic cirrhosis: Adverse outcomes without treatment options

PARAGRAPH

Although patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis have historically been considered as having “burnt-out” non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), some controversy remains.

The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis and NASH-related cirrhosis from a cohort with longitudinal follow-up data.

PARAGRAPH

Patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis or NASH cirrhosis were screened for a clinical trial.

Patients with <5% hepatic steatosis regardless of other histologic features were considered to have cryptogenic cirrhosis.

Clinico-laboratory data and adjudicated liver-related events (e.g. decompensation, qualification for transplantation, death) were available.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 247 patients with cirrhosis (55.3 ± 7.4 years, 37% male) were included; 144 had NASH cirrhosis and 103 had cryptogenic cirrhosis.

During a median follow-up of 29 (IQR 21–33) months (max 45 months), 20.6% of patients had liver-related clinical events.

Patients with NASH cirrhosis and cryptogenic cirrhosis were of a similar age and gender, as well as having a similar body mass index, PNPLA3 rs738409 genotype, and prevalence of diabetes (p >0.05).

However, patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis had higher serum fibrosis markers and greater collagen content and α-smooth muscle actin expression on liver biopsy.

Compared to cirrhotic patients with NASH, patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis experienced significantly shorter mean time to liver-related clinical events (12.0 vs. 19.4 months; p = 0.001) with a hazard ratio of 1.76 (95% CI 1.02–3.06).

PARAGRAPH

Populations with NASH and cryptogenic cirrhosis have similar demographics, but patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis have evidence of more active fibrosis and a higher risk of liver-related clinical events.

Thus, we believe these patients belong to the same spectrum of disease, with cryptogenic cirrhosis representing a more advanced stage of fibrosis.
