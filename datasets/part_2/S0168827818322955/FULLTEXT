TITLE

The conundrum of cryptogenic cirrhosis: Adverse outcomes without treatment options

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is not only a very common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, but also is a subtype of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that can potentially progress to cirrhosis and its complications.1

A number of studies have shown that approximately one-third of patients with NAFLD can develop progressive liver disease, while 20% develop cirrhosis and are at increased risk of mortality.1,2

PARAGRAPH

In addition to patients with NAFLD and NASH, another clinically similar group of patients with metabolic complications present with cirrhosis without significant hepatic steatosis (<5%) on liver biopsy and with no other recognized causes of chronic liver disease.

Historically, these patients have been designated as having cryptogenic cirrhosis.3–5

Despite some recent controversy, most patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis in the USA have been considered as having “burnt-out” NASH.3–7

This concept was indirectly supported by the fact that patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis who receive a liver transplant had higher rates of obesity and other metabolic factors and a higher risk of developing recurrence of NASH and metabolic conditions after transplantation.4,5

In fact, most of existing evidence regarding cryptogenic cirrhosis originates from transplant registries or retrospective analyses while there is paucity of data to directly compare patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis to patients with histologically-proven NASH.4–7

Therefore, the aim of this study is to use a large cohort of patients with biopsy-proven NASH and cryptogenic cirrhosis to compare their baseline clinical characteristics and laboratory data as well as their outcomes during prospective follow-up.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Data source

PARAGRAPH

This analysis used data from a large, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase IIb study of simtuzumab in patients with compensated cirrhosis (NCT01672879) due to NASH.

A pre-planned interim analysis conducted after all patients had completed 96 weeks of treatment found that there were no meaningful differences between either of the simtuzumab groups or the placebo group in any efficacy endpoint.

The primary results of these studies are reported elsewhere, where the methods are fully described.8

Briefly, enrolled patients were aged 18–65 years with stage 5 or 6 fibrosis by modified Ishak classification on a liver biopsy which was consistent with NASH or cryptogenic cirrhosis, without any other cause of chronic liver disease (viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease).

Patients with any history of hepatic decompensation, including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or variceal hemorrhage; endoscopic variceal ligation; weight-reduction surgery in the prior five years; infection with either the hepatitis B or C virus; alcohol consumption >21 oz/week for men or >14 oz/week for women; or clinically significant comorbidities were excluded.

In addition, patients were excluded if they had a Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) score >7 or a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score >12.

SECTION

Liver histology

PARAGRAPH

Liver biopsies collected at screening and at weeks 48 and 96 were read by a single pathologist (Z.G.).

The biopsy specimens were scored using modified Ishak classification,1 the NASH Clinical Research Network classification,9 and the NAFLD activity score, which includes separate scores for steatosis (0-3), hepatocellular ballooning (0-2), and lobular inflammation (0-3).9

Patients were presumed to have cryptogenic cirrhosis if they had <5% steatosis; the remaining patients with ≥5% steatosis regardless of other histologic features were categorized as having NASH.

PARAGRAPH

In addition, hepatic collagen content was quantified using morphometric analysis of one biopsy section stained with picrosirius red.

α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), a marker of stellate cell and myofibroblast activation, was identified immunohistochemically (Ventana Benchmark Ultra autostainer using prediluted Dako Clone 1A4 and Ultraview Universal DAB detection kit).

For quantification of α-SMA expression and collagen, a digital image of the entire stained section was acquired using an Aperio ScanScope XT (Leica Biosystems, Vista, CA, USA) at 20x magnification.

To quantify the fraction of positively stained pixels, the Aperio Positive Pixel Count algorithm was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions and as previously described.

The results were expressed as the percentage of the entire biopsy section that was positive for the color of interest.

SECTION

Study outcomes

PARAGRAPH

The primary outcome was the occurrence of liver-related events including indicators of hepatic decompensation (ascites, newly diagnosed varices in a patient without prior varices, esophageal variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, or ≥2-point increase in CPT score), liver transplantation, MELD ≥15, and death.

Only events during the trial period were included.

The trial was stopped once all patients had reached week 96, but many patients had more follow-up than 96 weeks because of the enrollment period.

Time to first event was calculated from the date of enrollment.

SECTION

Statistical analyses

PARAGRAPH

Demographic and clinical parameters were summarized as mean ± standard deviation or n (%) and were compared between patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis and NASH cirrhosis using chi-square test or Mann-Whitney test.

Kaplan-Meier survival models were used to assess the association of liver disease etiology (cryptogenic vs. NASH) with the time to first liver-related clinical event, and Cox proportional hazards model were used to account for potentially confounding demographic and clinical factors.

Patients without clinical events during follow-up were censored at last follow-up or discontinuation of the study.

PARAGRAPH

All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

All participants signed an informed consent, and the study was approved by each site’s Institutional Review Board.

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

We included 247 patients with cirrhosis; 103 had cryptogenic cirrhosis and 144 had biopsy-proven NASH with cirrhosis.

Patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis were demographically similar to those with NASH cirrhosis (all p >0.05) except they were less likely to be white (p = 0.01).

Cryptogenic cirrhosis patients also had similar body mass index (BMI), a similar prevalence of type 2 diabetes and PNPLA3 rs738409 genotypes, and similar levels of fasting glucose (p >0.05), although lower insulin, homeostatic model assessment score and glycated hemoglobin levels (p <0.05) (Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

Compared to patients with NASH, patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis had lower mean aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels, although higher bilirubin and international normalized ratio (INR) and lower albumin and platelet count (all p ≤0.05).

Furthermore, patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis also had less lobular inflammation and less hepatocyte ballooning (both p <0.001).

In addition, compared to patients with NASH cirrhosis, those with cryptogenic cirrhosis had higher non-invasive fibrosis scores such as FIB-4, Fibrotest, and NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) (p <0.05).

Morphometric assessment showed that patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis had higher% collagen deposition and higher% α-SMA (p <0.05).

Finally, patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis were more likely to have a history of esophageal varices at baseline, as well as lower platelet count and higher MELD scores (Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

In subsequent liver biopsies (weeks 48 and 96), the changes in patients’ histologic parameters were not statistically significant (all p >0.05).

Despite this, out of patients with baseline NASH (steatosis ≥5%), 11/127 (8.7%) no longer met that threshold later in follow-up; the mean baseline fat content in those patients was 7.3 ± 4.5%.

In contrast, out of patients with baseline cryptogenic cirrhosis (steatosis <5%), 38/94 (40.4%) had ≥5% of fat on their subsequent biopsy: mean 9.0 ± 4.8%.

PARAGRAPH

During a median (IQR) follow-up of 29 (21–33) months (min 1 month, max 45 months), patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis tended to have a higher rate of liver-related clinical events (p = 0.068) and had a significantly shorter time to event (p = 0.0011) in comparison to patients with NASH-related cirrhosis (Table 2).

In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, having cryptogenic cirrhosis rather than NASH was associated with an increased risk of liver-related clinical events (hazard ratio 1.76; 95% CI 1.02–3.06; p = 0.043) (Fig. 1).

This association remained significant after adjustment for age, gender, race, location (USA vs. non-USA), BMI and history of diabetes (p = 0.03), but was no longer significant after addition of MELD score into the model (p = 0.12) (Table 3).

No association between the use of hypoglycemic or lipid lowering medications and outcome was found (all p >0.18).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

This is the first study comparing patients with biopsy-proven cirrhosis with and without significant steatosis on liver biopsy.

Clinically, patients with so called “cryptogenic cirrhosis”, i.e. cirrhosis with less than 5% of steatosis, and NASH have a similar prevalence of components of metabolic syndrome.

This is consistent with the hypothesis that both of these conditions belong to the same spectrum of liver disease associated with metabolic syndrome.10,11

In this context, patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis had lower aminotransferases and less histologic activity as demonstrated by less hepatocyte ballooning and lobular inflammation.

In contrast, these patients had higher collagen content and α-SMA expression by computer-assisted morphometry.

This, in turn, suggests that the pathogenesis of cryptogenic cirrhosis may primarily be promoted by a more intense fibrogenic rather than inflammatory process although both are being driven in the context of metabolic abnormalities.

Indeed, despite lower levels of aminotransferases and less lobular inflammation, the outcomes of patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis were worse than those of patients with NASH-related cirrhosis.

In addition, patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis had more esophageal varices, lower platelets, higher non-invasive fibrosis scores, MELD score, INR, and total bilirubin, all indicating more hepatic dysfunction accompanied by the presence of portal hypertension.

This might also indicate that these patients are probably not identified clinically by their abnormal liver enzymes and are more likely to present with more advanced liver disease.

Interestingly, the Ishak stage distributions (proportions of stages 5 and 6) were similar (p = 0.17) between the groups despite differences in hepatic collagen content on liver biopsy, suggesting lower sensitivity of this fibrosis scoring scheme than morphometric quantification of collagen.

PARAGRAPH

These data highlight the clinical conundrum of patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis.

Despite evidence that these patients have similar metabolic and clinical features, more histologic collagen deposition and worse clinical outcomes, patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis are routinely excluded from clinical trials of NASH because of the requirement for significant steatosis and ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes on patients’ liver biopsies.12–14

This is probably because of regulatory bodies insisting on resolution of NASH being an outcome, and the unjustified threshold of steatosis (>5%) being an inclusion criterion for clinical trials.

However, we believe that patients with so called “cryptogenic cirrhosis” are a part of the same spectrum of NASH cirrhosis at different stages of the disease.

It is also important to note that previous studies have suggested that substantial de novo lipogenesis is still present in patients with cirrhosis.13–15

Of patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis included in our study (with less than 5% fat at baseline biopsy) who had another biopsy during follow-up, 40.4% had >5% fat on their subsequent biopsy, and, therefore, were no longer “cryptogenic”.

These data clearly indicate the lack of clear logic to require >5% histologic steatosis to define NASH and to exclude these patients as having a different category of liver disease.

PARAGRAPH

Given the data, one could argue that advanced liver disease in the context of metabolic abnormalities likely originate from the same underlying pathogenic process; that is, regardless of its histologic features.

Therefore, we propose that in the setting of risk factors for metabolic syndrome and the absence of other liver diseases, the terminology of cryptogenic cirrhosis should be abandoned, and patients with significant fibrosis or cirrhosis should be targeted similarly in the future studies of drugs.

In fact, the heightened fibrogenic process in cryptogenic cirrhosis suggest that such patients may benefit even more from an effective anti-fibrotic treatment strategy.

It may also be more appropriate to term this spectrum of disease, the liver disease of metabolic syndrome, or metabolic syndrome liver disease, rather than NASH for which the diagnosis is predicated on the presence of >5% histologic steatosis with hepatocyte ballooning.1,14

It is also important to remember that neither steatosis nor steatohepatitis have ever been shown to independently predict long-term outcomes in NAFLD.

In fact, the long-term outcomes seem to be exclusively predicted by the stage of fibrosis and by the presence of components of metabolic syndrome,1,2,9–11,16,17,19 neither of which are directly captured in the current nomenclature, which is primarily based on the histologic features of steatosis and ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes.

Given that, we propose that the current approach to patient selection is revisited, and unjustified soft outcomes mentioned above are replaced by those based on consistent evidence.

PARAGRAPH

In the context of this study, it is important to refer to a recent discussion regarding NASH and cryptogenic cirrhosis.6,20,21

The initial study compared clinical parameters and outcomes of patients listed for liver transplantation in the USA with the two listing diagnoses, and suggested that, given clear difference, NASH and cryptogenic cirrhosis should not be equated.6

In contrast, another recent study which used the same database suggested that although the two groups were not identical, patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis were clinically closer to NASH than the rest of the liver transplant population, therefore, indicating the presence of a substantial proportion of NASH in the mix of cryptogenic cirrhosis.7

Our data support this notion that although it is likely that not all patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis have “burnt-out NASH”, most patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis included in this analysis have clinical and metabolic features consistent with NASH.

In fact, the presence and absence of histologic steatosis in subsequent liver biopsies among patients with NASH and cryptogenic cirrhosis clearly indicate the lack of reliability of this histologic feature that separates NASH from cryptogenic cirrhosis.

Nevertheless, it is important that future studies address this issue and quantify the extent of overlap between NASH and other liver diseases that may be the cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis.

PARAGRAPH

Limitations of the study include a relatively short follow-up and a clinical trial setting which might have resulted in a biased sample of patients.

PARAGRAPH

In summary, data from this large study suggest that patients with NASH cirrhosis and with cryptogenic cirrhosis are different parts of the same spectrum of chronic liver disease that originates in the setting of metabolic abnormalities.

Furthermore, patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis seem to have a more aggressive disease, as indicated by greater hepatic collagen content and α-SMA expression on biopsy, higher serum fibrosis markers and MELD scores, and a greater risk of liver-related clinical events during follow-up.

As clinical trials for NASH are being developed, these patients with similar or even worse prognosis may be unnecessarily excluded and, thus, are left without potentially beneficial treatment options.17–19
