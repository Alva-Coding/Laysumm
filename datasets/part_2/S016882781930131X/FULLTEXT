TITLE

OX40 stimulation and PD-L1 blockade synergistically augment HBV-specific CD4 T cells in patients with HBeAg-negative infection

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Persistent infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major risk factor for the development of chronic liver injury, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and affects an estimated 350 million people worldwide.1

While there is a prophylactic vaccination to prevent chronic infection, therapeutic approaches for persistent infection are limited and mostly fail to eliminate the virus.2

Promising therapeutic approaches include T cell-based immunotherapy as both HBV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells have been shown to be required for viral clearance but are functionally impaired in the context of chronic infection.3–5

PARAGRAPH

Blockade of the inhibitory programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway has been shown to significantly enhance T cell responses in various settings and has already been implemented in clinical practice in the treatment of various solid cancers.6

However, data from clinical trials in patients with both hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic HBV infection suggest that PD-1 blockade alone is insufficient to improve viral control as none of the included patients achieved HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seroconversion during the course of therapy.7

Therefore, additional approaches are required to improve T cell responses in chronic HBV infection.

The co-stimulatory molecule OX40 (CD134) could be one such approach as it has also been shown to serve as a target for immunotherapeutic approaches.8

In a recent phase I trial in late stage cancer patients, it has safely been administered with remarkable effects on tumor burden in some patients.9

Moreover, OX40 signaling has been shown to facilitate immunological control against a variety of viruses, including HBV.10–12

Similarly, it has been shown that IL-7 can substantially improve the antiviral CD4 T cell response in a mouse model of persistent viral infection.13

Thus, targeting PD-1, OX40 or the IL-7 axis might improve the functionality of HBV-specific CD4 T cells.

PARAGRAPH

Studies of HBV-specific CD4 T cell responses in humans chronically infected with the virus have been hampered by the small frequency of circulating HBV-specific CD4 T cells.

Consequently, very few studies were able to shed light on the ex vivo phenotype of HBV-specific CD4 T cells, their transcriptional activity or their functional properties.

While high levels of PD-1 expression on HBV-specific CD4 T cells have been reported, PD-1 blockade did not significantly resuscitate IFN-γ secretion in these cells.14

Although increasing IFN-γ secretion is important, functional recovery of IL-21 producing HBV-specific CD4 T cells might be similarly relevant as IL-21 has been shown to be centrally involved in successful viral immunity.

Indeed, IL-21 has been implicated in the clearance of HBV infection in humans and in a humanized mouse model of HBV infection.15

In addition, IL-21 facilitates antiviral CD8 T cell immunity which is required for immune control of persistent lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice.16–18

Thus, IL-21 is a central player in antiviral immunity and should be utilized to improve HBV-specific CD4 T cells.

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to analyze whether blockade of PD-1 signaling, ligation of OX40 or addition of recombinant IL-7 would be feasible approaches to improve the functionality of HBV-specific CD4 T cell responses.

PARAGRAPH

This study was approved by the ethics committee (344/13 and 227/15_161217) of the University Hospital Freiburg.

Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals recruited in this study.

PARAGRAPH

Peripheral blood samples were obtained from a total of 127 patients chronically infected with HBV (cHBV) (66 patients with cHBV for overlapping peptide [OLP] screening, 32 patients with cHBV for HBV core tetramer screening and a further 29 patients cHBV were only used for control responses) and 71 healthy donors (HDs).

Detailed characteristics of study participants are provided in Tables S1 and S2.

Chronic HBV infection was defined as seropositivity for HBsAg and anti-HBV core for at least 6 months.

Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus coinfection were excluded.

Human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-typing was performed by next generation sequencing using commercially available primers (GenDx, Utrecht, The Netherlands) and run on a MiSeq system.

Data were analyzed using the NGSengine® Software (GenDx).

SECTION

Magnetic-bead-based enrichment of antigen-specific CD4 T cells

PARAGRAPH

Phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-tetramers of HLA-DRB1* 0101 HBV-derived epitope Core60-75 PE (aa-sequence: LCWGELMTLATWVGVN) and influenza (Flu)-derived epitope HA306-318 PE (aa-sequence: PKYVKQNTLKLAT) were obtained from MBL, Woburn, United States.

The tetramer enrichment protocol was performed as described for antigen-specific CD8 T cells by Alanio et al.19 Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HLA-DRB1* 0101-positive donors were incubated with the respective tetramer.

According to the manufacturer’s protocol, enrichment was performed using anti-PE MACS technology (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany).

Enriched antigen-specific CD4 T cells were detected by flow cytometry.

Naïve CD45RA+CCR7+CD4 T cells and samples with less than 5 antigen-specific CD4 T cells (considered below limit of detection) were excluded from the final analysis.

Enriched virus-specific CD4 T cells were calculated as follows: Absolute number of virus-specific CD4 T cells (enriched sample) divided by the absolute number of CD4 T cells (pre-enriched sample) times 100.

SECTION

High expression levels of PD-1, OX40 and CD127 on HBV-specific CD4 T cells

PARAGRAPH

The ex vivo phenotype of HBV-specific CD4 T cells is not well defined.

While some information is available on the hierarchy of inhibitory receptor expression,14 much less is known about the expression levels of stimulatory receptors that could be utilized therapeutically.

Thus, in order to determine the expression levels of several potential therapeutic targets on HBV-specific CD4 T cells directly ex vivo, we used MHC class II tetramer-technology with an HBV core protein derived epitope (HLA-DRB1*0101-restricted HBV core 61–80, aa-sequence: CWGELMTLATWVGVNLEDPA).

Bead-based enrichment was performed on all samples as has been described previously for HCV-specific CD4 T cells.21

This approach was also used to identify Flu-specific CD4 T cells (HLA-DRB1*0101-restricted Flu hemagglutinin 307–319, aa-sequence: PKYVKQNTLKLAT).

HBV-specific CD4 T cells were detected in 14 out of 32 (44%) HLA-DRB1*0101-positive patients with cHBV, and Flu-specific CD4 T cells were detected in 11 out of 12 (92%) HDs.

Both populations, however, were present at comparably low frequencies (Fig. 1A).

For phenotypic analyses of inhibitory and activation markers, antigen-specific CD4 T cells were compared to non-naïve bulk CD4 T cells as these markers are typically not expressed on naïve cells.

Thus, inclusion of naïve cells would artificially enhance the observed differences between HBV-specific CD4 T cells and bulk CD4 T cells.

In agreement with observations from Raziorrouh et al.,14 the inhibitory marker PD-1 and the IL-7 receptor α-chain (CD127) were strongly expressed on HBV-specific CD4 cells (Fig. 1B,C).

Compared to HBV-specific CD4 T cells, Flu-specific CD4 T cells expressed less PD-1 and higher levels of CD127 suggesting a less exhausted and more memory-like differentiation status (Fig. 1B,C).

Analyses of activation markers and co-stimulatory receptors (Fig. 1D,H) revealed high expression levels of OX40 (CD137, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 4, TNFRSF4) on HBV-specific CD4 T cells and to a lesser extent also on Flu-specific CD4 T cells (Fig. 1D).

In contrast, CD38 (Fig. 1E), 4-1BB (CD137) (Fig. 1F), ICOS (Fig. 1G) and CD40 ligand (CD154) (Fig. 1H) were scarcely expressed on HBV- and Flu-specific CD4 T cells directly ex vivo.

As OX40 and PD-1 both constitute promising targets for immune-therapeutic interventions, we analyzed co-expression of both receptors on virus-specific CD4 T cells.

Interestingly, the large majority of HBV-specific CD4 T cells co-express both receptors, while co-expression levels on Flu-specific CD4 T cells were significantly lower (Fig. 1I).

SECTION

Analysis of HBV-specific CD4 T cell responses in a large cohort of chronically infected individuals

PARAGRAPH

Previous studies analyzing HBV-specific T cells have provided conflicting results with regards to the viral proteins being targeted by CD4 T cells.

Indeed, it has been demonstrated that CD4 T cell responses are largely restricted to the core and polymerase proteins22,23 while another study suggested reactivity also towards the surface protein.24

Thus, in order to identify HBV-specific CD4 T cell responses in individual patients and to analyze the breadth of the HBV-specific CD4 T cell response, we performed in vitro stimulation assays using OLPs spanning the entire HBV proteome.

OLP stimulation was performed in 66 HBeAg-negative patients chronically infected with HBV genotype D (Table S1).

Stimulation and culture were performed as described in the methods section.

Readout was performed using ELISpot as well as intracellular cytokine staining to confirm each individual ELISpot response.

Of note, OLP stimulation was also performed in 11 HDs in order to determine HBV-unspecific background.

Importantly, 6 of 11 HDs (55%) mounted responses against 2 regions within the polymerase protein (i.e. OLP #16, 17, 105 and 106).

Therefore, these OLPs were excluded from the following analyses in HBV-infected patients.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 48 of 66 patients (73%) did not mount detectable HBV-specific CD4 T cell responses and 8 (12%), 7 (11%) and 3 (4%) patients mounted responses against 1, 2 or 3 HBV OLPs, respectively (Fig. 2A).

Interestingly, HBV-specific CD4 T cell responses were only detectable in patients with low to moderate viral titers up to 15,000 IU/ml.

Indeed, patients with higher viral loads (>20,000 IU/ml) did not mount HBV-specific CD4 T cell responses (Fig. 2B).

In our cohort, the presence of detectable CD4 responses was unrelated to treatment status (Fig. 2B, patients undergoing antiviral therapy displayed as red symbols).

In agreement with previous reports,22,23,25 we detected the majority of responses directed against the core and polymerase proteins.

Few responses targeted the X protein and no HBs-specific CD4 T cell responses were detected (Fig. 2C).

HBV-specific CD4 T cell responses were generally of low frequency and frequencies were comparable between responses targeting different viral proteins (Fig. 2D).

Frequencies of HBV-specific CD4 T cell responses were independent of viral loads and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in our cohort (Fig. S2C).

SECTION

Combined OX40 stimulation and PD-L1 blockade enhances the expansion of cytokine-producing HBV-specific CD4 T cells

PARAGRAPH

Next, we aimed to determine whether HBV-specific CD4 T cells in chronic HBV infection can be functionally augmented by either blockade of PD-L1 (α-PD-L1), stimulation of OX40 (α-OX40) or addition of recombinant IL-7 as these approaches have been shown to improve antiviral T cell responses in mouse models of viral infection and vaccine studies.11,13,26

Moreover, we performed blockade of PD-L1 in combination with OX40 stimulation in order to analyze whether both interventions could synergistically enhance HBV-specific CD4 T cell responses.

We stimulated PBMCs from chronically infected patients with OLPs identified in Fig. 2D (selected patients for stimulation experiments displayed as white symbols).

As shown in Fig. 3, stimulation with IL-7, α-OX40 or α-PD-L1 alone did not increase the percentage of IFN-γ secreting CD4 T cells after in vitro culture with HBV-specific epitopes.

Interestingly however, combination of α-OX40 and α-PD-L1 resulted in a significant increase of cytokine-producing CD4 T cells.

Importantly, this effect was observed for secretion of IFN-γ as well as IL-21 (Fig. 3A,D).

We also observed a tendency towards stronger IL-2 production; however, this effect did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 3C,D).

As these observations were made following in vitro culture, we aimed to assess whether combined α-OX40 and α-PD-L1 treatment was also able to unmask HBV-specific CD4 T cell responses directly ex vivo.

Therefore, we performed overnight stimulations in patients with a confirmed OLP-response in the presence or absence of α-OX40 and α-PD-L1.

This approach, however, was unable to boost HBV-specific CD4 T cell responses after overnight-culture (Fig. S4).

Collectively, these data indicate that HBV-specific CD4 T cells are sensitive to immune-therapeutic interventions and that combined targeting of the PD-1 and OX40 pathways significantly increases the percentage of IL-21 and IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells.

SECTION

CD4 T cells targeting Flu-, EBV- and TT-epitopes are sensitive to combined OX40 stimulation and PD-L1 blockade

PARAGRAPH

In order to analyze whether the observed effects are specific for HBV-specific CD4 T cells, we performed control experiments with CD4 T cell epitopes targeting different antigens in patients with cHBV and HDs.

We screened 49 patients with cHBV and 59 HDs for CD4 T cell responses against previously described epitopes derived from EBV, Flu and TT (Tables S1, S2 and S3).

Patients and donors with the strongest detectable responses were cultured in the presence or absence of α-OX40 and α-PD-L1 (Fig. 4).

Of note, baseline frequencies (peptide only) were slightly higher in HD compared to cHBV which is likely a selection bias, as more HDs were screened and some low frequency responses were not included in the stimulation assays.

However, as shown in Fig. 4, T cell responses against viral epitopes and TT epitopes showed comparable patterns of augmentation after combined OX40 stimulation and PD-L1 blockade, independent of the frequency of antigen-specific CD4 T cells in the absence of α-OX40 and α-PD-L1.

These observations indicate that immune interventions involving PD-L1 blockade and OX40 stimulation are not only effective in augmenting HBV-specific CD4 T cells but can also enhance CD4 T cells with various other specificities.

SECTION

Transcription factors T-bet and Bcl6 are strongly expressed on cytokine-secreting HBV-specific CD4 T cells

PARAGRAPH

IL-21 and IFN-γ are the signature cytokines of follicular T helper (Tfh) cells and T helper type 1 (Th1) cells, respectively.

In mouse models of viral infection, it has been shown that virus-specific CD4 T cells acquire either a Th1 or Tfh phenotype.27,28

Thus, we aimed to analyze whether HBV-specific CD4 T cells preferentially display a Tfh or Th1 phenotype.

Co-expression of the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5) and PD-1 was used to identify CD4 T cells with a Tfh phenotype while expression of the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 3 (CXCR3) in the absence of C-C chemokine receptor type 6 (CCR6) expression was used to identify Th1 cells.

Interestingly, we observed that the Tfh and Th1 distribution within HBV-specific CD4 T cells was very heterogeneous in patients with cHBV, with Tfh frequencies ranging from 12.5% to 91.3% (median 40%) and Th1 frequencies ranging from 15.8% to 69.6% (median 35.1%).

Importantly however, there was a significant overlap of cells with a Th1 phenotype and a Tfh phenotype, suggesting a lack of a clear Th1 vs. Tfh distribution within HBV-specific CD4 T cells (Fig. 5A,B).

As the Th1 signature cytokine IFN-γ was the most prominent cytokine produced by HBV-specific CD4 T cells after in vitro culture (Fig. 3), we aimed to analyze whether in vitro culture preferentially gives rise to cells with functional and transcriptional Th1 properties.

Therefore, we analyzed whether IL-21 and IFN-γ were produced by different cells following HBV-specific in vitro culture in the presence of α-OX40 and α-PD-L1.

Interestingly, we observed that IL-21 was almost exclusively secreted by IFN-γ co-expressing cells (Fig. 5C), On the transcriptional level, T-bet facilitates Th1 differentiation and IFN-γ secretion while Bcl6 functions as the transcriptional regulator for Tfh differentiation,29,30 under certain circumstances even repressing IFN-γ secretion.31

Therefore, we analyzed whether expression of these transcription factors mirrored the cytokine expression patterns in HBV-specific CD4 T cells.

Interestingly, we observed that expression levels of T-bet and Bcl6 were upregulated in HBV-specific cells producing either IFN-γ alone (IFN-γ+IL-21-) or both IFN-γ and IL-21 (IFN-γ+IL-21+) (Fig. 5D,E).

These observations further support the notion that HBV-specific CD4 T cells display a lack of a specific lineage commitment towards Th1 or Tfh differentiation.

As it has been suggested that T-bet expression is required for T cells to improve their effector functions following checkpoint blockade,32 we sought to analyze whether the expression levels of T-bet impacted the augmentation of HBV-specific CD4 T cells after combined PD-L1 blockade and OX40 stimulation.

Interestingly, the expression of T-bet in IFN-γ+IL-21- CD4 T cells following HBV-specific culture in the presence of α-OX40 and α-PD-L1 correlated with an increase of IFN-γ producing T cells under these conditions compared to peptide stimulation alone (Fig. 5D).

In contrast, Bcl6 expression tended to be negatively associated with the fold change of IFN-γ+IL-21- CD4 T cells following combined PD-L1 blockade and OX40 stimulation, although this association did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 5E).

In sum, our observations show that cytokine-producing HBV-specific CD4 T cells cannot be separated into Th1 and Tfh subsets based on their transcription factor expression and their cytokine secretion pattern after in vitro culture in the presence of α-OX40 and α-PD-L1.

However, the level of T-bet expression in HBV-specific CD4 T cells correlated with the responsiveness to combined PD-L1 blockade and OX40 stimulation with regards to IFN-γ secretion.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

It is widely accepted that HBV-specific T cells are crucially required to eliminate HBV infection.33

Indeed, therapeutic strategies to cure persistent HBV infection almost invariably include approaches to enhance antiviral T cell immunity in order to eliminate HBV-infected hepatocytes.34

The recent success of T cell-based cancer-immunotherapies serves as a proof-of-concept that resuscitation of exhausted or dysfunctional T cells is feasible in the clinical setting and might therefore also be a viable option in the context of persistent viral infection.35

Clinical trials in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and concurrent HBV infection provide the first glimpse of information on the antiviral effects of checkpoint blockade.

In the CheckMate 040-study, a monoclonal antibody against PD-1 was administered to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and HBV infection.

Interestingly, in 3 out of 66 patients a decline of HBsAg-levels >1 log was observed.36

While these data suggest some antiviral capacity of PD-1 blockade, the results are clearly insufficient to advocate this approach as a mono-therapeutic option for chronic HBV infection.

However, so far there is no information from clinical trials on how blockade of PD-1 in vivo affects the circulating HBV-specific T cells.

Data from Raziorrouh et al., looking at the effects of PD-1 blockade on HBV-specific CD4 T cells in vitro, revealed increased levels of HBV-specific IFN-γ, IL-2 or TNF secretion in 4 out of 13 individuals, while the remaining 9 patients displayed unaltered cytokine patterns after PD-1 blockade.14

Thus, these results are in line with our data on blockade of the PD-1 pathway alone in HBV-specific CD4 T cells (Fig. 3) and might also explain the observation that PD-1 blockade in vivo does not significantly improve virological control of chronic HBV infection.

This notion underlines the requirement for additional approaches to improve the functionality of HBV-specific CD4 T cells.

Importantly, tetramer-based analyses of the virus-specific CD4 T cell phenotype ex vivo revealed high expression levels of both OX40 and PD-1 on HBV-specific CD4 T cells compared to Flu-specific CD4 T cells and (Fig. 1), providing a strong rationale to study combined OX40 stimulation and PD-L1 blockade.

Indeed, it has been shown for CD8 T cells that combination of PD-1 pathway blockade and OX40 stimulation has the potential to synergistically augment T cell responses in mice.37

Importantly, our data demonstrate that these synergistic effects can also be observed in CD4 T cell responses, even across different antigen-specificities (HBV, Flu and EBV).

The relevance for receptor expression as a prerequisite for successful immune interventions has recently been described in the context of cancer immunotherapy, where strong PD-1 expression on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was associated with successful checkpoint blockade with nivolumab.38

Yet, the presence of the receptor does not necessarily guarantee a successful therapeutic intervention.

Indeed, although it has been shown that addition of IL-7 can significantly enhance the numbers of antiviral CD4 and CD8 T cells in chronic LCMV infection in mice13 and the IL-7 receptor α-chain CD127 is readily expressed on both HBV- and Flu-specific CD4 T cells ex vivo, addition of recombinant IL-7 did not improve the virus-specific CD4 T cell responses (Fig. 3).

Since beneficial effects of IL-7 on HBV-specific CD4 T cells could not be observed and IL-7 has been implicated in the development and maintenance of autoimmunity,39 we have not performed combined approaches involving IL-7.

PARAGRAPH

In contrast, both OX40 stimulation and PD-1 pathway blockade are clinically feasible options that deserve further investigation in the context of chronic viral infection.

And although the mere improvement of virus-specific T cell responses does not necessarily translate into improved immune control of a persistent pathogen, as has been shown in the murine LCMV model,40,41 HBV-specific T cells can be of great importance in the context of chronic infection where their relevance appears to reach beyond the immediate effect on viral loads.

Indeed, Rivino et al. could show that the presence of core- and / or polymerase-specific T cells was associated with an absence of viral flares in patients following discontinuation of nucleos(t)ide-analogues (NUCs).25

This relevance of pre-existing core- / polymerase-specific T cells in preventing viral flares could be the rationale to target the OX40 and PD-1-pathways in order to boost HBV-specific CD4 T cell responses and improve the outcome of therapeutic strategies that include the cessation of NUC therapy in chronically HBV-infected individuals.

Importantly, we did not detect functional CD4 T cell responses in the majority of patients with suppressed viral titers under NUC therapy (Fig. 2B).

As these patients would be candidates for discontinuation of NUC therapy, expansion of the existing HBV-specific T cells by combined OX40 stimulation and PD-1 pathway blockade could be a therapeutic option prior to NUC withdrawal.

Indeed, although we have analyzed the effects of OX40 stimulation and PD-L1 blockade on T cell responses that have been identified in the absence of these antibodies, the enhancement of low-level IFN-γ and IL-21 producing T cell responses suggests that this approach may increase the number of detectable responses in patients with cHBV.

PARAGRAPH

Of note, this study was performed in HBeAg-negative patients as they constitute the vast majority of patients with cHBV in our clinic.

In light of our observation that patients with higher viral titers are less likely to mount HBV-specific CD4 T cell responses (Fig. 2B) it is certainly possible that the HBeAg status influences various aspects of the HBV-specific T cell response.

However, in our clinical routine, HBeAg-negative patients represent the cohort with the most pressing need for novel therapeutic approaches.

PARAGRAPH

In response to viral infections in mice, CD4 T cells primarily differentiate into Th1 and Tfh cells, in the context of self-limiting and persistent viral infection.27,28

It is unclear whether this is also the case in chronic viral infections in humans.

In order to be able to identify the lineage commitment of HBV-specific CD4 T cells, we analyzed Tfh and Th1 surface markers directly ex vivo, T-bet and Bcl6 as the master regulators of these lineages on the transcriptional level in addition to their signature cytokines IFN-γ and IL-21.29,30

Interestingly, based on the phenotype, cytokine and transcription factor profile, we could not clearly separate a Th1- and a Tfh-population within HBV-specific CD4 T cells.

Indeed, we observed a significant overlap between Tfh and Th1 surface markers directly ex vivo, as well as between T-bet and Bcl6 expression in IFN-γ-producing cells and even slightly higher levels of both transcription factors in cells co-producing IFN-γ and IL-21 (Fig. 5).

HBV-specific CD4 T cells producing IL-21 but not IFN-γ were not observed.

Interestingly, these results are in line with recent observations in the LCMV model, where T-bet was shown to be involved in Tfh cell development and germinal center generation.

The expression of T-bet in Tfh cells was also reflected in significant IFN-γ secretion, particularly during early Tfh cell differentiation.42

Thus, the co-expression of IFN-γ and IL-21 in the presence of both T-bet and Bcl6 as observed in our study could be a sign of follicular helper T cell differentiation, although T-bet and IFN-γ-signatures were much more dominant, suggesting a predominant Th1-commitment.

Further studies will have to analyze the transcriptional regulation of HBV-specific CD4 T cells in the context of chronic infection in order to precisely define helper T cell-lineages within HBV-specific CD4 T cells.

PARAGRAPH

Collectively, our data demonstrate that OX40 and PD-1, 2 promising candidate pathways for immunotherapeutic interventions, are strongly expressed ex vivo on HBV-specific CD4 T cells in chronically infected patients.

Combined ligation of both pathways significantly enhances the percentages of IFN-γ and IL-21 producing CD4 T cells after HBV-specific culture.

These observations may prove useful in designing novel strategies to contain or even cure chronic HBV infection.
