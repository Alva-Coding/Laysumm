TITLE

Impact of cardiac function, refractory ascites and beta blockers on the outcome of patients with cirrhosis listed for liver transplantation

PARAGRAPH

There are still controversies concerning the impact of non-selective beta blockers on outcomes in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, especially in those with refractory ascites.

In this study of 584 cirrhotic patients evaluated for liver transplantation, who underwent right heart catheterization, we have shown that global cardiac performance measured by left ventricular stroke work index is lower in patients with refractory ascites.

Administration of non-selective beta blockers in patients with compromised cardiac performance may increase waiting list mortality.

These results highlight the prognostic value of global cardiac performance in patients with end-stage cirrhosis.
