TITLE

Impact of cardiac function, refractory ascites and beta blockers on the outcome of patients with cirrhosis listed for liver transplantation

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Complex interactions between splanchnic and systemic hemodynamic changes are characteristic features of advanced cirrhosis.1

Splanchnic and systemic vasodilation associated with decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and increased cardiac output (CO) result in a hyperkinetic state.2–4

However, the imbalance between systemic and splanchnic circulation is associated with a state of effective hypovolemia.

Besides hyperkinetic state and effective hypovolemia, so-called cirrhotic cardiomyopathy was described several years ago.5,6

Typically, cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is characterized by (i) a blunted contractile responsiveness to stress, (ii) diastolic dysfunction and (iii) electromechanical abnormalities,5,7 in the absence of other known causes of heart disease.

Such cardiac changes may be present in up to 60% of patients with cirrhosis, especially in those with ascites.8

However, the prevalence of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy has not been extensively investigated.

In addition, some series suggest that cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is not related to the severity of cirrhosis,9 while others suggest a correlation between cardiac changes and disease severity.10,11

Moreover, the impact of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy on the outcome of patients with advanced cirrhosis and on post-transplant survival is poorly understood.11–15

PARAGRAPH

Non-selective beta blockers (NSBBs) are routinely used in cirrhotic patients to prevent variceal bleeding.16,17

However, it has been suggested that NSBBs could be deleterious in patients with refractory ascites with a significant increase in mortality risk.18

However, the deleterious impact of NSBBs in patients with advanced cirrhosis remains a controversial issue.

Indeed, several studies did not find any association between NSBBs and increased mortality in patients with ascites while, in some series, outcome was found to be better in patients receiving NSBBs, suggesting that only a subset of these patients could be at risk.19–22

PARAGRAPH

Evaluation of cardiac function is typically based on echocardiography which enables the measurement of ventricular wall thickness and systolic ejection fraction.

However, diastolic function is also crucial in myocardial performance.23

In routine clinical practice, evaluation of diastolic function is also based on Doppler echocardiography with measurement of E/A ratio, (namely, the ratio of flow velocities of the left ventricle inflow during the rapid passive filling [E wave] and during atrial contraction [A wave]).24

However, interpretation of E/A ratio may be misleading in cirrhosis.25

Firstly, E/A ratio decreases in any condition of central hypovolemia, a common state in decompensated cirrhosis.

In addition, E/A decreases with age and tends to become <1 in patients over 60 years-old due to the physiological slowing of relaxation.26

The use of tissue Doppler imaging echocardiography is also limited by the same confounding factors in cirrhosis.27

PARAGRAPH

Recently, the concept of global assessment of heart function, rather than systolic on the one hand and diastolic on the other hand has reemerged.28

Global cardiac performance can be assessed by a variable termed left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) which reflects the amount of energy available to maintain perfusion of the vital organs.29,30

LVSWI considers not only cardiac output but also arterial pressure, a major determinant in the efficacy of circulation.

Decreased LVSWI has been associated with worse outcome in patients with heart failure.30

Overall, LVSWI is another marker of global heart function, requiring invasive hemodynamic measurements,31 which has not yet been extensively investigated in cirrhosis.

A recent study conducted in patients with cirrhosis has shown that LVSWI is progressively impaired as disease severity progresses, in both relatively hypodynamic (cardiac index <3.2 L/min/m2) and hyperdynamic states (cardiac index >4.2 L/min/m2).32

PARAGRAPH

We hypothesized that NSBBs could be especially deleterious in a subset of patients with cirrhosis, refractory ascites and impaired left ventricular performance or reserve.

The aims of this study were to investigate possible interactions between NSBBs, cardiac performance estimated by LVSWI and outcome in cirrhosis patients evaluated for liver transplantation with or without refractory ascites.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Study population

PARAGRAPH

In this retrospective single-center study based on prospectively collected data including demographic, clinical, biochemical and hemodynamic variables, all consecutive patients with cirrhosis evaluated and registered for a first liver transplantation between 1999 and 2014 were enrolled.

In our center, all candidates for transplantation requiring transjugular liver catheterization, splanchnic hemodynamics and biopsy had right heart catheterization concomitantly as part of standard pre-transplant workup.

Patients who received NSBBs stopped their treatment 48 h to 72 h before right heart and hepatic vein catheterization.33

Patients evaluated for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) did not have transjugular biopsy, but they had splanchnic and systemic hemodynamic evaluation, including right heart catheterization.

Cardiac evaluation systematically included echocardiography with evaluation of systolic function and pharmacological stress test.

If coronary disease was suspected, coronary angiography was performed.

PARAGRAPH

Exclusion criteria were combined liver and kidney, heart or lung transplantation, retransplantation, previous transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), portopulmonary hypertension and patients with documented cardiopathy and/or coronary artery disease whose severity precludes transplantation.

Unstable patients with cirrhosis admitted in the intensive care unit due to severe sepsis, circulatory failure or any other acute life-threatening condition were also excluded.

Only patients in stable hemodynamic status and without ongoing infection were considered.

PARAGRAPH

In France, before 2007, liver grafts were allocated to a transplant center (not to a given patient) by rotation.

In each center, recipients were selected according to waiting time, current condition and donor’s characteristics.

A model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score-based allocation policy, whereby organs are allocated to patients with the highest MELD scores, has been implemented on a national basis since March 2007.34,35

Patients with HCC received extra points so that they would have similar access to transplantation as patients with decompensated cirrhosis, as previously described.34

A list of MELD exceptions, such as refractory ascites and a low MELD score (<15), chronic encephalopathy or hepatopulmonary syndrome was established when the MELD score-based allocation policy was implemented.

MELD exceptions had to be validated by 2 external experts who determined the final score (extra MELD points) these patients would receive and within what time interval.35

For instance, patients with refractory ascites and a low MELD score (<15) were given extra points corresponding to an MELD score of 28.

The maximum score was obtained 6 months after registration.

PARAGRAPH

The study protocol conforms to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committee (IRB 2017-013).

SECTION

Systemic hemodynamic measurements

PARAGRAPH

Hemodynamic measurements were performed in supine position.

An 8F introducer sheet (Baxter Healthcare®, USA) was placed into the right internal jugular vein after local anesthesia with 10 ml of 2% xylocaine administered subcutaneously.

Under fluoroscopic guidance, a triple lumen 7.5F flow-directed Swan-Ganz catheter (Baxter Edwards®, CA, USA) was advanced into the pulmonary artery.

Systolic and diastolic pulmonary pressures (SPAP and DPAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and right atrial pressure (RAP) were measured.

CO was measured in triplicate by the thermodilution technique (Cardiac Output Computer; Baxter Edwards®, CA, USA) with ice-cold isotonic sodium chloride solution.

Mean value was used for analysis.

Transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were monitored continuously during the procedure.

SVR was calculated as follows: (MAP − RAP) * 80/CO and stroke volume index as follows (SVI): (cardiac index/HR) * 1,000).

LVSWI, which reflects global cardiac performance, considering both cardiac and systemic parameters, was calculated as follows: LVSWI = SVI * (MAP - PCWP) * 0.0136.36

SECTION

Splanchnic hemodynamic measurements

PARAGRAPH

The Swan-Ganz catheter was then removed and a Sidewinder II torque balloon catheter (Cordis Corporation®, USA) was placed in the right hepatic vein under fluoroscopic guidance to measure free and wedged hepatic venous pressures (FHVP and WHVP, respectively).

Measurements were performed in triplicate, using the mean value for analysis.

Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) was calculated as WHVP minus FHVP.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Data at baseline were described with frequencies denoted by n (%) for qualitative variables and median with IQR for quantitative variables.

Hemodynamic profiles were compared according to treatment by NSBBs in the whole population and in patients with refractory ascites using Student’s t test, Mann-Whitney test, Chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.

PARAGRAPH

A competing risk analysis was established to determine risk factors of death on the waiting list.

Time to transplantation and time to death in months were considered in the survival regression.

Censure occurred when patients presented with unknown status before transplantation or were removed from the waiting list.

Origin date was registration on the waiting list.

Transplantation was a competing risk of waiting list mortality.

PARAGRAPH

To model the occurrence of the waiting list mortality as the primary event of interest, we used the Fine & Gray regression model, based on subdistribution hazard function.

This model allowed us to measure the impact of covariates on the event of interest.37

First univariate analysis consisted of the identification of potential risk factors of death on the waiting list by applying the Fine & Gray model for each factor individually.

At this stage, the 2 by 2 interactions between refractory ascites, LVSWI and NSBBs were tested.

Thereafter, multiple regression model was created including: (i) variables of interest: NSBBs, LVSWI, refractory ascites; (ii) known risk factors of death in patients with cirrhosis: MELD score and serum sodium, (iii) factors associated with mortality in univariate analysis with p <0.20 and (iv) significant interactions.

Except for variables of interest and known risk factors, factors not associated with mortality (p >0.05) and not modifying the main effects by more than 10% were removed from the final multiple regression model.

Results were given as subdistribution hazard ratios (SHR) and 95% CIs.

Since there was a significant interaction between LVSWI and NSBBs, we then incorporated it in the final regression model, using a new binary composite variable based on the optimal cut-off value of LVSWI (grouped according to homogeneous risk classes).

The cut-off values of LVSWI were based on maximally selected rank statistic for the Gray’s statistic (for details see supplementary information).38

Data were analyzed with R software (version 3.4.2).

Results

SECTION

Patients demographics

PARAGRAPH

During the study period, 925 patients with cirrhosis, with or without HCC, were evaluated and registered for a first liver transplantation (Fig. S1).

Of these, 584 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study.

The main characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1.

There were 453 males (78%) and 131 females (22%).

Median age was 54 years (range 18 to 70 years; IQR 47–59].

Causes of cirrhosis were alcohol abuse in 269 patients (46%) and HCV infection in 168 (29%).

All patients with HCC met the Milan criteria at time of registration, with or without downstaging.

Median laboratory MELD score was 16 (IQR 12–20).

One hundred and ninety patients (33%) had refractory ascites, according to International Club of Ascites criteria.39

Two hundred and ninety-one (50%) were treated with NSBBs, as primary (57%) or secondary (43%) prophylaxis of variceal bleeding.

All patients were given propranolol: 13%, 60%, 5% and 23% were given regular propranolol at the dose of 40 mg/day, 80 mg/day, 120 mg/day, or long-acting propranolol at the dose of 160 mg/day, respectively.

Dose adjustments were decided by the physician in charge of each patient with the objective of a decrease in heart rate of 20–25%.

Risk factors of waiting list mortality including hemodynamic status

PARAGRAPH

During the study period, 102 patients (17%) died on the waiting list, on average 4.5 months after registration, 438 patients (75%) underwent liver transplantation and 44 were removed from the waiting list (8%), due to improved liver function (21 patients), progression of HCC outside Milan criteria (12 patients), extrahepatic cancer (7 patients) and patient decision (4 patients) (Fig. S1).

In the whole population, median waiting time was 4.7 months (IQR 2.0–9.0).

PARAGRAPH

Univariate analysis of risk factors of waiting list mortality in the whole population, considering liver transplantation as a competing event, are shown in Table 2.

The interaction between NSBBs and LVSWI was statistically significant (p = 0.01), while, in contrast, interactions between NSBBs and refractory ascites, as well as LVSWI and refractory ascites were not statistically significant (p = 0.17 and p = 0.26, respectively).

In multivariate analysis, refractory ascites (SHR 1.59; 95% CI 1.04–2.41; p = 0.03) was independently associated with waiting list mortality, taking into account NSBB use, LVSWI and the interaction term between NSBBs and LVSWI (Table 2).

To take this interaction into account, we created a new binary composite variable corresponding to use of NSBBs and LVSWI <64.1 g-m/m2.

The most discriminating cut-off LVSWI value of 64.1 g-m/m2 was determined using the maximally selected Gray’s test statistic in the 584 patients with 353 unique possible values of LVSWI, 74 possible times of death and 102 deaths on the waiting list as events.38

In the final regression model (Table 3), risk factors for death on the waiting list were MELD score (SHR 1.03; 95% CI 1.00–1.06; p = 0.03), serum sodium (SHR 0.97; 95% CI 0.93–1.01; p = 0.19), refractory ascites (SHR 1.52; 95% CI 1.01–2.28; p = 0.04) and the use of NSBBs in patients with LVSWI below 64.1 g-m/m2 (SHR 1.96; 95% CI 1.32–2.90; p = 0.0008).

PARAGRAPH

As shown in Fig. 1A, cumulative incidence of waiting list mortality was significantly higher in patients with refractory ascites compared to patients without refractory ascites (p = 0.003).

Without taking into account the LVSWI values, NSBBs were not associated with a significant increase in waiting list mortality (Fig. 1B).

By contrast, as shown in Fig. 1C, patients receiving NSBBs with LVSWI lower than 64.1 g-m/m2 were at a higher risk of waiting list mortality than patients not receiving NSBBs or patients receiving NSBBs with an LVSWI ≥ 64.1 g-m/m2 (p = 0.0003).

Impact of the MELD score, non-selective beta blockers and refractory ascites on hemodynamic profiles

SECTION

Hemodynamic profiles according to the MELD score and beta blockers in the whole population

PARAGRAPH

As shown in Fig. 2A, mean LVSWI tended to increase in parallel with the MELD score and peaked at an MELD score value between 20 and 25.

Then, mean LVSWI decreased steadily with increasing MELD score.

A similar trend was observed in patients receiving or not receiving NSBBs, even though patients receiving NSBBs had lower values of LVSWI on average (Fig. 2B).

PARAGRAPH

NSBBs were associated with a significant decrease in heart rate, cardiac index and MAP (Table S1).

In parallel, NSBBs were associated with a slight but statistically significant increase in right heart pressures (RAP, mPAP and PCWP).

However, the decrease in cardiac index was not related to a decrease in SVI.

Finally, patients receiving NSBBs had a significantly lower LVSWI compared to those not receiving, NSBBs (Fig. 3).

SECTION

Impact of refractory ascites on systemic hemodynamics

PARAGRAPH

Out of 584 patients, 190 (32.5%) had refractory ascites.

The proportion of patients receiving NSBBs was not statistically significant in patients with and without refractory ascites (Table 4).

The median MELD score was significantly higher in patients with refractory ascites (18 ± 7 vs. 16 ± 6, p <0.0001).

As shown in Table 4, patients with refractory ascites were characterized by a more pronounced hyperkinetic state (significantly increased heart rate and decreased MAP) than those without refractory ascites.

SVR index was numerically lower in the refractory ascites group but the difference did not reach significance.

While mean cardiac index was similar in the 2 groups, LVSWI was significantly lower in patients with refractory ascites.

SECTION

Impact of beta blockers on hemodynamics in patients with refractory ascites

PARAGRAPH

As shown in Table S1, patients with refractory ascites receiving NSBBs had significantly lower heart rate and cardiac index, compared to patients not receiving NSBBs.

Patients receiving NSBBs also had a significant decrease in SVI and a significant increase in SVR index.

By contrast, right heart pressures (RAP, PCWP and mPAP) were similar irrespective of NSBBs.

No statistically significant difference concerning LVSWI, MAP and cardiac index was observed between patients receiving propranolol <120 mg/day or ≥120 mg/day, respectively.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The results of this study conducted in a large series of cirrhotic patients evaluated for transplantation with detailed hemodynamic assessment showed that (i) refractory ascites and (ii) administration of NSBBs in patients with compromised cardiac reserve defined by LVSWI lower than 64.1 g-m/m2 were associated with increased waiting list mortality, independent of the MELD score.

A seminal single-center study has shown that in patients with refractory ascites, NSBBs were associated with a significant increase in mortality compared to a similar group of patients not receiving NSBBs.18

In this study, where a minority of patients were candidates for transplantation, other variables associated with a worse outcome were hyponatremia, impaired renal function and Child-Pugh class C.18 In a cross-over study including a smaller number of patients with refractory ascites, the same authors showed that NSBBs were associated with paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction characterized by a significant decrease in MAP without a concomitant increase in heart rate.40

In another study including candidates for transplantation, NSBBs were associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury in patients with ascites while this association was not observed in patients without ascites.41

Finally, in a large retrospective study, patients with ascites and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis were at an increased risk of hepatorenal syndrome and acute kidney injury when receiving NSBBs.42

The proportion of hemodynamically compromised patients with MAP <100 mmHg was higher among those receiving NSBBs.

Altogether, these studies raised concerns about the safety of NSBBs in patients with refractory ascites, suggesting that these widely used agents could be responsible for deleterious hemodynamic changes resulting in acute kidney injury and, eventually, increased mortality.

The concept of a therapeutic window emerged with evidence of NSBBs conferring no benefit in early cirrhosis, a survival benefit in compensated cirrhosis with medium-large varices, and reduced survival in end-stage cirrhosis including refractory ascites.17

PARAGRAPH

However, since then, contrasting results have been reported on NSBBs in patients with refractory ascites.

Indeed, several studies including a meta-analysis failed to find any association between NSBBs and mortality risk in patients with refractory ascites.19–21

Moreover, the results of 1 study suggested that NSBBs were associated with improved survival in candidates for transplantation with ascites.22

In the absence of clear evidence, the Baveno VI consensus conference recommends not to contraindicate NSBBs in patients with end-stage cirrhosis but to reduce the dose or discontinue NSBBs in cases of low blood pressure and/or acute kidney injury.43

These discordant results also led to speculation that not all patients with end-stage liver disease, but only a subset with compromised cardiac compensatory reserve, would be at higher risk of death with NSBBs.44

The results of our study show that both refractory ascites, and the combination of NSBB treatment and low LVSWI, are predictive of waiting list mortality, supporting this concept.

PARAGRAPH

This study illustrates the complex interactions between systemic hemodynamics, NSBBs and outcome in patients with advanced cirrhosis.

LVSWI is a marker of left ventricular performance, measuring both pump function and workload (preload or left ventricular filling pressure and afterload).29,30,45

In the present series, whether patients had refractory ascites or not, myocardial performance measured by LVSWI increased in parallel with the MELD score up to a limit of 20–25.

Above this limit, LVSWI tended to decline, supporting the hypothesis that advanced cirrhosis is characterized by decreased left ventricular reserve.

Similar trends were observed in patients receiving or not receiving NSBBs.

Interestingly, a recent study has reported similar changes in cardiac index based on classification of cirrhosis using HVPG, a marker of portal hypertension and severity of cirrhosis.32

However, in our series, administration of NSBBs was marked by lower mean LVSWI values and a sharper drop in LVSWI beyond an MELD score of 20–25.

The interaction between NSBBs and left ventricular reserve was more pronounced in patients with a high MELD score compared to patients with less advanced cirrhosis.

In the subgroup of patients with refractory ascites and NSBBs, our results suggest that the drastic decrease in left ventricular reserve was related to impaired left ventricular contractility (stroke volume index) rather than to changes in preload or afterload.

These findings suggest that refractory ascites is a state where a combination of administration of NSBBs and impaired cardiac reserve is associated with insufficient adaptative capacity to preserve adequate systemic perfusion, a condition that could result in organ dysfunction and increased mortality.

Although in this study, detailed sequential data on organ dysfunction after evaluation were not available, these results are in line with previous studies showing an association between the development of hepatorenal syndrome and cardiac systolic dysfunction.11,15

However, this study does not allow us to address the issue of whether increased mortality risk in patients with refractory ascites is related to the administration of NSBBs to patients with compromised cardiac reserve at baseline, to an exacerbated response to NSBBs resulting in compromised cardiac reserve, or to a combination of both factors.

NSBBs were discontinued 48–72 h before hemodynamic measurements.

However, restoration of baseline hemodynamic status is variable from patient to patient.

Time to return to baseline heart rate after discontinuation of NSBBs may be as long as 72 h in patients with cirrhosis.46

Sequential measurements would be needed to address this issue.

PARAGRAPH

In this study, we explored the prognostic value of LVSWI, a reliable marker of left ventricular performance.

We found that this marker identified a subgroup of patients with refractory ascites and compromised cardiac reserve who are at higher risk of mortality when receiving NSBBs.

This finding may have direct implications in clinical practice.

Measurement of LVSWI provides important information on patient’s hemodynamic status.

However, this measurement is invasive with the need for right heart catheterization.

As a consequence, repeated measurements of LVSWI are impractical.

A recent study has shown that in patients with severe mitral regurgitation, non-invasive assessment of LVSWI using echocardiographic methods was strongly correlated to invasive measurement of LVSWI.30

In this study, the authors used the ratio of peak early mitral inflow velocity (E) to peak early diastolic mitral annular velocity (e’) to estimate left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.47

However, there is no clear evidence that estimation of left ventricular reserve based on echocardiography with this technique is also reliable in advanced cirrhosis, since important variations in central volume may occur.

Our study suggests that circulating biomarkers of cardiac reserve may be useful to better stratify patients with advanced cirrhosis.

PARAGRAPH

This study has several limitations.

This is a single-center study with no external validation and median waiting time was short, which may compromise external validity.

However, more than 580 patients with detailed hemodynamic measurements were included.

Measurements were standardized.

In addition, all patients were candidates for transplantation.

These patients were selected at baseline by the absence of major comorbidity that could have represented a contraindication for transplantation and could also represent biases in the interpretation of data.

We found an association between decreased left ventricular reserve while receiving NSBBs and increased mortality risk in patients with refractory ascites.

However, in the absence of serial measurements, this study does not elucidate the precise mechanisms that may explain the deleterious impact of NSBBs.

It is also not possible to conclude whether impaired cardiac reserve at baseline, impaired cardiac reserve induced by NSBBs, or both, are involved.

These results open the way for future studies that include dynamic assessments.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, this study shows that not all patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites are at higher risk of mortality when receiving NSBBs.

However, in a subgroup of patients with impaired left ventricular reserve, NSBBs should not be initiated or should be discontinued as they have a deleterious impact on outcome, independent of the MELD score.

Non-invasive tools are needed to assess cardiac reserve and to optimize the management of patients with end-stage cirrhosis.
