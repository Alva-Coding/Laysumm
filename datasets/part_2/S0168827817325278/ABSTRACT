ABSTRACT

TITLE

Association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis: An observational cohort study

PARAGRAPH

There are limited data on the association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.

This study investigated the influence of NAFLD on subclinical coronary atherosclerosis as detected by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) in an asymptomatic population.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 5,121 consecutive asymptomatic individuals with no prior history of coronary artery disease or significant alcohol intake voluntarily underwent abdominal ultrasonography and CCTA as part of a general health examination.

Fatty liver was assessed by ultrasonography examination.

The fatty liver index and NAFLD fibrosis score were also calculated.

Coronary atherosclerotic plaques on CCTA were evaluated.

The association between NAFLD and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis was determined by logistic regression analysis.

PARAGRAPH

Of the study participants, 1,979 (38.6%) had ultrasonography-diagnosed NAFLD.

After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, there were no statistically significant differences in the adjusted odds ratios of NAFLD for calcified plaque (1.03; 95% CI 0.89–1.20; p = 0.673) and mixed plaque (1.15; 95% CI 0.93–1.42; p = 0.214).

However, adjusted odds ratios for any atherosclerotic plaque (1.18; 95% CI 1.03–1.35; p = 0.016) and non-calcified plaque (1.27; 95% CI 1.08–1.48; p = 0.003) were significantly higher in NAFLD.

In addition, there was a significant association of fatty liver index ≥30 with non-calcified plaque (1.37; 95% CI 1.14–1.65; p = 0.001) and NAFLD fibrosis score ≥−1.455 with non-calcified plaque (1.20; 95% CI 1.08–1.42; p = 0.030).

PARAGRAPH

In this large cross-sectional study of asymptomatic individuals undergoing CCTA, NAFLD was consistently associated with non-calcified plaque, suggesting an increased cardiovascular risk.
