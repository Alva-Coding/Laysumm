TITLE

miRNAs in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis

PARAGRAPH

microRNAs are deregulated in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

The microRNAs, miRNA-34a, miRNA-122 and miRNA-192, were identified as potential biomarkers of non-alcoholic fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, at different stages of disease severity.

The correlation between miRNA expression in the serum and in liver tissue was inconsistent, or even inverse.
