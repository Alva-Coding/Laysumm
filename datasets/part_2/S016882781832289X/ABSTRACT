ABSTRACT

TITLE

miRNAs in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis

PARAGRAPH

microRNAs (miRNAs) are deregulated in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and have been proposed as useful markers for the diagnosis and stratification of disease severity.

We conducted a meta-analysis to identify the potential usefulness of miRNA biomarkers in the diagnosis and stratification of NAFLD severity.

PARAGRAPH

After a systematic review, circulating miRNA expression consistency and mean fold-changes were analysed using a vote-counting strategy.

The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, diagnostic odds ratio and area under the curve (AUC) for the diagnosis of NAFLD or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were pooled using a bivariate meta-analysis.

Deeks’ funnel plot was used to assess the publication bias.

PARAGRAPH

Thirty-seven studies of miRNA expression profiles and six studies of diagnostic accuracy were ultimately included in the quantitative analysis.

miRNA-122 and miRNA-192 showed consistent upregulation.

miRNA-122 was upregulated in every scenario used to distinguish NAFLD severity.

The miRNA expression correlation between the serum and liver tissue was inconsistent across studies.

miRNA-122 distinguished NAFLD from healthy controls with an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI 0.75–0.89), and miRNA-34a distinguished non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) from non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) with an AUC of 0.78 (95% CI 0.67–0.88).

PARAGRAPH

miRNA-34a, miRNA-122 and miRNA-192 were identified as potential diagnostic markers to segregate NAFL from NASH.

Both miRNA-122, in distinguishing NAFLD from healthy controls, and miRNA-34a, in distinguishing NASH from NAFL, showed moderate diagnostic accuracy.

miRNA-122 was upregulated in every scenario of NAFL, NASH and fibrosis.
