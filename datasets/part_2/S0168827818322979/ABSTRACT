ABSTRACT

TITLE

Inactivation of caspase 8 in liver parenchymal cells confers protection against murine obstructive cholestasis

PARAGRAPH

Caspase 8 (CASP8) is the apical initiator caspase in death receptor-mediated apoptosis.

Strong evidence for a link between death receptor signaling pathways and cholestasis has recently emerged.

Herein, we investigated the role of CASP8-dependent and independent pathways during experimental cholestasis.

PARAGRAPH

Liver injury was characterized in a cohort of human sera (n = 28) and biopsies from patients with stage IV primary biliary cholangitis.

In parallel, mice with either specific deletion of Casp8 in liver parenchymal cells (Casp8Δhepa) or hepatocytes (Casp8Δhep), and mice with constitutive Ripk3 (Ripk3−/−) deletion, were subjected to surgical ligation of the common bile duct (BDL) from 2 to 28 days.

Floxed (Casp8fl/fl) and Ripk3+/+ mice were used as controls.

Moreover, the pan-caspase inhibitor IDN-7314 was used, and cell death mechanisms were studied in primary isolated hepatocytes.

PARAGRAPH

Overexpression of activated caspase 3, CASP8 and RIPK3 was characteristic of liver explants from patients with primary biliary cholangitis.

Twenty-eight days after BDL, Casp8Δhepa mice showed decreased necrotic foci, serum aminotransferase levels and apoptosis along with diminished compensatory proliferation and ductular reaction.

These results correlated with a decreased inflammatory profile and ameliorated liver fibrogenesis.

A similar phenotype was observed in Ripk3−/− mice.

IDN-7314 treatment decreased CASP8 levels but failed to prevent BDL-induced cholestasis, independently of CASP8 in hepatocytes.

PARAGRAPH

These findings show that intervention against CASP8 in liver parenchymal cells – specifically in cholangiocytes – might be a beneficial option for treating obstructive cholestasis, while broad pan-caspase inhibition might trigger undesirable side effects.
