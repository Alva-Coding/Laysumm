TITLE

Inactivation of caspase 8 in liver parenchymal cells confers protection against murine obstructive cholestasis

PARAGRAPH

Loss of caspase 8 – a protein involved in programmed cell death – in liver parenchymal cells protects against experimental cholestasis.

Therefore, specific pharmacological intervention against caspase 8 might be a valid alternative for the treatment of obstructive cholestasis in the clinic, whereas broad pan-caspase inhibiting drugs might trigger undesirable side effects.
