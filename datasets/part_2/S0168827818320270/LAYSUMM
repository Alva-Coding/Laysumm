TITLE

Class III obesity is a risk factor for the development of acute-on-chronic liver failure in patients with decompensated cirrhosis

PARAGRAPH

In this study, we identify that among patients with decompensated cirrhosis, class III obesity (severe/morbid obesity) is a modifiable risk factor for the development of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF).

We further demonstrate that regarding the specific organ failures associated with ACLF, renal failure is significantly more prevalent in obese patients, particularly those with class III obesity.

These findings underscore the importance of weight management in cirrhosis, to reduce the risk of ACLF.

Patients with class III obesity should be monitored closely for the development of renal failure.
