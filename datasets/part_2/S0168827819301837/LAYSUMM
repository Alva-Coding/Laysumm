TITLE

Global trends in mortality from intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma

PARAGRAPH

Biliary tract cancers include intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC), however there are some differences in their risk factors.

Consequently, the distinction between ICC and ECC is important.

Over the last few decades, mortality from ICC has tended to rise in several areas of the world, following the increased prevalence of its major risk factors.

In contrast, mortality from ECC tended to decrease in most countries, following the increased use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
