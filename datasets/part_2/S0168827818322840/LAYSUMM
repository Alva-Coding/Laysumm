TITLE

Clinical and histologic features of adults with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in a non-cirrhotic cohort

PARAGRAPH

Individuals diagnosed with classic alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (ZZ) are at risk of liver injury and scarring, because of the accumulation of abnormal alpha-1 antitrypsin in the liver.

A liver biopsy in ZZ individuals can demonstrate the accumulation of alpha-1 antitrypsin within the liver and identify if any associated liver scarring is present.

Indviduals with large amounts of alpha-1 antitrypsin on biopsy may be at risk of liver injury and fibrosis.

Additional common medical conditions of diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol, and hypertension (known as metabolic syndrome) are associated with a greater degree of liver injury.
