TITLE

Interleukin-22 ameliorates acute-on-chronic liver failure by reprogramming of impaired regeneration pathways in mice

PARAGRAPH

A mouse model combining chronic liver injury, acute hepatic insult, and bacterial infection recapitulates some of the key features of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) in patients.

Both fibrosis and bacterial infection contribute to the impaired regenerative capacity of the liver in patients with ACLF.

Herein, we show that IL-22Fc therapy improves ACLF by reprogramming impaired regenerative pathways and attenuating bacterial infection.

Thus, it may have therapeutic potential for patients with ACLF.
