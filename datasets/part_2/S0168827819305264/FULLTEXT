TITLE

Development of a nomogram to predict outcome after liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma in Child-Pugh B cirrhosis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver tumor and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.1,2

When feasible, curative options such as liver transplantation (LT) and resection represent the treatment of choice as they offer long-term survival.3,4

HCC occurs primarily in patients with underlying liver disease, negatively affecting prognosis and increasing the complexity of treatment;5,6 liver cirrhosis, in fact, is an independent prognostic factor for both short and long-term outcomes, and the assessment of liver function remains critical in the management of patients with HCC as selected treatments may induce collateral liver damage, eventually leading to decompensation.7

Child-Pugh classification has been proposed as a scoring system to grade liver function and is currently adopted by most of the available guidelines on HCC treatment.7–13

PARAGRAPH

According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) algorithm which has been advocated by most as the optimal staging system to predict prognosis and guide treatment for HCC, only patients with early-stage tumors may be considered for liver resection as they are associated with long-term survival; furthermore, preserved liver function is required, namely “Child-Pugh A without any ascites, are considered conditions to obtain optimal outcomes after liver resection”.9

Conversely, it is generally agreed that in the setting of Child-Pugh C cirrhosis, patients without significant risk factors should be listed for transplantation according to well-defined inclusion criteria.14

Eventually, no clear recommendations are disclosed for patients with HCC and Child-Pugh B cirrhosis; treatment allocation remains difficult and controversial as these patients have an intermediate, partially compromised situation in between well preserved and terminal liver function.15,16

Patients fulfilling the selection criteria are generally referred for LT, but are at risk of being removed from the waiting list because of tumor progression or liver decompensation: indeed, despite transplantation being a “definitive” treatment as it removes both the tumor and the liver disease, this is limited to a group of selected patients and worldwide organ availability is scarce.

On the other hand, locoregional and systemic therapies are mainly adopted when patients are excluded from LT; in such conditions, survival outcomes have been reported to be worse compared to curative treatments and the hazards of inducing collateral liver damage are still unclear, with some reports disclosing a high chance of decompensation.9,15,16

PARAGRAPH

As a result of recent improvements in preoperative patients' assessment, surgical techniques, and postoperative care, more and more patients with intermediate and advanced HCC or with impaired liver function are referred for liver resection, achieving good short and long-term outcomes.3,17–19

The BCLC recommendations have been questioned as they exclude many patients who may benefit from surgery;20–22 stratification of results within each BCLC class according to liver function is warranted as suggested by the guidelines themselves.9

In this setting, liver resection in Child-Pugh B cirrhosis has been reported as an alternative to LT with acceptable short- and long-term outcomes.14,23–25

Despite this, data is scant and originates primarily from single center case series with a small number of patients, leading to controversy and a lack of shared recommendations.26

PARAGRAPH

The aim of this study was to evaluate the short- and long-term outcomes of patients undergoing liver resection for HCC in the setting of Child-Pugh class B liver cirrhosis, pooling data from international referral centers, and eventually formulating a prediction model for surgical risks and survival.

SECTION

Materials and methods

PARAGRAPH

Questionnaires and databases were sent to 9 Eastern and 5 Western institutions with extensive experience in the multidisciplinary treatment of HCC (Supplementary CTAT Table).

The evaluated variables were the patients’ demographics, disease presentation, type of surgical approach and type of resection performed, intraoperative data (blood loss, transfusions, operative time, Pringle maneuver), short-term outcomes (in-hospital blood works, 90-day morbidity and mortality, hospital stay), pathological details (margins, grading, macro- and microvascular invasion, necrosis, satellites nodules) and oncological outcomes (surgical margins, overall survival, recurrence, treatment of recurrence and disease-free survival).

PARAGRAPH

The following inclusion criteria were set: i) patients undergoing minimally invasive or open liver resection for HCC in the setting of Child-Pugh class B liver cirrhosis; ii) patients >18 years old; iii) anatomical and non-anatomical hepatectomies and iv) patients undergoing up to 1 additional procedure in the liver (i.e. ablation or resection).

The following exclusion criteria were set: i) Child-Pugh class A or C patients; ii) metastatic disease; iii) exploratory laparoscopy/laparotomy without liver resection; iv) main portal vein, hepatic artery, biliary duct or inferior vena cava invasion requiring major reconstructions and v) associated extrahepatic resection.

PARAGRAPH

The primary endpoint was to evaluate the surgical safety, measured as morbidity and mortality within 90 days from surgery.

As secondary endpoints, the long-term oncological outcomes were analyzed.

Prediction models for surgical risks and survival were constructed (see statistical analysis).

PARAGRAPH

Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was obtained from the coordinating center (n° 2018/0316); data transfer agreement and IRB approval were included and requested for all participating centers.

Every case was discussed in a multidisciplinary setting according to the centers' policies and informed consent was obtained from each patient.

SECTION

Definitions

PARAGRAPH

Portal hypertension was defined as the radiological presence of significant splenomegaly, umbilical vein recanalization and/or portosystemic shunts as well as preoperative platelet count <100,000/mm3.27

Whenever hepatic venous pressure gradient was available, a 10 mmHg cut-off was considered as significant portal hypertension.28

Patients comorbidities were graded using the Charlson comorbidity index.29

Major liver resections were defined as the resection of 3 segments or more.

PARAGRAPH

Morbidity was graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification and the comprehensive complication index.30,31

Postoperative ascites was defined as a drainage output more than 10/mL/kg/24 h.32 Post hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) and bile leakage were defined according to the International Study Group on Liver Surgery.33

PARAGRAPH

A margin of <1 mm was considered as an R1 resection.

The microvascular invasion was defined as the presence of tumor emboli within the central vein, portal vein, or large capsular vessels, or involvement of the segmental or sectorial branches of the portal or the hepatic veins.34,35

Grading was defined according to the Edmondson-Steiner classification.36

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Distribution of variables was assessed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Shapiro-Wilk tests.

PARAGRAPH

Data were expressed as the mean ± SD for parametric continuous data and as median and interquartile ranges (Q1–Q3) for non-parametric distribution.

Categorical data were expressed as number and percentages.

PARAGRAPH

Fisher exact test with Yates correction when appropriate were used to compare differences in categorical variables.

Unpaired Student’s t test was used to compare differences in continuous parametric variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous non-parametric variables.

PARAGRAPH

Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time interval from surgery to death for any cause or last follow-up, while disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as the interval from surgery to recurrence in the liver/elsewhere, or the date of the last follow-up.

Kaplan-Meier curves were displayed to evaluate long-term OS and DFS and comparisons were performed with the log-rank test.

PARAGRAPH

To predict the probability of morbidity, a multivariable logistic regression model was performed including correlate predictive factors (p <0.1) at the univariable analysis and clinically relevant variables (Table S1).

A multivariable Cox regression model was applied to identify predictive factors for OS including both correlate predictive factors at univariable analysis (p <0.1) and clinically relevant variables (Table S2).

The same model was applied to predict the OS at 3 and 5 years.

Similarly, a multivariable Cox regression model was applied to identify predictive factors for DFS considering predictive factors at univariable analysis (Table S3).

The same model was applied to predict the DFS at 3 and 5 years.

Cluster robust standard errors were calculated in all models, accounting for clustering due to the variation in model building between institutions.

PARAGRAPH

Bootstrap re-sampling method was chosen for the internal validation of the predictive models’ selecting 500 repetitions.37

For each group of 500 bootstrap samples, the model was refitted and tested against the observed sample in order to estimate the predictive accuracy and bias.

The predictive accuracy of the models was measured using the concordance index (c-index), quantifying the level of agreement between the predicted probabilities and the actual possibility of having the event of interest, and the bootstrap estimate of slope shrinkage but it was not used in the validate models.

In the multivariable logistic model, the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test was also applied.38

PARAGRAPH

Concerning calibration, bootstrapping was used for each model to get bias-corrected (overfitting-corrected) estimates of predicted versus observed values depicted in the calibration plot.

For logistic models, a non-parametric calibration curve was estimated over a sequence of predicted values.

For the Cox models, prediction was made at single time points (3 and 5 years were chosen) and compared with the corresponding Kaplan-Meier survival estimate, stratified by intervals of predicted survival.39

PARAGRAPH

All the prediction models were presented graphically as nomograms; surgical risk nomogram was drawn using the multivariable logistic model for 90-day morbidity.

Survival nomograms were constructed using the multivariable Cox regression models for OS and DFS.

PARAGRAPH

Statistical analysis was performed using STATA software (version 14.0.

CollegeStation, TX: StataCorp, LP) and R software (version 3.3.4, Regression Modelling Strategies package.

The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Patients with missing values on any of the analyzed predictors were excluded from the multivariable analyses.

All analyses were reported according to the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) guidelines.40

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

During the study period, a total of 17,657 patients with HCC and liver cirrhosis at various stages were evaluated in the surgical departments of the authors’ institutions.

A total of 11,983 patients with HCC and Child-Pugh A cirrhosis underwent surgery while 5,674 Child-Pugh B patients were treated as follows: 1,186 (20.9%) underwent cadaveric or living donor liver transplantation, 3,113 (54.9%) underwent locoregional treatments (either ablation, transarterial chemoembolization or radioembolization), 538 (9.4%) underwent systemic treatment and 831 (14.6%) were evaluated for surgery.

After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the current study, a total of 253 liver resections for HCC in Child-Pugh B patients were gathered and analyzed (Fig. S1).

Demographic data are listed in Table 1.

Patients were most commonly affected by viral liver disease (86.5%), followed by alcohol-related (8.7%) and metabolic (4.7%) liver cirrhosis.

Seventy-nine percent of patients had comorbidities with a median Charlson comorbidity index of 5 (3–7).

Most commonly, patients were classified as Child-Pugh B7 (70.3%), followed by B8 (18.5%) and B9 (11%) while the median model for end-stage liver disease score was 9 (6–12).

Median preoperative international normalized ratio was 1.2 (1.1–1.3) while median platelet count was 91 × 103/mm3 (63-151 × 103/mm3) with 145 patients (57.3%) having a count of less than 100,000/mm3.

One hundred and ten patients (43.5%) had preoperative ascites, 98 (38.7%) had preoperative varices and 144 (56.9%) had portal hypertension at diagnosis.

SECTION

Perioperative outcomes

PARAGRAPH

Patients mostly underwent a minor hepatectomy (84.6%) and 122 (48.2%) were operated through a minimally invasive technique (Table 2).

In this latter group of patients, number (p = 0.001) and size (p <0.001) of HCC were lower compared to the open approach.

Furthermore, lesions were most commonly located in the anterolateral segments (73.8% vs. 61.8%; p = 0.04) and less major hepatectomies were performed (4.1% vs. 26%; p <0.001).

Pringle maneuver was used in 35.6% of cases with a median blood loss of 300 ml (63–752) and 68 patients (26.8%) requiring intraoperative blood transfusions (Table 2).

Median operative time was 235 min (155–318).

PARAGRAPH

Eleven patients died within 3 months from surgery with a total postoperative mortality rate of 4.3%; 6 patients (2.3%) died from PHLF, 3 (1.1%) from postoperative sepsis, 1 (0.3%) from acute myocardial infarction and 1 (0.3%) from postoperative bleeding.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 108 patients (42.7%) experienced complications during the study period with a major morbidity rate of 17.3% and a median comprehensive complication index of 20.9 (20.9–33.9).

The most common complication was postoperative ascites (37.5%).

SECTION

Prediction models for postoperative complications

PARAGRAPH

According to univariable logistic regression analysis, comorbidities, Child-Pugh score, platelet count, ascites, and portal hypertension, as well as the type of hepatectomy and approach, increased the odds of postoperative complications while preoperative hemoglobin decreased the odds.

These variables were included in a multivariable logistic model and based on the results of this model a nomogram was displayed showing the probability of postoperative complications (Fig. 1A; https://childb.shinyapps.io/morbidity/).

The year of operation had no impact on the prediction model for 90-day morbidity (odds ratio = 0.95; 95% CI 0.89–1.02; p = 0.170); the model had a good prediction capability with a c-index of 0.79 (95% 0.73–0.84), the bootstrap estimate of slope shrinkage was 0.83 indicating that about 17% of the model fitting was noise.

The Hosmer-Lemeshow test did not indicate evidence of poor fit (p = 0.982), also the calibration plot showed a good calibration, therefore it was not necessary to develop a model using shrinkage (Fig. 1B).

PARAGRAPH

Overall, patients undergoing major hepatectomies had a significantly higher 90-day mortality (10.3 vs. 3.3%; p = 0.04) and morbidity rate (69.2% vs. 37.9%; p <0.001), a higher rate of major complications (46.1% vs. 12.1%; p = 0.002) and more frequently developed ascites (61.5% vs. 33.1%; p <0.001) and PHLF (10.2% vs. 2.3%; p = 0.01); furthermore, readmission rate was higher compared to patients who underwent a minor hepatectomy (30.7% vs. 8.8%; p = 0.001).

Patients undergoing an open hepatectomy had a significantly higher morbidity (52.7% vs. 31.9%; p = 0.001), a higher rate of major complications (26.7% vs. 7.3%; p = 0.01) and more frequently developed ascites (46.5% vs. 27.8%; p = 0.002) compared to patients undergoing a minimally invasive resection; finally, hospital stay was higher (14 vs. 9 days; p = 0.009).

The postoperative outcomes according to type of hepatectomy and type of approach are depicted in Table 3.

SECTION

Long-term oncological outcomes and prediction models for survival

PARAGRAPH

One hundred and twenty-six patients died during follow-up (median follow-up 27 months [9–56]), with 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates of 81%, 57% and 47%, respectively.

According to the univariable Cox regression analysis, Child-Pugh score, preoperative AFP value, number and size of lesions were considered in the multivariable Cox regression model.

In addition, clinically relevant variables such as comorbidities, preoperative portal hypertension and previous HCC treatment, were included; the results of this model were mapped by a nomogram to predict 3- and 5-year survival (Fig. 2A; https://childb.shinyapps.io/survival/).

The year of operation had no impact on the prediction model for OS (hazard ratio = 1.00; 95% CI 0.95–1.06; p = 0.910).

The model had a moderate prediction capability with a c-index of 0.67 (95% CI 0.62–0.73), the bootstrap estimate of slope shrinkage was 0.76 indicating that about 24% of the model fitting was noise.

The calibration plot showed a good bias-corrected calibration except for the group with extremely bad prognosis and the group with extremely good prognosis at 5 years, who had slightly better and worse survival than predicted, respectively, consistent with regression to the mean.

PARAGRAPH

One hundred and forty-four patients (56.9%) experienced recurrence after a median time of 12 months (4–32) with 1-, 3-, 5-year DFS rates of 65%, 36% and 28%, respectively; 48.6% recurred only in the liver, 3.1% in the liver and elsewhere and 5.1% only elsewhere.

The treatment of recurrence was mostly locoregional (67.3%), followed by systemic treatment (18.7%); 19 patients (13.1%) underwent further surgical resection.

PARAGRAPH

Preoperative AFP value, and size of lesions increased the hazard of recurrence at univariable Cox regression analyses.

These preoperative variables were used to build a multivariable Cox regression model and the results were used to draw a nomogram to predict 3- and 5-year DFS (Fig. 3A; https://childb.shinyapps.io/DFsurvival/).

The year of operation had no impact on the prediction model for DFS (hazard ratio = 1.02; 95% CI 0.98–1.08; p = 0.319); the model had a c-index of 0.59 (95% CI 0.54–0.64), the bootstrap estimate of slope shrinkage was 0.98 meaning that only 2% of the model fitting was noise.

Calibration was good, except for the group with extremely good prognosis, as their 3-year DFS was slightly worse than predicted.

PARAGRAPH

Both the 5-year OS and DFS rates of patients with AFP value ≤200 ng/ml and >200 ng/ml were significantly different (OS 51% vs. 31% respectively, p = 0.0002; DFS 29% vs. 16% respectively, p = 0.007.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this reappraisal of the current surgical practice for patients with HCC in the setting of Child-Pugh B liver cirrhosis, liver resection was hampered by non-negligible 90-day mortality and morbidity rates; nonetheless, we showed that strict selection of candidates and minimization of the surgical stress could lower the rate of adverse events, offering good long-term outcomes.

PARAGRAPH

According to most of the available guidelines, surgical resection for HCC is mainly offered to patients with selected tumor characteristics and well-preserved liver function (Child-Pugh A) while patients with advanced liver cirrhosis are excluded or have no clearly recommended treatment (Table S4).

However, the Child-Pugh B category gathers very different degrees of liver function impairment and every patient presents with a unique condition that varies from case to case.

Eventually, the most beneficial and recommended treatment modality in this setting is still controversial; as a result of recent interest in broadening the eligibility for liver resection, surgeons believe that well selected Child-Pugh B patients should not be excluded a priori, as good short- and long-term results could likely be achieved.14,16,23,25

PARAGRAPH

Child-Pugh B individuals are very complex patients, presenting with factors that have been linked to increased postoperative risks such as advanced liver cirrhosis, comorbidities (79%), and portal hypertension (57% low platelets count, 39% varices, 44% ascites).9,41,42

In this setting, a preoperative case selection is critical to reducing the hazards of surgery, possibly identifying the candidate who could profit rather than be harmed from liver resection; furthermore, along with the patients’ presenting characteristics, both type of resection and type of approach were associated with postoperative complications in our study, especially related to liver decompensation.

The volume and function of the future liver remnant are well known to be related with the postoperative course following hepatectomy and should always be considered, preferring limited resections whenever possible according to the extent and location of the tumor, especially in patients with impaired liver function.

Child-Pugh B patients often have no option but a limited non-anatomical hepatectomy, as confirmed by the high rate of partial resections in our study.

Acknowledging the ongoing debate concerning anatomical versus non-anatomical resections for HCC and the related influence on survival, we believe that type of hepatectomy should be balanced with livers’ condition in Child-Pugh B cirrhosis in order to refer the patient to the less hazardous and most oncological safe treatment; in this setting, the removal of a tumor and the preservation of the liver parenchyma are equally important as they both contribute to determining the patient’s survival.7,27

The optimal resection should, therefore, be individualized on each patient considering the tumor, liver’s functional reserve and the severity of cirrhosis.

On the other hand, the minimally invasive approach has recently been linked to lower rates of complications, liver decompensation, and ascites production; this is mainly due to the preservation of collaterals, the reduced liver mobilizations and the lower electrolyte imbalance compared to the open approach.43–45

From the perspective of refining the indications for HCC resection, the advantages of the minimally invasive approach should then be seen as a critical element with a promising role that should be deeply investigated.

PARAGRAPH

Therefore, the impact of hepatectomy on impaired liver function depends mainly on the severity of liver disease, on the type of resection and on the type of approach; as a consequence, limiting the extent of resection and the invasiveness of the technique, as well as patient selection, could eventually reduce surgical stress and improve outcomes.

Unfortunately, according to the tumor presentation, only a limited number of patients might be eligible for both minor resections and a minimally invasive approach; in these cases, we believe that the postoperative risks should be balanced with the benefit in survival that could be achieved with resection; in our prediction models, a calculated likelihood of morbidity is displayed by selecting the patients’ characteristics, the degree of impaired liver function and the type of surgery, while the pattern of the tumor itself is added to estimate survival.

These prediction models were constructed entirely with preoperative variables in order to improve the clinical judgment and to identify the best treatment option and eventually discuss risks, benefits, and alternatives with the patient; we believe that this represents a useful tool in the clinical setting for both the patient and the caregiver.

PARAGRAPH

The results of LR should be compared with other available options, namely LT (both cadaveric and vs. living donation), locoregional and/or systemic therapies.

The selection criteria for intra-arterial and systemic therapies are still not clearly defined in Child-Pugh B patients, nor are the hazards, with some centers reporting a high rate of liver decompensation following both treatments;9,15,16 furthermore, they have been associated with worse oncological outcomes and are frequently considered as a second-line therapy for patients unsuitable for curative treatments.9,13

PARAGRAPH

LT is the best curative option as it takes care of the tumor while restoring liver function; however, the shortage of organs and the chance of dropout from the waiting list together with age, comorbidities and tumor characteristics may preclude this option in a large number of patients.17

In a recent study, surgical resection was compared to LT in the setting of Child-Pugh B liver cirrhosis, showing a long-term survival advantage for the LT arm,25 but higher 90-day morbidity and mortality rates.

As a further issue, recurrence after LT is known to have a rapid progression and a very poor prognosis due to the requirement for lifelong immunosuppressive therapy.46–50

A comparative study between resection and transplantation in this setting should consider patients from the time of LT listing; by these means, the inclusion of individuals who dropout from the list will lead to reliable survival curves on an “intention to treat” basis.

So far, analysis of such a kind, but including patients with all Child-Pugh categories, has failed to show any survival advantage for one or other treatment arm.51

Furthermore, as reported by Belghiti et al., surgical resection and LT should be associated rather than considered separately, offering transplantation as a “salvage” option in case of recurrence or liver failure.52

PARAGRAPH

This study has some limitations: a pooled analysis with a database from centers all around the world certainly introduces some selection bias and carries differences in surgical indications, especially considering Western and Eastern practice.

This was hard to overcome as Asian countries have a more aggressive policy, while Europe and America tend to refer Child-Pugh B patients for LT. Despite this, all the centers agree that these patients should not represent an absolute contraindication to liver resection, but should rather be discussed in a multidisciplinary setting, in order to choose the best available option that minimizes the impact of surgery.

Certainly, when comorbidities, age or tumor characteristics hamper the chance of LT, hepatectomy should be seen as a valuable resource.

PARAGRAPH

This case series is certainly composed of selected patients as Child-Pugh B individuals who are scheduled for liver resection normally show favorable general and liver conditions as well as tumor characteristics according to centers’ selection criteria, resources and availability of alternative treatment modalities; this might bias the applicability of the current prediction models to the average Child-Pugh B patient.

A prospective study that also includes patients with negative predictors is desirable, however, this is far from being realistic in the near future because of the limited number of eligible patients, the strict indication and the difficulty identifying acceptable and shared inclusion criteria.

For the same reasons, it was difficult to pursue an external validation or a cross-validation of the models, which might have increased the risk of overfitting, eventually limiting the application of the nomograms; finally while the morbidity and the DFS models were well calibrated, the OS model showed a lower calibration.

The prediction models presented in this study excluded patients with missing variables rather than using multiple imputation, and this could possibly represent a shortcoming.

Future studies should externally validate these prediction models to test their applicability in different populations.

PARAGRAPH

A surprisingly high rate of major hepatectomies was retrieved from the pooled database.

While this might seem an unacceptable risk to take in such advanced liver cirrhosis, after asking the participating centers for data validation, we found that these cases were extremely selected: Child-Pugh B7 patients with no comorbidities, portal hypertension or ascites and a platelet count >100,000 mm3.

According to our results, the type of hepatectomy was highly associated with morbidity and was the strongest predictor of outcome.

As a matter of fact, we have also observed that major hepatectomies were associated with high morbidity rates even in the case of a minimally invasive approach, meaning that the extent of liver resection is the most important determinant of morbidity regardless of the surgical approach.

PARAGRAPH

It has been argued that the Child-Pugh scoring system has some limitations especially due to the subjective evaluation of ascites and encephalopathy and to the chance of missing acute events such as hepatorenal syndrome or bacterial peritonitis.16

Despite this we decided to stick to the most common and internationally validated scoring system in order to draw internationally reliable conclusions; we believe that further stratification of patients according to the albumin-bilirubin score or the Liver-damage score (which includes the ICG retention rate) are surely important as a second-line analysis.9,13

The ICG retention rate has actually been shown to be an optimal modality for the assessment of functional reserve, and as a useful predictor of postoperative mortality that could be used to determine the liver volume that can be resected according to each patient’s liver condition.43

Furthermore, the evaluation of future liver remnant (either with ICG retention rate, liver volume or hepatobiliary scintigraphy) should be tested as a predictor of postoperative outcomes in these patients.

PARAGRAPH

It is a fact that Child-Pugh B cirrhosis has been named by some authors as a contraindication to surgery for both the negative cancer prognosis and the high morbidity rate.53,54

Despite this, we believe that a negative predictor should not be seen as an absolute contraindication but should rather be compared to the other available options; efforts should be made to achieve improvements in outcomes rather than excluding a potentially curative treatment.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study with sufficient power validating liver resection in Child-Pugh B cirrhosis; it is highly unlikely that a larger sample size study could be drawn given the challenging condition and the limited indication.

SECTION

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

The clinical scenario of a patient with HCC in the setting of Child-Pugh B cirrhosis frequently represents a delicate challenge.

When patients fulfil the criteria for LT, the benefits of this option should be balanced with the waiting list and the scarcity of donors.

When LT is not an option as primary treatment, non-curative treatments should be considered in the context of survival.

In either scenario, liver resection represents a valid choice that could be safely considered in the appropriate setting.

An estimation of the surgical risk and of oncological survival may be useful in deciding whether to undertake one or other treatment while avoiding unpredictable outcomes; accurate patient selection according to preoperative baseline characteristics, tumor burden and liver functional tests, as well as minimization of the surgical stress, could lead to improvements in postoperative morbidity and lead to safe oncological outcomes.
