TITLE

Development of a nomogram to predict outcome after liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma in Child-Pugh B cirrhosis

PARAGRAPH

Liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma in advanced cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B score) is associated with a high rate of postoperative complications.

However, due to the limited therapeutic alternatives in this setting, recent studies have shown promising results after accurate patient selection.

In our international multicenter study, we provide 3 clinical models to predict postoperative surgical risks and long-term survival following liver resection, with the aim of improving treatment allocation and eventually clinical outcomes.
