TITLE

High SVR12 with 8-week and 12-week glecaprevir/pibrentasvir therapy: An integrated analysis of HCV genotype 1–6 patients without cirrhosis

PARAGRAPH

In this integrated analysis of nine clinical trials, patients with chronic HCV genotype 1�6 infection without cirrhosis were treated for either 8 or 12_weeks with the direct-acting antiviral regimen glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P).

The cure rate was 98% and 99% following 8 and 12_weeks of treatment, respectively; the difference in rates was not significant (p_=_0.2), nor was there a significant difference in the cure rates across the two treatment durations on the basis of baseline patient or viral characteristics.

These results, along with a favourable safety profile, indicate that G/P is a highly efficacious and well-tolerated pangenotypic eight-week therapy for most patients with chronic HCV infection.
