TITLE

Risk of hepatitis B surface antigen seroreversion after corticosteroid treatment in patients with previous hepatitis B virus exposure

PARAGRAPH

It is important to know the hepatitis B virus (HBV) status before starting corticosteroid therapy.

Patients with resolved HBV infection without detectable immunity are at an increased risk of HBV surface antigen seroreversion after corticosteroid therapy.

High peak daily doses of corticosteroids (>40â€¯mg prednisolone equivalents) increase the risk of hepatitis flare, but not seroreversion, in patients with previous exposure to HBV, irrespective of the duration of treatment.

Interval monitoring of liver biochemistries is essential for the early detection of hepatitis flares in these patients.
