ABSTRACT

TITLE

Risk of hepatitis B surface antigen seroreversion after corticosteroid treatment in patients with previous hepatitis B virus exposure

PARAGRAPH

Systemic corticosteroids may cause HBV reactivation, but the impact on patients with previous HBV exposure is poorly defined.

We aimed to study the risk of HBsAg seroreversion and hepatitis flare in patients with previous HBV exposure.

PARAGRAPH

Patients who were negative for HBsAg and received corticosteroids between 2001–2010 were included.

Patients who were positive for antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) and/or to HBcAg (anti-HBc) were defined as having previous HBV exposure.

The primary endpoint was HBsAg seroreversion; the secondary endpoint was hepatitis flare (alanine aminotransferase >80 U/L) at 1 year.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 12,997 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria: anti-HBs positive only (n = 10,561); anti-HBc positive only (n = 970); anti-HBs & anti-HBc positive (n = 830) and anti-HBs & anti-HBc negative (n = 636).

HBsAg seroreversion occurred in 165 patients.

Patients who were anti-HBc positive only had a higher risk of HBsAg seroreversion (1-year incidence 1.8%) than those negative for both anti-HBs & anti-HBc (0%; p = 0.014).

Patients with previous HBV exposure had a similarly low risk of liver failure as unexposed individuals (1.1% vs. 0.9%).

The risk of a hepatitis flare started to increase in those receiving corticosteroids at peak daily doses of 20–40 mg (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.19, p = 0.048) or >40 mg (aHR 2.11, p = 0.015) prednisolone equivalents for <7 days, and was increased at treatment durations of 7–28 days and >28 days (aHR 2.02–3.85; p <0.001–0.012).

PARAGRAPH

In HBsAg-negative patients who were only anti-HBc positive, high peak daily doses of corticosteroids increased the risk of hepatitis flare, but not seroreversion.

The rate of liver failure was low and similar in HBV exposed and unexposed individuals; there were no deaths, nor any requirement for liver transplantation.
