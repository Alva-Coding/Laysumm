TITLE

Risk of hepatitis B surface antigen seroreversion after corticosteroid treatment in patients with previous hepatitis B virus exposure

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Chronic HBV infection remains a considerable global health problem despite vaccination.1

Approximately 2 billion people of the world population have been infected; an estimated 257 million people are living with HBV infection (defined as HBsAg positive).2

HBsAg seroclearance, which may occur either spontaneously or after antiviral treatment,3–5 is currently regarded as the functional cure of chronic hepatitis B (CHB).6–8

Neither disappearance of HBsAg in patients with CHB nor recovery from a self-limiting acute hepatitis B guarantees lifelong protection.

Some patients may suffer from occult hepatitis B infection (OBI), a status of undetectable serum HBsAg yet detectable serum and/or intrahepatic HBV DNA.9

Past or resolved HBV infection may still lead to HCC, cirrhotic complications and liver-related death.3–5

PARAGRAPH

HBV reactivation during chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy is a well-known phenomenon and a major concern as it may be complicated by fulminant hepatic failure and death.10

OBI reactivation may take place with increasing HBV DNA replication in patients during immunosuppression therapy.11

Among all immunosuppressive agents, corticosteroids are the most widely used in a spectrum of acute and chronic immune-mediated diseases.12

The degree of immunosuppression increases with dose and duration of treatment.

A daily dose of prednisolone, or equivalent, above 20 mg for longer than 2 weeks is generally considered to induce clinically significant immunosuppression.13

The latest American Gastroenterological Association Institute (AGA) guideline on the prevention and treatment of HBV reactivation during immunosuppressive drug therapy defined HBsAg-positive patients treated with moderate-dose (10–20 mg prednisolone daily, or equivalent) or high-dose (>20 mg prednisolone daily, or equivalent) corticosteroids for ≥4 weeks as being at high risk of HBV reactivation.14

Nonetheless, our recent real-world cohort study showed that even a short course (less than 7 days) of high-dose corticosteroids might increase the risk of hepatitis flares.15

PARAGRAPH

On the other hand, the risk of HBV reactivation in patients with OBI or previous HBV exposure is not as well established.

A recent AGA technical review stated that prolonged courses (longer than 4 weeks) of moderate- to high-dose corticosteroids for >4 weeks may lead to HBV reactivation in 1%–10% of patients; whereas either short courses (short than 1 week) of high-dose corticosteroids or prolonged courses of low-dose corticosteroids only lead to reactivation in less than 1%.16

In this real-world territory-wide cohort study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of the duration and dosage of corticosteroids on the risk of hepatitis flare in patients with previous HBV exposure.

Materials and methods

SECTION

Study design and data source

PARAGRAPH

We performed a retrospective territory-wide cohort study using data from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS) of the Hospital Authority (HA), Hong Kong.

CDARS facilitates the retrieval of clinical data captured from different operational systems for analysis and reporting and provides good quality information to support retrospective clinical and management decisions by integrating the clinical data residing in the Data Warehouse.17

It covers all public hospitals and clinics in Hong Kong and represents data of approximately 80% of the local population.18,19

SECTION

Participants

PARAGRAPH

We first identified all individuals who received at least 1 dose of systemic corticosteroid from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2010 in Hong Kong.

This period was chosen because antiviral treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) was not widely reimbursed in the public sector.

Patients who died within 3 months of the baseline visit, or who had positive HBsAg, incomplete demographic data, concomitant use of other immunosuppressive agents, acute and chronic viral hepatitis, history of liver transplantation, missing baseline or subsequent ALT, or elevated baseline ALT above 80 IU/L were excluded (Fig. 1).

Patients were classified into previous HBV exposure and unexposed groups according to the statuses of antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs) and/or HBcAg (anti-HBc) (Table S1).

Patients were followed up until hepatitis flare or 1 year from the last dose of corticosteroid.

The study protocol was approved by the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong - New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee.

The requirement for informed consent was waived in view of the retrospective nature of this study.

SECTION

Data collection

PARAGRAPH

Data were retrieved from the CDARS in December 2018.

Baseline was defined as the date of the first prescription of corticosteroid.

Demographic data including gender and date of birth were captured.

At baseline, liver and renal biochemistries, hematological and virologic parameters were collected.

Thereafter, serial liver and renal biochemistries were collected until the last follow-up set on December 31, 2018, 1 year after the last dose of corticosteroid therapy of the last individual.

We also retrieved data on other relevant diagnoses, procedures, concomitant drugs, and laboratory parameters.

Relevant comorbidities, procedures, and laboratory parameters were also retrieved and studied.

SECTION

Steroid dosage, duration and indication

PARAGRAPH

Detailed drug information, including dosage and durations, of all locally available corticosteroids (including betamethasone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, prednisone, prednisolone, and triamcinolone) was retrieved (Table S2).

Corticosteroid anti-inflammatory dose equivalents were estimated based on the relative strength of the corticosteroid used.20

Three strata of daily dose equivalents (prednisolone <20 mg, 20–40 mg, >40 mg daily) and durations (<7 days; 7–28 days, >28 days) were set.

Indications for corticosteroids were classified based on relevant comorbidities (e.g. rheumatological diseases and other immune-mediated diseases; respiratory and renal diseases, and anaphylaxis, hypotension) coded within 6 months from prescription.

The diagnosis codes were found to be 99% accurate when referenced to clinical, laboratory, imaging and endoscopy results from the electronic medical records.21

SECTION

Hepatitis flare and HBsAg seroreversion

PARAGRAPH

The primary endpoint in this study was HBsAg seroreversion, defined as reappearance of serum HBsAg.

Secondary endpoints include hepatitis flare, defined as an increase of serum ALT to at least 2x the upper limit of normal (ULN).

The ULN of ALT was defined accordingly to the APASL criteria (40 IU/L for both genders).7

Other secondary endpoints include severe flares with serum ALT raised >5xULN or 10xULN; icteric flare with serum ALT raised >3xULN together with serum total bilirubin >2xULN (i.e. >38 µmol/L).

HBsAg seroreversion was defined as reappearance of serum HBsAg.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Data were analyzed using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) version 23.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois).

Continuous variables were expressed in mean ± standard deviation or median (IQR), as appropriate, while categorical variables were presented as number (percentage).

Qualitative and quantitative differences between subgroups were analyzed by chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests for categorical parameters and Student’s t test or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous parameters, as appropriate.

We determined crude incidence rates (in events/1,000 person-years) with 95% CIs of hepatitis flare.

The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the cumulative probabilities of primary and secondary endpoints based on different corticosteroid dosages and durations; log-rank test was used to compare the cumulative probabilities.

We divided individuals into 2 subgroups based on their dates of birth (those born before 1988 and those born in or after 1988), as 1988 was the time when universal HBV vaccination was available in Hong Kong.

We used Cox proportional hazards regression analyses to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) (adjusted for baseline ALT level and other relevant covariates) and associated 95% CIs.

The following predefined covariates at baseline were included in the analysis: age, sex, ALT, platelet, total bilirubin, and albumin.

All statistical tests were 2-sided.

Statistical significance was taken as p <0.05.

Results

SECTION

Demographic characteristics

PARAGRAPH

We first identified 472,138 individuals who were prescribed with any corticosteroid from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2010.

We excluded patients who did not have both anti-HBc and anti-HBs checked or for whom the results were indeterminate.

Among the 12,997 individuals who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 10,561 patients were anti-HBs positive only; 970 anti-HBc positive only; 830 anti-HBs & anti-HBc both positive; and 636 anti-HBs & anti-HBc both negative (i.e. HBV unexposed) (Fig. 1).

HBV-unexposed individuals were younger, less likely to be male, had higher platelet counts, and had received longer duration of corticosteroid therapy (Table 1).

A total of 165 (4.5%) patients reached the primary endpoint; the 1-year incidence rates of HBsAg seroreversion ranged from 0% to 1.8%; whereas the 10-year incidence rates ranged from 2.2% to 5.5% (Fig. 2).

A total of 1,553 (11.9%) patients had a hepatitis flare (ALT >2xULN) at 12 months; 208 (1.6%) and 73 (0.6%) had severe flares (ALT >5xULN and >10xULN, respectively); and 62 of 9,871 (0.6%) patients who also had total bilirubin checked developed icteric flare.

The median (IQR) peak total bilirubin, international normalized ratio, ALT, and aspartate aminotransferase levels of the 62 patients who had icteric flare were 67 (32–117) μmol/L, 1.21 (0.97–1.57), 311 (98–617) U/L, and 218 (84–452) U/L, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

Most patients had compensated liver function and normal ALT levels (mean 22.4 to 24.8 U/L) at the time of starting corticosteroids.

Follow-up HBsAg was checked in 5,460 patients, with 4,700 valid results for analysis and 165 patients had HBsAg seroreversion at a duration of 3.4 ± 3.1 years from corticosteroid treatment (Table 2); patients with and without HBsAg seroreversion had similar baseline clinical characteristics as well as corticosteroid regimens.

The exception was higher serum ALT level, less positive anti-HBs and more positive anti-HBc in patients who had HBsAg seroreversion.

Among the 553 patients with a hepatitis flare at 1 year, 28/553 (5.1%) patients developed HBsAg seroreversion, which was similar to that of the overall cohort (4.5%) (Table 2).

None of the patients had received antiviral therapy during the study period.

PARAGRAPH

Among patients with previous HBV exposure, 57.5% to 68.6% of patients with previous HBV exposure received short courses of corticosteroids of less than 7 days, while 24.6% to 26.6% received prolonged courses for more than 28 days.

A total of 43.0% of patients received low peak doses of corticosteroids of <20 mg/day of prednisolone equivalent, and 70.9% to 74.2% received high peak doses of corticosteroids of >40 mg/day of prednisolone equivalent.

In unexposed individuals, 74.4% received short courses of low-dose corticosteroids, whereas 31.0% received prolonged courses of corticosteroids.

SECTION

HBsAg seroreversion in patients with previous HBV exposure vs. Unexposed individuals

PARAGRAPH

HBsAg seroreversion occurred in 165 patients.

Patients who were only anti-HBc positive had the highest risk of HBsAg seroreversion, which was 1.8% at 1 year and 5.5% at 10 years (Fig. 2).

Patients who were negative for both anti-HBs and anti-HBc had the lowest risk of HBsAg seroreversion, which was 0% at 1 year and 1.8% at 10 years (Fig. 2).

SECTION

Hepatitis flare in patients with previous HBV exposure vs. unexposed individuals

PARAGRAPH

In the subgroup of patients born before 1988, patients with previous HBV exposure had a slightly yet significantly lower risk of a hepatitis flare compared to unexposed individuals (p = 0.011 by log-rank test) (Table 3); the difference had become apparent 3 months after starting corticosteroids (Fig. 3A).

None of the patients born in or after 1988 had a hepatitis flare.

SECTION

Corticosteroid dosage and duration linked to hepatitis flare but not HBsAg seroreversion

PARAGRAPH

Age, male sex, baseline serum ALT level and corticosteroid peak daily doses of 20–40 mg and >40 mg prednisolone equivalents, as well as treatment durations of 7–28 days and >28 days, were identified as the risk factors for hepatitis flare in univariate analysis.

In multivariable analysis, baseline serum ALT level and corticosteroid peak daily doses of 20–40 mg and >40 mg prednisolone equivalents, as well as treatment durations >28 days, remained the independent risk factors for hepatitis flare (Table 4).

When compared to patients who received short courses of low-dose corticosteroids (<20 mg/day of prednisolone equivalent for less than 7 days), all other combinations of corticosteroids at peak daily doses of 20–40 mg or >40 mg prednisolone equivalents significantly increased the risk of hepatitis flare according to antibody status (Table 4; Fig. 3B [all p <0.001 by log-rank test]).

The 1-year incidence of hepatitis flare was 16.2% in patients who were anti-HBc positive only vs. 26.4% in those negative for both anti-HBs & anti-HBc after high peak daily doses of corticosteroids (>40 mg prednisolone equivalents).

The trend for different durations of corticosteroid treatment was less consistent according to antibody status (Fig. 3C).

Positive anti-HBs was a protective factor, whereas positive anti-HBc was a risk factor for HBsAg seroreversion in multivariable analysis; whereas dose and duration of corticosteroid use did not associate with the risk of HBsAg reversion (Table 5).

SECTION

Other clinical events

PARAGRAPH

Patients with previous HBV exposure had a similarly low risk of liver failure as unexposed individuals (1.1% vs. 0.9%).

Among the 97 patients with previous HBV exposure who developed liver failure after receiving corticosteroids, cirrhosis was present in 6 (6.2%).

No patients with previous HBV exposure or unexposed individuals died from liver failure or required liver transplantation (see Fig. 4).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

This large-scale cohort study aimed to establish the importance of anti-HBs and anti-HBc status in HBsAg seroreversion, as well as the effect of peak dose and duration of corticosteroids on the risk of hepatitis flare in a real-life setting where HBV is highly prevalent.

In the Asia Pacific region, many people have been exposed to HBV and some of them have cleared HBsAg spontaneously.

We found that patients with serological evidence of previous HBV exposure without immunity, i.e. anti-HBc positive only, had an increased risk of HBsAg seroreversion compared to unexposed individuals.

Furthermore, the peak dose but not the duration of corticosteroid treatment had a major impact on the risk of hepatitis flare in HBsAg-negative patients.

Nonetheless, dose and duration of corticosteroid use did not associate with the risk of HBsAg seroreversion.

Fortunately, severe hepatitis flares, icteric flares and liver failure were not common (see Fig. 5).

PARAGRAPH

It is always difficult to study the genuine incidences of HBsAg seroreversion and hepatitis flare in patients with previous HBV exposure, as this condition is often unknown to patients and anti-HBc/anti-HBs will only be checked when ALT is elevated.

Before the era of antiviral treatment, different observational studies reported the risk of HBV reactivation in patients with CHB receiving corticosteroids; interestingly the risk varied a lot from study to study, ranging from only 4% to as high as 50% in different studies.22,23

Most studies on HBV reactivation in individuals with OBI relied on detection of anti-HBc.

In studies where HBV DNA in blood is tested, the risk of HBV reactivation is higher in those with detectable HBV DNA but the risk is also present in those with undetectable HBV DNA in serum.24

Anti-HBs antibody – when present – may progressively decrease during immunosuppressive therapy, and HBV reactivation may occur in individuals who are anti-HBs and anti-HBc positive.25,26

Nonetheless, in our current study, we could only demonstrate an association between the dose and duration of corticosteroid use and the risk of hepatitis flare, but not that of HBsAg seroreversion.

Such a discrepancy in risk might be explained by the fact that self-immunity, as reflected by the presence of anti-HBs, plays a much more important role on HBsAg seroreversion than the immunosuppressive effect of corticosteroids.

PARAGRAPH

In patients with CHB, the degree of immunosuppression by corticosteroids varies depending on the presence of different diseases and the use of concomitant drugs; but in general, the risk increases with dose and duration of treatment.

A daily dose of prednisolone, or equivalent, above 20 mg for longer than 2 weeks is generally considered to induce clinically significant immunosuppression.13

Nonetheless, 1 study showed that a daily dose of prednisolone of 10 mg or less (cumulative dose <500 mg) did not increase infective complications, despite the concomitant use of other immunosuppressants, including disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or TNF-α antagonists.27

In contrast, fatal HBV reactivation may occur with long-term, low-dose corticosteroids (prednisolone 2.5 mg daily) use in inactive HBV carriers.28

Even the use of DMARDs (sulfasalazine and chloroquine) might have contributed to HBV reactivation, yet it was believed that the HBV reactivation was mostly related to corticosteroid use.29

The reported cases of corticosteroid-associated HBV reactivation occurred between 5 to 9 months from the first dose of corticosteroid, without using any antiviral prophylaxis.27,28

Our analysis also showed that patients receiving high-dose corticosteroids for any duration had a statistically significant increased risk of a flare, yet the 95% CI was relatively wide for short (1.16–3.85) and intermediate duration (1.24–4.58) (Table 4).

PARAGRAPH

All key international guidelines recommended the use of NAs according to the anticipated incidence of HBV reactivation,6–8 as the risk varies with different immunosuppressive agents.14,30

In general NA prophylaxis is strongly recommended if the anticipated incidence of HBV reactivation is high, arbitrarily defined as >10%.30

In our previous study, the risk of hepatitis flare in HBsAg-positive patients was very close to 10% (9.3% to 11.6%) in patients receiving high-dose corticosteroids regardless of treatment duration.

In the current study of HBsAg-negative individuals, the risk of hepatitis flare in HBsAg-positive patients was around 5% (1.0% to 5.5%) in patients receiving high-dose corticosteroids for different treatment durations.

NA prophylaxis is recommended, yet not as strongly in moderate-risk scenarios, defined as an anticipated incidence of 1%-10%.

NA prophylaxis is not recommended in low-risk cases with an anticipated incidence <1%.

Yet most of these recommendations were made based on the data from patients receiving chemotherapy rather than steroid alone.30,31

Hence, based on our findings, we propose modifying the recommendations by including patients receiving ultra-high-dose (>40 mg prednisone daily, or equivalent) corticosteroids in the moderate-risk group (regardless of treatment duration), while limiting inclusion into the low-risk group to those receiving daily doses of prednisone, or equivalent, of <40 mg for ≤1 week.14

PARAGRAPH

Our study has the strength of a large sample size of HBsAg-negative individuals with anti-HBs and/or anti-HBc checked, together with detailed drug and laboratory data at different time points.

We also adopted stringent exclusion criteria and multivariable analysis to minimize bias.

Data from real-life cohorts represent a spectrum of patients wider than those in randomized controlled trials, in which patients with multiple comorbidities are often excluded.

The results are thus more applicable to routine clinical practice.

Nonetheless, our study has a few limitations.

First, we have missing data as in other retrospective studies, particularly for serum anti-HBs, anti-HBc, follow-up HBsAg and HBV DNA level, as it was not routinely provided by public laboratories before 2010.

HBsAg was seldom retested once it was found to be negative, as HBsAg positivity was secondary to vertical or mother-to-child transmission in more than 95% of HBsAg-positive individuals.32

Patients who were only anti-HBs positive may have been vaccine recipients, but we could not clearly identify this, as anti-HBc data were incomplete.

Yet excluding patients who did not have both anti-HBs and anti-HBc checked was a negative bias as previous vaccine recipients were included and we might have underestimated the risk of hepatitis flare, hence the subgroup analysis based on year of birth would be meaningful.

Second, fluctuating ALT might not be HBV-related but rather related to other causes, such as drug-induced liver injury, hepatic steatosis, and systemic infections.

As these were not routine assays, HBsAg was only checked in 5,460/12,997 (42.0%) individuals; whereas HBV DNA was not available.

Third, the interval of ALT monitoring was irregular in this real-life setting; this would affect the determination of the time of hepatitis flare.

Last, unmeasured factors might have confounded the results, as we did not have information on medications outside the public system.

We also do not have information on drug adherence or over-the-counter drugs.

Fortunately, corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents cannot be purchased by patients directly over-the-counter, hence the impact should be minimal.

Also, based on our previous studies of similar design, compliance was usually above 80%.33

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, patients with serological evidence of previous HBV exposure, without immunity, had an increased risk of HBsAg seroreversion compared to unexposed individuals.

A high peak daily dose of corticosteroids (>40 mg prednisolone equivalents) is more important than prolonged duration as a risk factor for hepatitis flare in patients with previous HBV exposure; whereas dose and duration of corticosteroid use were not associated with the risk of HBsAg reversion.

Nonetheless, severe hepatitis flares and icteric flares were uncommon; and most of the hepatitis flares did not lead to liver failure or death.

Yet special precaution should be paid to cirrhotic patients, as the risk of liver failure is much higher in these patients.9

Our findings provided important information for the risk stratification and categorization of hepatitis flare in patients receiving corticosteroids.

Patients born before the era of universal vaccination who are going to receive high-dose corticosteroids should have anti-HBs and anti-HBc checked.

While pre-emptive antiviral treatment with NAs is recommended for high-risk patients, regular surveillance of HBV reactivation by interval monitoring of liver biochemistries and serum HBV DNA are essential to determine whether and when to commence antiviral treatment in patients at a low- to moderate-risk of HBV reactivation, in order to prevent severe hepatitis, decompensation or even liver failure.
