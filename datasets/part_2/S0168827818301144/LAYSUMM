TITLE

Impaired cerebral microcirculation induced by ammonium chloride in rats is due to cortical adenosine release

PARAGRAPH

In patients with liver failure, disturbances in brain function are caused in part by ammonium toxicity.

In our project we studied how ammonia, through adenosine release, affects the blood flow in the brain of rats.

In our experimental model we demonstrated that the detrimental effect of ammonia on blood flow regulation was counteracted by blocking the adenosine receptors in the brain.

With this observation we identified a novel potential treatment target.

If we can confirm our findings in a future clinical study, this might help patients with liver failure and the severe condition called hepatic encephalopathy.
