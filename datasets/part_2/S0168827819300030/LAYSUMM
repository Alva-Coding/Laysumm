TITLE

Live donor liver transplantation for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma offers increased survival vs. deceased donation

PARAGRAPH

Liver transplantation (LT) offers the best chance of survival for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and can be performed using grafts from deceased donors or live donors.

In this work, we aimed to assess the differences in survival after live donor LT when compared to deceased donor LT. We studied 219 patients listed for live donor LT and 632 patients listed for deceased donor LT. Patients who had a potential live donor at the time of listing had a higher survival rate.

Therefore, being listed for a live donor LT was a protective factor against death.
