TITLE

Role of liver and spleen stiffness in predicting the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after resection

PARAGRAPH

The main result of this study is that spleen stiffness measurement, evaluated by transient elastography, seems to be the only predictor of the late recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma, defined as recurrence after 24â€¯months from liver resection.

Indeed, spleen stiffness measurement is directly correlated with the degree of liver disease and portal hypertension, which are both involved in carcinogenesis.
