TITLE

Genomic characterization of biliary tract cancers identifies driver genes and predisposing mutations

PARAGRAPH

We here analyzed genomic features of 412 BTC samples from Japanese and Italian populations.

A total of 32 significantly and commonly mutated genes were identified, some of which negatively affected patient prognosis, including a novel deletion of MUC17 at 7q22.1.

Cell-of-origin predictions using WGS and epigenetic features suggest hepatocyte-origin of hepatitis-related ICCs.

Deleterious germline mutations of cancer-predisposing genes were detected in 11% of patients with BTC.

BTCs have distinct genetic features including somatic events and germline predisposition.
