TITLE

Development of models estimating the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma after antiviral treatment for hepatitis C

PARAGRAPH

Most patients with hepatitis C virus have been treated or will be treated with direct-acting antivirals.

It is important that we can model the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in these patients, so that we develop the optimum screening strategy that avoids unnecessary screening, while adequately screening those at increased risk.

Herein, we have developed and validated models that are available as web-based tools that can be used to guide screening strategies.
