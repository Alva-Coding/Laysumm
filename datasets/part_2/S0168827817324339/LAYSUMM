TITLE

Macrophage scavenger receptor 1 contributes to pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis via neutrophil-mediated complement activation

PARAGRAPH

Virus-induced fulminant hepatitis (FH) is a disease with a high mortality worldwide.

Enhanced levels of macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (Msr1) in the liver of patients with FH and of murine experimental FH indicated Msr1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of FH.

Herein, we demonstrate that mice deficient in Msr1 are resistant to FH induced by MHV-A59, and the Msr1 inhibitor fucoidan suppresses the progression of FH in mice.

Our study suggests that use of drugs inhibiting MSR1 function could be beneficial to patients with FH.
