ABSTRACT

TITLE

Hepatitis C reinfection after successful antiviral treatment among people who inject drugs: A meta-analysis

PARAGRAPH

/Aims: HCV reinfection following successful treatment can compromise treatment outcome.

This systematic review assessed the rate of HCV reinfection following treatment among people with recent drug use and those receiving opioid agonist therapy (OAT).

PARAGRAPH

Bibliographic databases and conference abstracts were searched for studies assessing post-treatment HCV reinfection rate among people with recent drug use (injecting or non-injecting) or those receiving OAT.

Meta-analysis was used to cumulate reinfection rates and meta-regression to explore heterogeneity.

PARAGRAPH

Thirty-six studies were included (person-years follow-up=6,311).

The overall rate of HCV reinfection was 5.9/100 person-years (95%CI: 4.1-8.5) among people with recent drug use (injecting or non-injecting), 6.2/100 person-years (95%CI: 4.3-9.0) among people recently injecting drugs, and 3.8/100 person-years (95%CI: 2.5-5.8) among those receiving OAT.

Reinfection rates were comparable following interferon-based (5.4/100 person-years; 95%CI: 3.1-9.5), and direct-acting antiviral therapy (3.9/100 person-years; 95%CI: 2.5-5.9).

In stratified analysis, reinfection rate was 1.4/100 person-years (95%CI: 0.8-2.6) among people receiving OAT with no recent drug use, 5.9/100 person-years (95%CI: 4.0-8.6) among people receiving OAT with recent drug use, and 6.6/100 person-years (95%CI: 3.4-12.7) among people with recent drug use, not receiving OAT.

In meta-regression analysis, longer follow-up was associated with lower reinfection rate [adjusted Rate Ratio (aRR) per year increase in mean/median follow-up: 0.77, 95%CI: 0.69-0.86].

Compared with people receiving OAT with no recent drug use, those with recent drug use, receiving OAT (aRR: 3.50, 95%CI: 1.62-7.53), and those with recent drug use, not receiving OAT (aRR: 3.96, 95%CI: 1.82-8.59) had higher reinfection rates.

PARAGRAPH

HCV reinfection risk following treatment increased among people with recent drug use compared to those receiving OAT.

Lower rates in studies with longer follow-up suggested higher reinfection risk early post-treatment.
