TITLE

Hepatitis C reinfection after successful antiviral treatment among people who inject drugs: A meta-analysis

SECTION

INTRODUCTION

PARAGRAPH

Globally, among the 71 million people living with hepatitis C virus (HCV) [1], 6.1 million (8.6%) injected drugs during the previous year [2].

HCV transmission continues to occur among people who have recently injected drugs [3-6].

Increasing access to HCV prevention services and HCV treatment among people who inject drugs will be critical to achieve the World Health Organization goal of eliminating HCV as a major global public health threat by 2030 [7].

PARAGRAPH

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for HCV infection is effective among people who have recently injected drugs [8].

In many countries, people who have not ceased injecting drug use are ineligible to receive HCV treatment, either because of clinical guidelines or due to restrictions for government reimbursement of therapy [9, 10].

A major concern is that ongoing injecting risk behaviours following DAA therapy may lead to HCV reinfection, reversing the benefit of cure [11].

Given that DAA therapy is expensive, data on the magnitude of post-treatment HCV reinfection risk is crucial to guide clinical decision making and policy in this area.

PARAGRAPH

Although there have been three systematic reviews evaluating the rate of HCV reinfection among people who inject drugs [12-14], there is only one performed in the DAA era (included five studies) [13].

These systematic reviews are limited by the inclusion of studies with heterogeneous study populations, small numbers of identified studies, limited sub-group analysis, and lack of data on persistent HCV reinfection.

To our knowledge, there has been no published meta-regression analysis to assess the study-level factors associated with HCV reinfection rate.

PARAGRAPH

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the rate of HCV reinfection following successful HCV treatment (interferon-based and DAA) among well-defined populations of individuals with recent drug use, including those with recent injecting drug use, and individuals receiving OAT.

Factors explaining heterogeneity across studies were also assessed.

SECTION

METHODS

PARAGRAPH

This study is reported based on the PRISMA statement [15].

Study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (PROSPERO 2018 CRD42018114765).

SECTION

Eligibility criteria

PARAGRAPH

We included prospective and retrospective studies, investigating HCV reinfection following HCV treatment, if they met all the following criteria:

Study population included defined populations of people with recent drug use or people receiving OAT

Reinfection following treatment-induced HCV clearance (interferon-based or DAA therapy) was assessed

Reinfection rate, including person-years follow-up was reported.

PARAGRAPH

Studies including participants with former or current drug use were included when the data specifically for those with recent drug use were available.

“Recent drug use” was considered as injecting or non-injecting drug use within six months prior to treatment initiation, during treatment, at the end of treatment, or during post-treatment follow-up.

Other definitions referring to active drug use at the time of study entry were also accepted for inclusion.

Studies with <10 person-years follow-up were excluded.

SECTION

Information sources and search

PARAGRAPH

Literature searches of five bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE (Pubmed), Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and PsycINFO were performed.

Presentations at the key viral hepatitis conferences were searched, including International Liver CongressTM, The Liver Meeting®, Annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), and International Symposium on Hepatitis Care in Substance Users (INHSU).

ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for unpublished or ongoing studies.

Reference lists of the articles included in the analysis, and relevant review articles were hand searched.

Forward citation tracking was carried out, using Scopus.

Searches were performed in October 2018, and updated in June 2019.

No time restriction was applied for the search results.

PARAGRAPH

The details of the search strategies are provided in Supplementary Table 1.

In brief, combinations of search terms were used, relating to HCV, drug use, OAT, HCV treatment, and reinfection/reviraemia.

SECTION

Study selection

PARAGRAPH

The records found through primary search were initially screened by title and abstract.

The full-text of potentially eligible records were reviewed, and eligible studies were selected for inclusion (Figure 1).

In the case of multiple publications of one study, the one with the most updated data was included.

SECTION

Data collection process and data items

PARAGRAPH

Required data were extracted into a standardized spreadsheet.

The extracted data included the items related to study design and setting, definition of recent drug use and OAT, study participant characteristics, HCV treatment, post-treatment follow-up, and HCV reinfection (Table 1).

Authors were contacted if supplementary data were required.

SECTION

Risk of bias in individual studies

PARAGRAPH

The risk of bias for the included studies was assessed using a modified scale derived from Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale for cohort studies [16], including eight items with a total score of nine (Supplementary Table 2).

Studies with a score of <6, 6–7, and >7 were considered as having high, moderate, and low risk of bias, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

Two or more reviewers independently carried out title/abstract screening (EC, HV), full text review (BH, EC, JG), data extraction (BH, EC, HV), and critical appraisal (BH, EC, HV, JG), with discrepancies discussed in the group to reach consensus.

SECTION

Synthesis of results

PARAGRAPH

The primary outcome was the rate of HCV reinfection.

The secondary outcome was the rate of persistent HCV reinfection.

HCV reinfection was defined as the detection of HCV RNA following an end of treatment response (i.e., non-quantifiable HCV RNA at the end of treatment) or following sustained virologic response [SVR, i.e., non-quantifiable HCV RNA at 12 (SVR12) or 24 (SVR24) weeks after the end of treatment].

In studies using end of treatment to indicate the beginning of the time at risk for HCV reinfection, HCV RNA recurrence was considered as reinfection if HCV sequencing or genotype data were used to confirm detection of infection with an HCV strain, subtype or genotype distinct from the virus prior to treatment.

In the studies using SVR to indicate the beginning of the time at risk for HCV reinfection, any HCV RNA recurrence was considered as reinfection, given the low likelihood of viral relapse after SVR [17, 18].

Persistent HCV reinfection refers to the detection of HCV RNA at least 24 weeks following reinfection.

For each included study, the rate of HCV reinfection was calculated, using the reported number of reinfection cases and person-years follow-up.

A fixed continuity correction of 0.5 was applied in studies with no cases of reinfection.

Log transformed rates were used in all analyses, and back-transformed for reporting.

Heterogeneity across studies was assessed using the I-square statistic, with an I-square <25%, 25%-75%, and >75% considered as low, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively [19].

Random effect meta-analysis models were used to cumulate the rate estimates.

PARAGRAPH

Study-level factors contributing to heterogeneity of the outcome were assessed using stratified analysis and meta-regression.

Stratified analyses were performed by HCV treatment (interferon-based, versus DAA therapy), risk of bias, and exclusive study population risk groups (based on recent drug use and OAT status).

In studies combining populations of people with recent drug use and people receiving OAT, sub-population data were used in the risk group analyses.

PARAGRAPH

In meta-regression, the covariates were determined a priori and included study design, study setting, study population risk groups, participants’ mean/median age, proportion of men, proportion with HIV co-infection, HCV treatment, mean/median post-treatment follow-up, visit when HCV reinfection risk assessment began (e.g. end of treatment or SVR), HCV testing interval during follow-up, and study quality assessment score.

The final adjusted model included variables with P<0.10 in unadjusted analyses (0.10 was used as the P value cut-off to avoid model instability).

Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Begg’s test.

Statistical significances were assessed at P<0.05 (P-values are two sided).

All analyses were performed using Stata 14.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).

RESULTS

SECTION

Study selection

PARAGRAPH

A total of 1,160 records in bibliographic databases and 43 records from other sources were identified in the initial search, while 36 eligible studies were eventually included in the analysis (Figure 1).

SECTION

Study characteristics

PARAGRAPH

Thirty-six studies [20-55] with a total 6,311 person-years follow-up were included (Tables 1 and 2).

Twenty-two studies (61%) reported the proportion of participants with no post-treatment follow-up assessment (loss to follow-up), which was between zero and 38% (median: 10%).

In most studies, recent drug use and receiving OAT were defined as drug use (n=19) and OAT (n=17) during HCV treatment or post-treatment follow-up.

Drug use referred to “injecting or non-injecting” drug use in three studies and “injecting only” drug use in 32 studies.

HCV treatment was interferon-based therapy in 17 studies, including one study for acute HCV infection [41], and DAA therapy in 19 studies.

In most studies, HCV reinfection assessment started from end of treatment (n=14), or SVR12 (n=11).

Diagnosis of reinfection was often based on HCV RNA detection following SVR (n=14), or detection of different HCV strain using viral sequencing (n=10).

SECTION

Risk of bias within studies

PARAGRAPH

The risk of bias assessment scores is shown in Supplementary Table 3.

Risk of bias was high in four studies (score <6), moderate in 23 studies (score: 6–7), and low in nine studies (score >7).

SECTION

Synthesis of results

PARAGRAPH

Data on the rate of HCV reinfection were available for people with recent drug use (injecting or non-injecting) in 33 studies (5,061 person-years follow-up) [20-25, 27-37, 39-53, 55], for people with injecting drug use in 31 studies (4,648 person-years follow-up) [20-25, 27-36, 39-44, 46-53, 55], and for those receiving OAT in 25 studies (2,507 person-years follow-up) [20, 22, 24-26, 28, 29, 31-35, 38-42, 44-49, 51, 54].

The pooled estimates of reinfection rates were 5.9 per 100 person-years (95%CI: 4.1, 8.5) among people with recent injecting or non-injecting drug use, 6.2 per 100 person-years (95%CI: 4.3, 9.0) among people with recent injecting drug use, and 3.8 per 100 person-years (95%CI: 2.5, 5.8) among those receiving OAT (Figure 2).

High heterogeneity was observed across studies, although lower across studies among people receiving OAT (I-square=56.9%), than studies among people with recent drug use (I-square=81.4%) and studies among those with recent injecting drug use (I-square=81.2%; Figure 2).

In a sensitivity analysis, excluding two linkage-based Canadian studies contributing the largest person-years follow-up [39, 47], the pooled reinfection rates slightly increased while heterogeneity decreased (Supplementary Table 4).

The funnel plots of reinfection rates and the Begg’s test showed no significant evidence of publication bias (Supplementary Figure 1).

PARAGRAPH

Twenty-four studies with 3,381 person-years follow-up provided data on the rate of persistent HCV reinfection [20, 22, 24-26, 28, 31, 32, 34, 37, 38, 41-49, 51, 52, 54, 55].

The pooled rate estimates were 5.1 per 100 person-years (95%CI: 3.6, 7.1; I-square=58.2%) among people with recent drug use, 5.4 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 3.9, 7.5; I-square=51.2%) among people with recent injecting drug use, and 3.4 per 100 person-years (95%CI: 2.5, 4.6; I-square=15.0%), among those receiving OAT.

PARAGRAPH

None of the studies reported any case of fulminant hepatitis or acute-on-chronic liver failure following HCV reinfection.

SECTION

Stratified analysis

PARAGRAPH

Sub-populations of people with recent drug use and those receiving OAT have overlaps given that many participants with recent drug use were also receiving OAT.

For stratified analysis, data of exclusive study population/sub-populations, based on recent drug use and OAT status (no overlap) were extracted.

For 30 studies, supplementary data were provided by the authors.

HCV reinfection rates by study population risk groups are illustrated in Figure 3.

The lowest rate was identified among people receiving OAT, with no recent drug use (1.4 per 100 person-years; 95%CI: 0.8, 2.6).

Increased reinfection rates were identified among people with recent drug use who were or were not receiving OAT, with the highest rate identified among people with recent drug use, not receiving OAT (6.6 per 100 person-years; 95%CI: 3.4, 12.7; Figure 3A).

Restricting the analysis to studies providing data on injecting drug use, the results were similar (Figure 3B).

PARAGRAPH

Stratified analysis by HCV treatment regimen indicated comparable rates of reinfection following interferon-based therapy (5.4 per 100 person-years; 95%CI: 3.1, 9.5) and DAA therapy (3.9 per 100 person-years; 95%CI: 2.5, 5.9; Figure 4).

PARAGRAPH

In stratified analysis by risk of bias, no significant difference was observed in rates of reinfection across different groups although studies with low risk of bias reported relatively higher rates (Supplementary Table 5).

SECTION

Meta-regression

PARAGRAPH

In the adjusted meta-regression model, having a study population with recent drug use was associated with a higher rate of reinfection, while higher mean/median age of participants and longer mean/median post-treatment follow-up were associated with lower rate of reinfection.

Compared to people receiving OAT, with no recent drug use, those with recent drug use who also received OAT had 3.5 times higher risk of reinfection [adjusted Rate Ratio (RR): 3.50, 95%CI: 1.62, 7.53; P=0.002), and those with recent drug use, not receiving OAT had four times higher risk of reinfection (adjusted RR: 3.96; 95%CI: 1.82, 8.59; P=0.001).

Risk of reinfection was decreased by 6% for each year increase in mean/median age of study participants (adjusted RR: 0.94; 95%CI: 0.91, 0.97; P<0.001), and decreased by 23% by each year increase in mean/median post-treatment follow-up (adjusted RR: 0.77; 95%CI: 0.69, 0.86; P<0.001) (Table 3).

Restricting the meta-regression analysis to the studies providing data on injecting drug use, no major difference was observed in the results.

The residual I-square of the adjusted model was 9%, indicating that the factors included in the model explained a large proportion of heterogeneity across studies (Table 4).

DISCUSSION

PARAGRAPH

This study provides estimates of the rate of reinfection following successful HCV treatment among people with recent drug use (5.9 per 100 person-years), people with recent injecting drug use (6.2 per 100 person-years), and those receiving OAT (3.8 per 100 person-years).

Among people with recent drug use, not receiving OAT, the reinfection rate was 6.6 per 100 person-years.

In meta-regression analysis, recent drug use was associated with higher risk of reinfection, while older age and longer follow-up was associated with lower risk.

This study provides robust data on the magnitude of HCV reinfection risk following treatment, important to inform HCV clinical guidelines globally and public health policy decisions around treatment access and national strategies to guide HCV elimination efforts.

PARAGRAPH

The estimated HCV reinfection rate of 6.2 per 100 person-years among people who have recently injected drugs is higher than previous systematic reviews (1.9 to 2.4 per 100 person-years) [12-14], but consistent with an estimate among people with ongoing injecting drug use in the interferon era (6.4 per 100 person-years) [12].

Given the small number of studies, and person-years follow-up, this previous estimate is limited by a wide uncertainty range (95% CI, 2.5 to 16.7) [12].

Previous systematic reviews have also been limited by inclusion of heterogenous study populations with former or current drug use [12, 14], and the small number of studies identified (particularly in the DAA era) [12-14].

The large number of included studies, and person-years follow-up, and well-defined study populations in this study provide a more precise estimate of the rate of HCV reinfection among people with recent drug use and those receiving OAT.

Moreover, the considerable efforts made to contact the authors to collect supplementary data is a major strength of the current study, enabling sub-group and meta-regression analyses.

PARAGRAPH

The pooled rate of HCV reinfection among people with recent injecting drug use in this study (6.2 per 100 person-years) is lower than reported rates of primary HCV infection in the community.

In a pooled analysis of seven studies of people who inject drugs from four countries, HCV incidence was 23 per 100 person-years, ranging from 7 to 33 per 100 person-years [3].

The lower rate of HCV reinfection compared to primary infection could be related to various factors, including reduced risk behaviors among people who have received HCV treatment and a difference in the risk profiles among people at risk of primary infection and reinfection, with low-risk individuals more probably engaged in care.

PARAGRAPH

Our finding of significantly lower reinfection risk among people receiving OAT who did not use drugs, indicates the importance of enhancing access to OAT as a strategy to prevent reinfection.

One study demonstrated that lower OAT dose is associated with higher HCV incidence [56], suggesting that in addition to improving OAT access, ensuring appropriate OAT dosing may also be important for HCV prevention.

PARAGRAPH

This study demonstrated a higher rate of HCV reinfection in studies with shorter follow-up.

One explanation of this finding is that there is a higher risk of reinfection in the early period following treatment completion.

Alternatively, this finding may be due to bias resulting from a cohort effect, with high-risk individuals contributing shorter person-years of follow-up due to becoming reinfected early post-treatment or loss to follow-up.

Future studies of HCV reinfection require strategies to enhance study follow-up and ensure there is adequate person-years of post-treatment follow-up to minimize the potential for bias.

PARAGRAPH

Comparable rates of HCV reinfection were observed following interferon-based and DAA therapy in this study.

There have been concerns from some practitioners that the broadening of HCV DAA therapy to more marginalized populations might lead to increased rates of reinfection.

Further, it has been suggested that the ease and high cure rates of DAA therapy might lead to increased risk behaviours among people who inject drugs as compared to interferon-based therapies.

However, there are now several studies demonstrating that injecting risk behaviours remain stable or decrease during and following interferon-based and DAA therapy [57-60].

Collectively, these data suggest that there is no difference in the rate of reinfection following interferon or DAA therapy.

PARAGRAPH

It should be acknowledged that early stages of HCV treatment scale-up among high-risk populations will result in increased HCV reinfection [61].

Rapid scale-up of treatment will lead to a greater number of people clearing the virus, thereby increasing the pool of people who are susceptible to reinfection and potentially increasing the number of people with reinfection.

As the prevalence of HCV infection decreases, the numbers with HCV reinfection should also decrease.

Slow scale-up of treatment has a more limited effect on the reservoir of HCV infection, so the numbers with reinfection will continue to increase.

Increased numbers of HCV reinfection cases in the context of treatment scale-up should be viewed as a marker of high treatment uptake among at-risk populations, but also an indication that other harm reduction interventions may need to be intensified [62].

PARAGRAPH

It should be acknowledged that HCV reinfection following successful treatment can increase the overall health system costs within an HCV elimination program since people with HCV reinfection require multiple courses of treatment.

As such, it is critical to have complementary strategies to prevent and manage HCV reinfection [63, 64].

At an individual level, prior to initiating DAA therapy, an assessment of HCV reinfection risk should be performed by the treating clinician.

Management options include identifying populations with potential reinfection risk, education and counselling regarding HCV transmission and drug use (particularly the importance of using sterile needles/syringes), optimising access to harm reduction services [39, 63, 65, 66], treating the individual, their injecting (or sexual) partner and people in their injecting network [67], management of medical and psychiatric co-morbidities [39], post-treatment surveillance [68], and rapid retreatment of reinfection.

At a population-level, appropriate healthcare provision with universal access to HCV treatment and harm reduction services, adequate funding (for both DAA therapy and harm reduction programs), and alleviation of the stigma associated with HCV infection and drug use should assist in efforts to reduce HCV primary and reinfection incidence.

If HCV reinfection does occur, retreatment for reinfection should be offered, without stigma or discrimination, to reduce further potential transmission.

PARAGRAPH

This study provides the most comprehensive review of HCV reinfection following successful treatment among people who inject drugs performed to date, but has several limitations.

A high heterogeneity in rates of HCV reinfection was observed across studies.

The residual I-square in adjusted meta-regression models were 21% and 9%, indicating that the factors included in the model explained a large proportion of heterogeneity across studies.

The residual heterogeneity may be explained by other factors not considered in our analysis due to lack of data, including varying risk profiles or inclusion criteria for study populations, the population-level prevalence and incidence of HCV infection, and the coverage of harm reduction services.

In most studies, all cases of recurrent viraemia following SVR were considered as reinfection.

Although post-SVR HCV relapse is rare [17, 18], this method without using HCV sequencing cannot fully distinguish reinfection from late relapse.

In several studies, reinfection was diagnosed on the basis of detection of recurrent viraemia with different HCV genotype/subtype.

In rare occasions, genotype-specific HCV treatment among people with mixed HCV infection (infection with multiple viruses) can result in the eradication of one genotype, but not another [69].

Although uncommon, the presence of mixed infection in studies defining reinfection based on HCV genotype switch may result in a misclassification bias and overestimate the reinfection rate.

Several studies conducted interventions to reduce risk behaviours following treatment, such as education of safe injection and other preventions, peer-support, counselling, social support, and provision of sterile injecting equipment [22-25, 35, 37, 46, 49, 51, 52].

Given the wide heterogeneity between interventions, we were not able to assess the impact of these interventions on reinfection risk.

Although assessment of HCV reinfection requires having at least one post-treatment HCV assessment, several studies did not report or reported a relatively high proportion of people lost to follow-up.

It is possible that people lost to follow-up and not included in analyses had higher risk behaviours for HCV reinfection, leading to a potential risk of selection bias towards including people at lower risk of reinfection.

Lastly, it is also possible that there was a selection bias among people treated for HCV infection in these studies representing a less marginalized population, which would underestimate the rate of HCV reinfection.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, this study demonstrated that post-treatment HCV reinfection occurred, but the rate of reinfection in the DAA era was similar to rates observed in the interferon era.

Although the rate of reinfection was higher in people with recent injecting drug use, it was lower than rates of primary infection reported in the community.

Monitoring HCV reinfection following successful HCV treatment in people who inject drugs will be crucial to HCV elimination efforts.

Further studies are required to evaluate innovative strategies and models of care to enhance engagement in post-treatment care and prevent HCV reinfection among people who inject drugs.
