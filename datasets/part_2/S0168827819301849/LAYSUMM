TITLE

Macrophage p38α promotes nutritional steatohepatitis through M1 polarization

PARAGRAPH

p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases are important inflammatory factors.

In the present study, we demonstrated that p38α is upregulated in liver tissues of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases.

Genetic deletion of p38α in macrophages led to ameliorated nutritional steatohepatitis in mice through decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and increased M2 macrophage polarization.
