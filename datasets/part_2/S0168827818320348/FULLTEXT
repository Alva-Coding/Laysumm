TITLE

A combined model based on spleen stiffness measurement and Baveno VI criteria to rule out high-risk varices in advanced chronic liver disease

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

The increase of portal pressure above the threshold of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH, hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] ≥10 mmHg) is a landmark in the natural history of compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD).

Patients with CSPH are at risk of developing esophageal varices (EV) and clinical decompensation (variceal bleeding, ascites, jaundice, encephalopathy), which mark the transition from a compensated stage to a stage of the disease (decompensated) characterized by much higher mortality.1

In particular, variceal bleeding is still associated with 10–15% mortality despite the advances in its treatment.2

PARAGRAPH

Since the risk of variceal bleeding mostly depends upon the size of EV and can be reduced with appropriate medical or endoscopic treatment in patients with high-risk EV (HRV), endoscopic screening of EV is currently the standard of care in patients with cirrhosis.3

PARAGRAPH

Recommendations on the use of screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for the detection of HRV in all cirrhotic patients have been issued since the first Baveno consensus workshop in 1992.4

However, a large proportion of cirrhotic patients do not present with HRV, thus making endoscopy a non-ideal screening test that is associated with significant costs and patient discomfort.5

Accordingly, in the last decade, increased attention has been dedicated to identifying sufficiently accurate non-invasive tests (NITs) that can rule in and rule out CSPH and HRV, reducing or avoiding the use of invasive methods such as HVPG measurement and EGD.6,7

PARAGRAPH

The recent 2015 Baveno VI consensus workshop8 highlighted the diagnostic role of NITs such as liver stiffness measurement (LSM) in defining the presence of CSPH and HRV.

In particular, the so-called Baveno VI criteria useful in excluding HRV were defined as follows: patients with LSM <20 kPa (assessed by transient elastography [TE]) and a platelet count (PLT) >150,000/mm3 were considered very unlikely to have high-risk varices (<5%), and endoscopy could consequently be safely avoided.

The above criteria can also be applied for longitudinal follow-up, prompting screening endoscopy if LSM increases or PLT decreases.8

To date, several papers have provided validation of these criteria7,9–14 confirming that Baveno VI criteria correctly identify 98–100% of patients who could safely avoid endoscopy.

These criteria have recently also been adopted by the American Association for the Study of the Liver3 with a suggestion to use NIT stratification according to Baveno VI criteria in all patients with a new diagnosis of cirrhosis.

PARAGRAPH

A possible limitation of the Baveno VI criteria8 is related to a substantially low number of spared endoscopies (15–25%).9,10

Although different authors have tried to modify LSM and PLT cut-offs (25 kPa or 100,000–120,000/mm3), the rate of avoided EGDs did not exceed 30%.11,15

Therefore, most patients not presenting with HRVs still require endoscopy according to the Baveno criteria and it is becoming evident that more accurate non-invasive methodologies are needed to improve risk stratification.16

PARAGRAPH

In recent years, spleen stiffness measurement (SSM), carried out with various techniques (TE, acoustic radiation force impulse elastography [ARFI], 2D-shear wave elastography [2D-SWE] and magnetic resonance elastography [MRE]), has been proposed by several authors17,18 as an accurate diagnostic tool to assess CSPH and to predict EV presence or absence.

In a study performed by our group, SSM was more closely related to the severity of portal hypertension than LSM,19 thus allowing a more accurate prediction of clinical decompensation, as documented in a subsequent study.20

Furthermore, it has recently been observed that by using 2D-SWE the sequential use of LSM and SSM leads to an improvement of the non-invasive diagnosis of CSPH, compared to LSM alone21,22 and in combination with Lok-score to diagnose HRV.23

PARAGRAPH

The present study, performed in a cohort of patients with cACLD, aimed to: a) assess the performance of SSM in ruling out HRV and avoiding EGD; b) validate Baveno VI criteria in a large clinical practice setting, and c) assess whether the combined use of Baveno VI criteria and SSM can increase the number of safely avoided EGD.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Patients

PARAGRAPH

Patients with chronic liver diseases referred to the Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences of the University of Bologna (Italy) for liver disease severity staging were consecutive enrolled from 2012 to 2016.

The data collected, included LSM, SSM, laboratory tests and EGDs, were retrospectively analyzed.

From September 2017 to February 2018, patients with chronic liver diseases referred to our three centers (Bologna, Italy; Verona, Italy; Bern, Switzerland) were prospectively evaluated in order to externally validate the new combined model.

SECTION

Inclusion criteria

PARAGRAPH

The inclusion criteria of the retrospective cohort were: cACLD of any etiology with LSM ≥10 kPa according to Baveno VI criteria,8 availability of NITs (laboratory tests and SSM) and EGDs performed within three months of TE assessment.

In the prospective cohort, all patients with LSM >10 kPa were included.

If no EGD was available within three months prior to TE evaluation, they were subsequently evaluated with upper endoscopy.

SECTION

Exclusion criteria

PARAGRAPH

Exclusion criteria were the presence of decompensation events (ascites and hepatic encephalopathy), a previous episode of variceal bleeding and/or EV band ligation, current use of non-selective beta-blockers, portal vein thrombosis, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and non-cirrhotic portal hypertension.

In the retrospective cohort, a further exclusion criterion was ongoing antiviral treatment or treatment ending <6 months before the TE session; while in the prospective cohort, patients who had received direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment were always excluded.

SECTION

Liver and spleen stiffness measurements

PARAGRAPH

LSM values were assessed by expert operators, using the FibroScan® apparatus with “M” probe (Echosens, Paris, France) after overnight fasting and after a complete abdominal ultrasound (US) examination.

LSM values were obtained as previously reported19 and the reliability criteria considered were according to the last EFSUMB guidelines.24

At least 10 measurements with an IQR/M ≤30% were used as reliability criteria.

SSM was assessed on the same day as LSM assessment, with the same probe utilized to perform LSM using the FibroScan® apparatus, as previously described.19,20

SECTION

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopic examination

PARAGRAPH

A standard endoscopic examination was performed by third-level hospital expert operators.

The endoscopic findings were recorded and graded as follows: grade I: varices were flattened by insufflation; grade II: varices non-confluent and protruding in the lumen despite insufflation; grade III: confluent varices were not flattened by insufflation.

The presence of red signs was also recorded in all patients.

According to the criteria proposed at the Baveno VI Consensus Conference, HRV were defined as EV grade 1 with red signs or grade 2 or higher.8

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Statistical analyses were performed using Stata/SE (Version 14.2; Stata Corp, Texas, United States of America) for Windows; continuous variables are expressed as medians, and 25% and 75% percentiles; categorical data are expressed as numbers (percentages).

For multivariate model development, we used split-sample method.25

The derivation dataset consisted of 54 randomly selected cases (HRV) and 204 randomly selected controls (no HRV) from the original dataset of 100 cases and 398 controls; consequently, the internal validation dataset included 46 cases and 194 controls.

For group comparisons of categorical and continuous variables, Chi-square test or Mann-Whitney test and McNemar’s test were used, as appropriate.

Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed on the derivation dataset to evaluate the detection of HRV in cACLD.

Demographic, clinical, biochemical and elastometric variables were considered as risk variables.

LSM, PLTs and SSM were evaluated as continuous and dichotomous data: Baveno VI cut-off criteria8 were adopted for LSM and PLTs whereas, in order to rule out patients with HRV, the value corresponding to the negative likelihood ratio (LR−) closest to 0.05 was chosen for SSM cut-off.

Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted on variables that reached p <0.1 at univariate analysis.

The final multivariate logistic regression model was built from the set of candidate variables by removing predictors based on p values, in a stepwise manner.

Multicollinearity amongst variables was detected by means of Spearman correlation test.

For each multivariable logistic regression, the model discrimination and calibration were reported together with Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion measures for comparing maximum likelihood models.

Model discrimination was assessed calculating the AUROC curve (or c-statistic), whereas model calibration was determined by Hosmer-Lemeshow technique and the goodness-of-fit of the models was assessed by Akaike information criterion.

We made an a priori decision to consider only models with AUROC c-statistic ≥0.75 adequate.

To compare effects across nested logistic regression models the LR test was used; to test the equality of the AUCs, the DeLong test was performed.26

The final multivariable logistic models were fitted on an internal and external validation dataset and on the entire retrospective population.

In the multivariate model of the external validation cohort, the inter-center variability was taken into account.

In order to determine the relative importance of independent variables in the multivariable logistic regression, a “Dominance Analysis” was performed.27

Based on the multivariate logistic regression model with LSM, PLTs and SSM as continuous variables, a nomogram was drawn up.

Sensitivity, specificity, LR+ and LR− were calculated at each cut-off and also using an intention to diagnose principle (ITD),28 including non-evaluable results (SSM) either as “false negative” or as “false positive” according to the results of the reference standard (EGDs).

All p values refer to two-tailed tests of significance.

p <0.05 was considered significant.

Results

SECTION

Patient characteristics

PARAGRAPH

Over the study period, 643 cACLD patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria; 24 (3.7%) patients with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, 10 (1.6%) with portal/mesenteric/splenic vein thrombosis, 18 (2.8%) current users of non-selective beta-blockers, 10 (1.6%) with previous EV banding ligation and 83 (12.9%) with hepatic decompensated disease were excluded.

A total of 498 patients were finally included in the study cohort (Fig. 1); of these, 26 (5.2%) patients had an inadequate SSM.

PARAGRAPH

Two hundred and ninety-one (58.4%) out of 498 patients were male, the predominant etiology of the liver disease was related to HCV (n = 424, 85.1%).

Three hundred and fifty patients were Child-Pugh (CP) A (70.3%), 148 were CP-B (29.7%) and the median model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) value was 8 (7–10).

LSM median was 21.3 kPa (15–30.3) and median SSM was 54.3 kPa (40–67.8).

Two hundred and fifty-two (50.6%) out of 498 patients had EV and 100 of them had HRV (20.1%).

According to the split-sample method at baseline, the characteristics of the patients assigned to the derivation set (n = 258) and to the internal validation set (n = 240) were not statistically different (Table 1).

SECTION

Predictors of high-risk varices

PARAGRAPH

In the whole population, HRV were observed in 100 patients (20.1%), of whom 54 (20,8%) were in the derivation cohort and 46 (19%) in the internal validation cohort.

In the derivation cohort (Table 2), CP-B, MELD score, alanine aminotransferase levels, higher SSM values, higher LSM values, and lower platelet count were correlated with the presence of HRV and considered in the multivariate models.

PARAGRAPH

AUROC curves for LSM, platelets and SSM for the detection of HRV were 0.768 (95% CI 0.697–0.837), 0.717 (95% CI 0.664–0.784) and 0.847 (95% CI 0.795–0.898), respectively (Fig. S1).

PARAGRAPH

With the aim of identifying, by SSM ROC curves, the most accurate SSM cut-off to rule out patients with HRV (corresponding to a low probability [<5%] of HRV presence), a cut-off ≤46 kPa was chosen.

PARAGRAPH

At multivariate analysis of the derivation cohort, in model 1, CP-B, LSM <20 kPa, PLT >150,000/mm3 and SSM ≤46 kPa were significantly associated with HRV (Model 1 in Table 2).

To evaluate the contribution of SSM in predicting HRV, the multivariate analysis was performed to construct a second model including only CP-B, LSM <20 kPa and PLT >150,000/mm3 (Model 2 in Table 2).

LR Test between model 1 vs. 2 was χ2 = 20.89 (p value <0.00001).

Model 1 (with SSM) showed better discrimination (AUROC = 0.787) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p value = 0.342) parameters than model 2 (Table 2); according to the dominance analysis, SSM was the most important independent predictor for HRV (Table S4).

When these models were applied on the internal validation cohort and on the whole population, good calibration and discrimination of the models were confirmed (Table 3).

Furthermore, an individual estimation for HRV risk by nomogram, according to the multivariate logistic regression model on the derivation cohort population, was also performed (Fig. 2 and Table S1).

SECTION

Diagnostic performance of different NITs in ruling out HRV

PARAGRAPH

In the internal validation cohort, the performance of SSM (≤46 kPa) in ruling out HRV showed a sensitivity of 97.8%, a specificity of 43.8%, NPV of 98.8% and an LR− of 0.05.

SSM was significantly more accurate (AUROC comparison, De Long test p <0.0001) than Baveno VI (sensitivity 97.8%, specificity 26.3%, NPV 98.1%, LR− 0.08).

The combined model Baveno VI/SSM ≤46 was significantly more accurate than SSM or Baveno VI alone (AUROC comparison, p = 0.048 and p = 0.0001, respectively), showing sensitivity 95.7%, specificity 53.1%, NPV 98.1%, and LR− 0.08.

PARAGRAPH

Operator characteristics of the diagnostic tests and criteria under examination in the internal validation cohort (Table 4) as well as in the derivation and in the entire retrospective population cohorts (Table S2) are reported.

SECTION

SSM-based models and Baveno VI criteria in avoiding EGDs

PARAGRAPH

In the 240 evaluated patients belonging to the internal validation cohort, we tested the following models to exclude HRV, SSM (≤46 kPa) alone, Baveno VI criteria alone, and a new combined model Baveno VI/SSM ≤46.

SSM (≤46 kPa) alone demonstrated that endoscopy was avoidable in 86 patients (35.8%).

Within the group of patients with SSM ≤46 kPa, 15 patients presented EV (6.3%), of whom only one had HRV (2.2%).

Instead, 52 out of the 240 patients fulfilled the Baveno VI criteria and consequently could have avoided endoscopy (21.7%); among them, only one of the five patients with EV (2.1%) was misclassified as a non-HRV patient (2.2%).

A total of 154 patients with SSM >46 kPa and 188 patients who did not meet Baveno VI criteria would have undergone an endoscopy examination.

Ninety-eight percent of patients with HRV had undergone endoscopy according to SSM ≤46 kPa and Baveno VI criteria.

Comparing SSM ≤46 kPa and Baveno VI criteria, the proportion of avoided EGDs (35.8% vs. 21.7%) was significantly improved (p <0.0008) and the rates of misclassified HRV were 2.2% in both cases.

PARAGRAPH

By applying the SSM cut-off (≤46 kPa) for the detection of HRV in the internal validation cohort among the patients who did not fulfil Baveno VI criteria (n = 188), another 53 patients would have avoided endoscopy, reaching a total of 105 avoided endoscopies (43.8%).

Among the patients identified with the new combined model Baveno VI/SSM ≤46 who could have avoided endoscopy, 19 patients presented with EVs (7.9%), 2 of whom had HRVs (4.3%).

However, more than 98% of patients with HRV had undergone endoscopy examination.

A graphic representation of the above results in all cohorts considered is shown (Fig. S2).

The combination of these two diagnostic tests in a simple, sequential algorithm made it possible to avoid a further 22.1% of unnecessary EGDs if compared with Baveno VI criteria alone, thus reaching a final value of 43.8% of avoided endoscopies in the internal validation cohort (Fig. 3A).

Notably, among 52 patients avoiding endoscopy according to Baveno VI criteria, 33 had an SSM ≤46 kPa and 19 had an SSM >46 kPa.

Moreover, the rates of avoided EGDs of the evaluated diagnostic tests did not differ significantly (Table S2), both when Baveno VI criteria and SSM cut-off ≤46 were used alone or sequentially in the combined model, in the derivation cohort (19.4%, 32.2%, 40.7%, respectively) and in the entire retrospective population (20.3%, 33.9%, 42.2%, respectively) (Fig. 3).

The proportion of avoided endoscopies by using the new combined model Baveno VI/SSM ≤46 kPa was significantly higher than that of Baveno VI criteria (p = 0.0001) and SSM ≤46 kPa testing alone (p = 0.009).

SECTION

Validation of SSM-based models in prospective external validation cohort

PARAGRAPH

Two hundred and sixteen (216) patients were prospectively considered for enrolment in the external validation cohort.

Following the exclusion criteria, a total of 115 cACLD patients were included in the final prospective cohort, of whom 57 (49.6%) were enrolled from the Bologna center, 32 (27.8%) from Verona, and 26 (22.6%) from Bern.

SSM was unsuccessful in 15 (13%) patients (Fig. 1B).

PARAGRAPH

General characteristics of the external validation cohort are reported (Table 1).

HRV prevalence was 13%.

Etiology and aminotransferases values were the only variables that differed significantly compared to the entire retrospective cohort.

The accuracy of the multivariate Model 1 in the prediction of HRV in the external validation cohort is described (Table 3).

PARAGRAPH

The performance of the various NITs at ruling out HRV is reported (Table 4).

Applying Baveno VI criteria, 19 (16,5%) would have avoided EGD screening; none of them presented HRV.

Once again, by applying the SSM ≤46 cut-off, HRV was ruled out in an additional 24 patients, resulting in 43 (37.4%) patients being spared an EGD (no HRV missed) through the new combined model Baveno VI/SSM ≤46 (Fig. 3B).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Liver cirrhosis is generally characterized by a long phase of compensated disease; however, when decompensation occurs, the survival of these patients drastically decreases.1

Therefore, it becomes very important to achieve proper risk stratification in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis, and this should be particularly focused on identifying and staging portal hypertension and its main complications.1,4,29–31

Since gold-standard methods for portal hypertension and varices are invasive and expensive, there is increasing interest in the development of rapid and accurate NITs,6 LSM by TE in particular.6,8,20

PARAGRAPH

The results of the present study show that as well as CP-B and Baveno VI criteria variables (LSM and PLT), SSM performed by TE represents an accurate, non-invasive diagnostic tool in patients with cACLD for excluding the presence HRV.

In fact, SSM proved the most relevant independent predictor for HRV by multivariate analysis: the model including not only CP-B and Baveno VI variables but also SSM seems more appropriate to rule out patients with HRV and shows a significantly higher accuracy than a model without SSM (Table 2 and 3).

Accordingly, a highly usable tool represented by nomograms for the prediction of the individual absolute risk of HRV was drawn up (Fig. 2).

Furthermore, the sequential use of Baveno VI criteria and SSM in the combined model Baveno VI/SSM ≤46 allows for an important significant reduction in the number of unnecessary endoscopies compared to Baveno VI criteria alone.

PARAGRAPH

In the present study, SSM was the most accurate diagnostic tool for ruling out HRV patients (SSM AUROC = 0.847).

Even though SSM ≤46 kPa and Baveno VI criteria showed the same very high sensitivity (97.8%) with high NPV (98.1 vs. 98.8%) (Table 4), in the internal validation cohort as well as in the entire retrospective population, SSM had better specificity (26.3% vs. 43.8%).

PARAGRAPH

Using SSM as a single diagnostic test to rule out HRV with a single cut-off ≤46 kPa, the proportion of avoided endoscopies was 35.8%, significantly (p <0.01) higher than obtained by applying the Baveno VI criteria (21.7%).

Importantly, even if one HRV was missed by using Baveno VI criteria or the SSM model (≤46 kPa) alone, the number of HRV correctly detected was ≥95%.

The observed high diagnostic accuracy of SSM for HRV is not surprising, since we,19,20 others32,33 and two meta-analyses18,34 have already documented its excellent performance in the assessment of portal hypertension severity and in predicting the presence of EV and HRV in cirrhosis.

PARAGRAPH

Up to now, only one large study9 has validated Baveno VI criteria in 310 patients (23% with EV and 5% with HRV) with cACLD.

In this study, Baveno VI criteria were satisfied in 33% of the patients and HRV were missed in 2%.

The Baveno VI criteria were less frequently fulfilled in our study, with the criteria satisfied in 19.4%, 20.9%, and 16.5%, in the derivation, internal validation and external validation sets, respectively.

However, an excellent NPV was maintained, with 0%, 2.2%, and 0% of HRV missed in the derivation, internal validation and external validation sets, respectively.

The differences in the results might be explained by a higher proportion of varices in our studied population (50.6% EV and 20.1% HRV), likely as a consequence of more severe liver disease (a higher proportion of CP-B and a higher baseline LSM compared to Maurice et al.’s study9).

Nonetheless, the proportion of EV and HRV in our population is in line with what was previously observed in compensated cirrhosis,3,35–37 and the proportion of spared endoscopies is similar to that recently reported by a Spanish study in patients with cirrhosis of mostly viral etiology.38

PARAGRAPH

Several studies9–14,39 and one meta-analysis15 have validated Baveno VI criteria as safe for screening HRV in patients with cACLD, with <5% of HRV missed overall.

The proportion of spared EGDs with Baveno VI criteria is however relatively low (15–25%), as confirmed by our data (17–22%).

It should be considered that HRV prevalence in these different cohorts could have influenced the diagnostic performance of NITs.

Many authors have proposed different cut-offs and models to increase the number of EGDs that could be avoided.

The performance of these models in our entire retrospective cohort is shown (Table S3).

It appears that more permissive criteria would increase the number of avoided EGDs.

However, this would be at a lower rate than when using our SSM-based models and most importantly, with a rate of HRV missed above the accepted threshold of 5%.

PARAGRAPH

Since LSM is characterized by a poor correlation with the prediction of CSPH when employed for the detection of HVPG values >12 mmHg, probably owing to the increasing relevance of extra-hepatic factors in conditioning the progression of portal hypertension,40 SSM can better evaluate the progression of portal hypertension beyond this level, representing a more useful NIT in EV detection.19,34,41

PARAGRAPH

In accordance with these physiological hypotheses, we made a sequential algorithm (Fig. 4) which firstly evaluated HRV risk by Baveno VI criteria and subsequently according to the SSM cut-off (≤46 kPa).

PARAGRAPH

Interestingly, we observed that the sequential use of Baveno VI criteria and SSM in the new combined model Baveno VI/SSM ≤46 allows further improvement of the results obtained by both strategies alone (Table 4 and Table S2).

The application of this new sequential algorithm made it possible to increase the number of avoided unneeded endoscopies from 102 to 210, with a final proportion of 42.2% in the entire retrospective cohort, thus doubling the proportion obtained by Baveno VI criteria alone (Fig. 3).

It should be noted that the risk of missing HRV by applying our combined model was acceptable (<5%), according to Baveno VI consensus.8

PARAGRAPH

In addition to the internal validation by the split-sample method, our combined model Baveno VI/SSM ≤46 kPa was also validated externally in a prospective multicenter cohort of 115 patients with cACLD and an HRV prevalence of 13% (Table 1).

The combined model maintained a superior performance in ruling out HRV, safely sparing 37.4% of EGDs (0 HRV missed), in comparison to 16.5% of EGDs that would have safely been avoided by applying only the Baveno VI criteria (Fig. 3 and Table 4).

PARAGRAPH

In our opinion, SSM ≤46 kPa is clearly able to stratify patients for HRV risk better than Baveno VI criteria does.

In addition, the combined use of LSM and SSM as an initial HRV screening strategy in the cACLD population is a more attractive strategy that might avoid misclassification of patients at high risk, despite relatively low LSM or normal PLT values.

PARAGRAPH

Our study has some limitations.

One of the main problems of SSM is the rate of unsuccessful examination (15–20%).42

Thus, in order to reduce this rate, we performed an US-guided examination, as previously described,19,20 improving the feasibility of SSM (87–94%).

A dedicated SSM-TE device with a built-in US probe for spleen detecting would be desirable.

In addition, inclusion of unsuccessful SSM did not negatively influence the performance of models by the ITD approach as reported in the Results section.

PARAGRAPH

Moreover, the rate of spared EGDs did not improve significantly adding Baveno VI criteria to the model including SSM ≤46 kPa alone in the prospective cohort, unlike what was previously shown in the larger retrospective cohort.

Therefore, sample size could play a role in the ability to detect a significant improvement when combining the two models.

Moreover, we believe that LSM is demanded for the non-invasive assessment of patients with cACLD, and therefore a key point in the newly proposed sequential algorithm.

PARAGRAPH

Another limitation of the study was the possible influence of any antiviral treatment on the elastography measurement.24

However, since the availability, and consequently the efficacy, of antiviral treatments were different in the two studied cohorts (mostly interferon in the retrospective cohort, and DAAs in the prospective cohort), antiviral treatment with DAAs was considered as an exclusion criterion.

PARAGRAPH

Finally, this study did not include patients in whom LSM and SSM were assessed by other US elastosonographic techniques.

Nevertheless, TE is still considered the best validated and most available elastography technique,24 and most centers use TE as the only technique to assess liver and spleen stiffness.

Our study has the major strength of including a prospective external multicenter validation cohort of patients who confirmed the results of the retrospective cohort.

We also enrolled a large number of well characterized, compensated patients.

Another important strength of our study is that we propose both a new, simple sequential algorithm-based on binary, easy to remember cut-offs (Fig. 4), and a readily available tool, namely nomograms, based on the continuous modelling of risk of HRV by SSM (Fig. 2).

The latter makes it possible to avoid losing potentially relevant information and aims at individualizing care, thus potentially leading to better decisions in individual situations.7

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, our study indicates that SSM combined with Baveno VI criteria in a simple sequential algorithm is an accurate and non-invasive test for ruling out HRV and safely avoiding a much larger proportion of unnecessary endoscopies than Baveno VI criteria alone.

At the same time SSM is also a strong independent predictor of the presence of HRV.
