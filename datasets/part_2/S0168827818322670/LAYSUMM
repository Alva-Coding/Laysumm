TITLE

An internet-based approach for lifestyle changes in patients with NAFLD: Two-year effects on weight loss and surrogate markers

PARAGRAPH

In patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, participation in structured lifestyle programs may be jeopardized by job and time constraints.

A web-based intervention may be better suited for young, busy patients, and for those living far from liver units.

The study shows that, following a structured motivational approach, a web-based, interactive intervention coupled with six-month face-to-face meetings is not inferior to a standard group-based intervention with respect to weight loss, adherence to healthy diet and habitual physical activity, normalization of liver enzymes, and stable surrogate markers of fibrosis.
