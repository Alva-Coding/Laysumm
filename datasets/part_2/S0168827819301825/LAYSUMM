TITLE

KLRG1+ natural killer cells exert a novel antifibrotic function in chronic hepatitis B

PARAGRAPH

Individuals that are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) possess an increased number of immune cells, called natural killer (NK) cells expressing the surface marker KLRG1 in the blood and liver.

Here, we demonstrate that these specific NK cells are able to kill activated stellate cells in the liver.

Because activated stellate cells contribute to liver scarring, i.e. fibrosis, and subsequent liver dysfunction in individuals with chronic HBV infection, KLRG1+ NK cells are a novel immune cell type that can limit liver scarring.
