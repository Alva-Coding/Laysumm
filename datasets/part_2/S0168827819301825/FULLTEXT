TITLE

KLRG1+ natural killer cells exert a novel antifibrotic function in chronic hepatitis B

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Natural killer (NK) cells are a primary effector population responsible for the innate immune response to viral infection, representing approximately 5–15% of blood and 40–60% of hepatic lymphocytes.1,2

While NK cells play a role in controlling hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection,3–9 they act as a double-edged sword, contributing to liver injury through sustained activation and tissue damage.10–13

PARAGRAPH

In humans, NK cells are historically divided into 2 subsets according to the expression of CD56: CD56dim NK cells represent approximately 90% of circulating NK cells and demonstrate strong cytolytic capacity, whereas CD56bright NK cells constitute the remaining 10% of NK cells and are strong producers of cytokines.14,15

With shorter telomeres and later appearance following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation,16,17 CD56dim cells are considered further differentiated than CD56bright NK cells.

They can nonetheless continue to differentiate, losing NKG2A and acquiring CD16, killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), CD57, and killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1) surface markers that appear sequentially during NK cell maturation.18–22

PARAGRAPH

KLRG1 is an inhibitory receptor of the C-type lectin-like family.23

Approximately 20% of human CD4+ T cells and 40% of CD8+ T cells express KLRG1, most of which are effector or memory T cells.24

KLRG1 expressing cells possess poor proliferative capacity indicative of senescence, but still maintain their ability to exert effector functions.24–26

During persistent viral infections such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV),27,28 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),29 and Epstein-Barr virus infection,26,30,31 the proportion of KLRG1+ T cells increases in peripheral blood.

The interaction of KLRG1 with its ligand, E-cadherin, results in inhibition of cytotoxic activity, suggesting that KLRG1 may raise the activation threshold of T cells.32–35

As a result, KLRG1 may limit the antiviral activity of T cells, thus contributing to viral persistence.36

Unlike T cells, the role of KLRG1 on NK cells remains uncertain, particularly in chronic HBV infection.

PARAGRAPH

In this study, we examined the quantity, phenotype and functional characteristics of KLRG1+ NK cells in healthy controls and patients with chronic HBV (CHB).

Patients with CHB had a significantly higher frequency of mature KLRG1+ NK cells than healthy controls.

These mature KLRG1+ NK cells rely on antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) as a distinct effector mechanism.

Moreover, peripheral blood KLRG1+ NK cells are negatively correlated with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels and enriched in patients with CHB and no or mild fibrosis, suggesting a role of KLRG1+ NK cells in limiting liver injury and fibrosis.

Consequently, KLRG1+ NK cells may play an important part in controlling the progression of liver disease during CHB infection.

PARAGRAPH

The LX-2 immortalized human hepatic stellate cell (HSC) line was cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium containing 10% FCS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin.

Progressive activation of LX-2 cells in culture was confirmed by the increase in mRNA expression of the ACTA2 gene that encodes for α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) protein, quantified by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) during different time points (Fig. S1).

NK cells (±IFN-α pre-activation) were co-cultured with LX-2 cells at the effector target ratio (E:T) of 10:1 for 6 h and IFN-γ and degranulation were measured as above.

SECTION

Apoptosis assay

PARAGRAPH

To differentiate NK cells from HSCs for flow analysis, LX-2 and primary human HSCs (hHSCs) (SciencCell, USA) were stained with 5 μM carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE, Cayman Chemicals) for 10 min at room temperature and washed, before 5 × 104 cells/well were seeded in a 24-well plate.

IFN-α stimulated CD3-CD56dimCD16brightKLRG1−and CD3-CD56dimCD16brightKLRG1+ NK cells were co-incubated with HSCs for 6 h at an E:T ratio of 1:1 ± the neutralizing tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) antibody (clone RIK-2; 10 µg/ml; Biolegend).

LX-2 and primary hHSCs were harvested, and apoptosis studied by staining with propidium iodide and annexin V conjugated to allophycocyanin (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

Results

SECTION

KLRG1+ NK cells frequency is elevated in CHB patients

PARAGRAPH

To examine the effect of CHB infection on circulating NK cells, blood NK cells were phenotyped based on KLRG1 expression by flow cytometry.

NK cell frequencies were not significantly different between healthy controls (n = 10) and patients with CHB (n = 33) (Fig. 1A), however, a larger population of KLRG1+ NK cells were present in patients with CHB (13.4 vs. 2.3%, p <0.0001, Fig. 1B).

The phenotype of KLRG1+ NK cells was similar in healthy controls and patients with CHB (Fig. S2).

Compared to CD56bright NK cells, KLRG1 was highly expressed on CD56dim NK cells (13.2 vs. 0.1%, p <0.0001, Fig. 1B), supporting its role as a maturation marker.

To confirm the larger percentage of KLRG1+ NK cells in patients with CHB compared to healthy controls, we utilized an unbiased analysis of non-linear dimensionality reduction approach via t-stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE).

As presented in the 2D t-SNE plot in Fig. 1C, there was a markedly different distribution of NK cells within the CHB CD56dim area when compared to healthy control samples.

We further found that the KLRG1 marker was highly expressed in this area within CHB samples (Fig. 1C), confirming our findings using manual gating.

Furthermore, a larger population of CD16+ cells was present in the KLRG1+ population (80.8 vs. 76%, p <0.01, Fig. 1D) that additionally expressed higher levels of CD16 as represented by geometric mean fluorescence intensity (gMFI) (4,812.1 vs. 4,337.3, p <0.001, Fig. 1D).

A significant upregulation of the FCGR3A gene encoding CD16 (2.14 vs. 1.4-fold change; p <0.01, Fig. 1D) on KLRG1+ was confirmed by qPCR.

PARAGRAPH

We next investigated differences in maturation stage by studying CD57 and KIR, both of which reflect the mature phenotype of CD56dimCD16bright NK cells (Fig. 2A).22

A greater frequency of CD57 positive cells (79.2 vs. 74.6%, p <0.05, Fig. 2B) and gMFI (9,851 vs. 5,425.5, p <0.01, Fig. 2B) were measured on KLRG1+ than KLRG1− NK cells, with minimal differences in KIR expression between subsets (Fig. 2B).

We also investigated the expression of NK cell activating and inhibitory receptors (NKp46, DNAM-1, and NKG2A) on KLRG1+ and KLRG1− NK cells.

Consistent with previous reports,18,22 we found NKp46 and NKG2A were expressed at a lower frequency and density (gMFI) on the surface of KLRG1+ compared with KLRG1− NK cells (NKp46; 38.8% vs. 50.3%, p <0.0001 and gMFI 337.6 vs. 355, p <0.05, Fig. 2B; NKG2A; 2.3% vs. 7.2%, p <0.0001 and gMFI 558.9 vs. 561.7, p <0.01, Fig. 2B).

The expression level of DNAM-1 (CD226) was significantly higher in frequency (77.6% vs. 74.2%, p <0.05, Fig. 2B) and gMFI (1,454.5 vs. 1,240.4, p <0.01, Fig. 2B) on KLRG1+ compared to KLRG1− NK cells.

In contrast to chronic HCMV infection,28,39–42 there was no difference in the frequency (18.2 vs. 21%, p > 0.05, Fig. 2B) and gMFI (916.1 vs. 980.9, p > 0.05, Fig. 2B) of NKG2C expression on NK cell populations.

Representative flow analysis of KLRG1+ and KLRG1− NK cell surface markers are shown in Fig. S3.

NK cell receptor expression was confirmed by qPCR, demonstrating a 1.8-fold increase in CD57 (B3GAT1) (p <0.05), 3.6-fold reduction in NKp46 (NCR1) (p <0.05), 2.1-fold reduction in NKG2A (KLRC1) (p <0.01), and 2-fold increase in DNAM-1 (CD226) (p <0.01, Fig. 2C) mRNA expression in KLRG1+ versus KLRG1− NK cells.

SECTION

KLRG1+ NK cells possess superior antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity

PARAGRAPH

To assess NK cell function in relation to KLRG1 expression, IFN-γ production and degranulation were examined following cytokine treatment and target cell co-culture.

While no differences in IFN-γ expression were observed following IL-12/15 stimulation, IL-12/18 stimulation resulted in fewer IFN-γ producing KLRG1+ NK cells compared to KLRG1− NK cells (9.5 vs. 14.9%, p <0.001, Fig. 3A).

Consistent with flow cytometry results, KLRG1+ NK cell IFNG expression was reduced following IL-12/18 treatment compared to KLRG1− NK cells (2.0 vs. 4.5-fold change; p <0.05, Fig. 3A).

PARAGRAPH

KLRG1+ NK cell activation in response to the K562 target cell co-culture was also diminished compared to KLRG1− cells.

IFN-γ production was reduced in KLRG1+ NK cells (0.9 vs. 2.8%, p <0.05, Fig. 3B), as was degranulation, measured using CD107a (12.2 vs. 14.4, p <0.01, Fig. 3B).

qPCR results confirmed these findings, demonstrating reduced KLRG1+ NK cell IFNG (0.7 vs. 1.6-fold change, p <0.05, Fig. 3B) and GZMB (1.1 vs. 2.0-fold change, p <0.05, Fig. 3B) expression after K562 challenge.

As in patients with CHB, KLRG1+ NK cells from healthy controls showed reduced effector activities following stimulation with cytokines and target cells (Fig. S4).

These data suggest that KLRG1+ NK cells have reduced functionality towards standard stimuli, akin to reduced cytokine sensitivity that has been documented in highly differentiated NK cells.22,43

PARAGRAPH

KLRG1+ NK cell activation can additionally occur through CD16 recognition of antibody bound antigen, called the ADCC pathway.44

To evaluate the capacity for ADCC by KLRG1+ NK cells, PBMCs from patients with CHB were co-cultured with CD20-expressing Raji cells ± the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab.

In contrast to our previous findings, KLRG1+ NK cells showed increased IFN-γ production (8.0 vs. 1.5%, p <0.05, Fig. 3C) and degranulation (9.0 vs. 4.8%, p <0.05, Fig. 3C) following stimulation with anti-CD20+ Raji cells compared to KLRG1− NK cells.

KLRG1+ NK cells additionally demonstrated a 1.8-fold increase in IFNG (p <0.05) and a 2.9-fold increase in GZMB expression (p <0.05, Fig. 3C) compared to KLRG1− NK cells.

SECTION

KLRG1 is upregulated on FcεRIγ-negative NK cells

PARAGRAPH

Considering that effective ADCC is a hallmark of FcεRIγ-negative NK cells (g-NK cells or gamma-negative NK cells), we examined KLRG1 expression in this context.

We gated on CD56dim NK cells to identify FcεRIγ-negative and FcεRIγ-positive NK cells45–48 and analysed KLRG1 expression in these subsets (Fig. 4A).

Our results showed the expression of KLRG1 was significantly increased on FcεRIγ-negative NK cells compared to FcεRIγ-positive NK cells (16.6 vs. 11.9%, p <0.01, Fig. 4A).

To verify whether KLRG1+ NK cells belong to the group FcεRIγ-negative NK cells in general, we performed qPCR on sorted KLRG1+ and KLRG1− NK cells for genes that are known to be related to FcεRIγ-negative NK cells.

Indeed, KLRG1+ NK cells had significantly lower expression of FCER1G mRNA encoding for FcεRIγ (1.6 vs. 3.7-fold change, p <0.01, Fig. 4B).

In addition, the KLRG1+ NK cells showed decreased expression of genes typically decreased in FcεRIγ-negative NK cells,48 for example signalling molecules SYK (0.4 vs. 1.34, p <0.01, Fig. 4B), DAB2 (1 vs. 2.1, p <0.05, Fig. 4B) and transcriptional regulators PLZF (0.8 vs. 1.6, p <0.05, Fig. 4B) and IKZF2 (1.5 vs. 1.9, p <0.05, Fig. 4B).

PARAGRAPH

Given the strong association between HCMV infection and the presence of FcεRIγ-negative NK cells,46 we further investigated whether the KLRG1+ NK cells persist in patients with CHB based on HCMV exposure.

We tested IgG HCMV antibody titres and found no significant difference in KLRG1 expression based on HCMV serology status either in healthy controls or patients with CHB (Fig. S6).

This indicates that increased frequency of KLRG1+ NK cells was likely due to HBV infection, and not CMV exposure.

SECTION

Chronic hepatitis B infection stimulates the expression of NK cell KLRG1

PARAGRAPH

To examine whether the expression of KLRG1 is induced by persistent antigen stimulation, we cultured NK cells from healthy controls for 7 days with either (1) CHB serum (HBsAg (+) and ALT level <60 IU/ml), (2) NAFLD serum (HBsAg (−) and ALT level <60 IU/ml), or (3) FCS as a control.

CHB serum had no effect on CD56dim NK cell CD16, CD57, or KIR, but stimulated KLRG1 surface expression (CHB vs. FCS; 4.1 vs. 0.9%, p <0.01 and gMFI: 2,042.5 vs. 1,685, p <0.05, CHB vs. NALFD; 4.1 vs. 0.5%, p <0.01 and gMFI: 2,042.5 vs. 1,602.3, p <0.05, Fig. 5A).

Indeed, CHB serum stimulated an activated NK cell phenotype, increasing the frequency of CD69 positive cells compared to FCS controls (9.2 vs. 1.1%, p <0.01 and gMFI: 1,508.8 vs. 1,123.3, p <0.05, Fig. 5A).

Representative flow dot plots are shown in Fig. S6.

PARAGRAPH

Furthermore, there was no significant difference in KLRG1+ NK cells after culture with HBV serum from HBeAg positive or negative patients (Fig. 5B).

Additionally, the percentage of KLRG1+ NK cells within patients with CHB in the presence or absence of HBeAg was similar (Fig. 5C) and no correlation was found between the percentage of KLRG1+ NK cells and HBsAg concentration (Fig. 5C).

However, a significant increase in KLRG1 expression was observed in PBMCs stimulated with purified HBsAg (p <0.05) or serum from a patient with acute HBV for 7 days, compared to PBMCs cultured with FCS or NAFLD serum (Fig. 5D), suggesting that antigen stimulation is required for induction of KLRG1 expression.

A similar pattern of KLRG1 expression on CD8+ T cells has been observed during persistent antigen stimulation in chronic viral infection.30,31

SECTION

Peripheral KLRG1+ NK cells are activated and correlate negatively with liver injury serum markers

PARAGRAPH

CD69 expression levels were measured to determine the activation state of CD56dimCD16bright NK cells in relation to KLRG1 expression: The frequency of the activation marker CD69 was significantly higher on KLRG1+ NK cells than KLRG1− NK cells in patients with CHB (14.6 vs. 6.6%, p <0.0001 and gMFI: 1,385.6 vs. 1,154.2, p <0.0001, Fig. 6A).

This was confirmed by qPCR, showing an increase in CD69 mRNA expression on KLRG1+ NK cells (3.4 vs. 1.7-fold change; p <0.05, Fig. 6A).

PARAGRAPH

Peripheral KLRG1+ NK cells in patients with CHB showed a negative correlation with levels of ALT (r: −0.538, p = 0.0012, Fig. 6B) and AST (r: −0.542, p = 0.0011, Fig. 6B).

Additionally, we found peripheral and intrahepatic KLRG1+ NK cells are enriched in patients with CHB and no or mild fibrosis stage (F0-F1) compared to moderate fibrosis stages (F2-F3), as assessed by liver biopsy or transient elastography (Fibroscan) (peripheral: 14.8 vs. 7%, p <0.05; intrahepatic: 38.8 vs. 8%, p <0.05, Fig. 6C)

SECTION

Hepatic KLRG1+ NK cells are enriched in the livers of chronic hepatitis B patients

PARAGRAPH

To better understand the relationship between KLRG1+ NK cells in peripheral blood and liver, we performed phenotyping of hepatic NK cells from liver resections from 13 patients undergoing surgery for colorectal metastases or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): 8 patients were HBsAg (+), anti-HBc (+), anti-HBs (−) and 5 patients were HBsAg (−), anti-HBc (−), anti-HBs (−).

We observed NK cells were slightly enriched in liver compared to peripheral blood both in healthy controls and patients with CHB (Fig. 7A).

KLRG1+ NK cells were significantly enriched in liver of patients with CHB compared to non-CHB controls (23.4 vs. 2.6%, p <0.01, Fig. 7A).

PARAGRAPH

These findings prompted us to further characterize whether KLRG1+ NK cells were liver-resident NK cells.

Because the expression of CD69 is high on liver-resident NK cells49,50 and correlates with other liver-resident NK cells markers such as CXCR6 and CD49a,49,51–53 we investigated KLRG1 expression based on CD69 positivity on intrahepatic NK cells subsets.

Using t-SNE plots, we identified distinct CD69+ and CD69− NK cell populations (Fig. 7B), and further, that CXCR6 and CD49a markers were highly expressed on CD69+ NK cells (Fig. 7C).

These findings are in line with previous publications53,54 that identified CD69 as a tissue retention marker.

PARAGRAPH

Additionally, KLRG1 was highly expressed in CD69− compared to CD69+ NK cells, as measured by gMFI (723.8 vs. 566.8, p <0.05, Fig. 7C).

Mature NK cell characteristics such as lower CD56 expression and higher CD16 and CD57 expression were found in the CD69− NK cell subset (Fig. 7C).

Altogether, these findings suggest that intrahepatic KLRG1+ NK cells were not liver-resident NK cells, but more closely resemble the peripheral KLRG1+ NK cell phenotype.

PARAGRAPH

Finally, to investigate the activation state of intrahepatic KLRG1+ NK cells, we compared the expression of NKp44 activating receptor within CD69− and CD69+ NK cell subsets.

Unlike the other natural cytotoxicity receptors, NKp30 and NKp46, which are constitutively expressed, NKp44 is only expressed after NK cell activation.55,56

The expression of NKp44 was significantly higher on KLRG1+ NK cells compared to KLRG1− NK cells, as measured by gMFI (228.6 vs. 126.3, p <0.05, Fig. 7C).

SECTION

Antifibrotic activity of KLRG1+ NK cells

PARAGRAPH

To assess whether KLRG1+ NK cells possess antifibrotic activity, we examined their ability to kill activated stellate cells.

IFN-α was used to stimulate NK cells, as it has been extensively used to treat chronic HBV and limit the progression of liver fibrosis.57,58

NK cells were sorted based on KLRG1 expression and treated ± 1,000 U/ml IFN-α for 14 h. Following co-culture with LX-2 cells for 6 h, KLRG1+ NK cell IFN-γ production was significantly increased compared to KLRG1− cells in the absence (3 vs. 0.3%, p <0.05, Fig. 8A) or presence (6.1 vs. 1%, p <0.01, Fig. 8A) of IFN-α stimulation.

Consistent with IFN-γ production, KLRG1+ NK cells demonstrated stronger cytotoxicity than KLRG1− NK cells against LX-2 cells after IFN-α stimulation (26.9 vs. 13.3%, p <0.01, Fig. 8A).

To validate these findings, NK cells were sorted based on KLRG1 expression and treated ± IFN-α.

IFNG and GZMB mRNA expression was significantly increased on KLRG1+ compared to KLRG1− NK cells following LX-2 co-culture in the absence (IFNG: 3.1 vs. 1.2; GZMB: 3.2 vs. 2.2, p <0.05, Fig. 8B) or presence (IFNG: 4.4 vs. 2.3; GZMB: 4.2 vs. 1.9, p <0.05, Fig. 8B) of IFN-α treatment.

PARAGRAPH

Apart from granzyme/perforin-dependent and IFN-γ-mediated mechanisms, NK cells can limit fibrosis progression via TRAIL-, FasL-, or NKG2D- interactions with activated HSC receptors.59

To determine whether KLRG1+ NK cells can induce LX-2 cell death via these mechanisms, we performed phenotypic analysis of TRAIL, FasL, and NKG2D expression on CD56dimCD16brightKLRG1+ and KLRG1− NK cells in the presence, or absence, of IFN-α.

TRAIL expression alone was significantly upregulated on KLRG1+ NK cells compared to KLRG1− NK cells (13.5 vs. 9.2%, p <0.01, Fig. 8C) following IFN-α stimulation.

Consistently, a significant increase in TRAIL (TNFSF10) mRNA in KLRG1+ NK cells was measured following IFN-α treatment (1.9-fold increase, p <0.05, Fig. 8C).

TRAIL receptor expression on LX-2 cells was assessed by qPCR for 7 days after plating, demonstrating maximal expression on day 7, consistent with increased activation status (Fig. S1).

Consistent with IFN-γ and cytotoxicity assays, KLRG1+ NK cells were more effective at inducing apoptosis of LX-2 cells (Annexin V+) compared to KLRG1-NK cells (10.6 vs. 0.4%, p <0.01, Fig. 8D).

The apoptotic role of TRAIL was confirmed in blocking experiments, where pre-incubation with a neutralizing TRAIL antibody significantly decreased LX-2 apoptosis in KLRG1+ NK cells (10.6 vs. 2.2%, p <0.01, Fig. 8D), but not in KLRG1− NK cells.

PARAGRAPH

To confirm the antifibrotic function of KLRG1+ NK cells with activated HSCs, we used primary hHSCs that more closely resemble in vivo activated HSCs.

A progressive increase of hHSC TRAIL-R2 (DR5) mRNA expression was observed in parallel with progressive hHSC activation after plating (Fig. S1).

Similar to their ability to kill LX-2 cells, KLRG1+ NK cells killed primary hHSCs more effectively than KLRG1− NK cells (16.1 vs. 10.8%, p <0.01, Fig. 8D), and blocking TRAIL with a neutralizing antibody significantly reduced the TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by KLRG1+ NK cells (16.1 vs. 10.7%, p <0.01, Fig. 8D), but not by KLRG1− NK cells.

Taken together, this shows a mechanism by which KLRG1+ NK cells may limit liver fibrosis by killing activated HSCs.

PARAGRAPH

HSC-derived osteopontin (OPN) has recently been associated with the promotion of HSC activation, collagen deposition and fibrogenesis.60–64

Along with HSC activation, increased concentrations of OPN were detected in the supernatant of LX-2 cultures (Fig. S1).

To determine whether KLRG1+ NK cells potentially interact with OPN, we examined the surface expression of OPN receptors CD44 and VLA-4 on NK cells, and found that CD44 only was highly expressed on KLRG1+ NK cells compared to KLRG1− NK cells (19,398.1 vs. 12,784.2, p <0.01, Fig. 8E).

To confirm whether the antifibrotic effect of KLRG1+ NK cells is mediated by osteopontin, NK cells were incubated with 1 µg/ml of recombinant OPN after which NK cell activation status was measured: IFN-γ secretion and degranulation were significantly increased in KLRG1+ NK cells compared to KLRG1− NK cells (IFN-γ; 3.6 vs. 1.2, p <0.01; CD107a; 37.5 vs. 31.9%, p <0.01, Fig. 8F) supporting an antifibrotic effect.

These findings suggest that activation of KLRG1+ NK cells can be mediated by OPN, which is produced by activated HSCs, and thus reduce liver fibrosis.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

HBV infection remains a major public health concern, with more than 257 million people chronically infected and at high risk of developing liver failure, cirrhosis, and HCC.65

The mechanism of HBV chronicity remains ill-defined but involves a complex interaction between viral immune suppression and the host immune response.

Because NK cells play an important role in the early stages of host defence against viral infection, an impaired NK cell response may contribute to viral persistence in HBV infection.4,66–67

Unfortunately, the NK cell response that drives viral clearance also contributes to liver injury and subsequent fibrosis in CHB.10,12,68–70

Nonetheless, emerging evidence suggests that NK cell populations in the liver can have antifibrotic activities by killing activated HSCs, or via the production of the antifibrogenic cytokine, IFN-γ.57,59,71–78

PARAGRAPH

Recent studies in mice and humans have demonstrated the presence of significant heterogeneity among NK cells based on maturation stage and functional capability,19,79–81 making it unclear which NK cell population possesses antifibrotic potential.

We have demonstrated that KLRG1+ NK cells can potentially inhibit liver fibrosis by targeting activated stellate cells in a TRAIL-dependent manner.

Furthermore, we have established a link between KLRG1+ NK cells in the regulation of liver fibrosis, as well as the protection against liver injury, a common precursor of liver fibrosis.

Therefore, the production of KLRG1+ NK cells in patients with CHB may offer advantageous clinical effects for treating liver fibrosis.

PARAGRAPH

The effect of KLRG1 expression on NK cells and their biological role in chronic HBV infection remains unknown.

We have shown a significant increase in KLRG1+ NK cells in patients with CHB compared to healthy donors.

KLRG1 expression is elevated on CD56dim NK cells and is co-expressed with CD16 and CD57 surface markers, indicative of NK cell maturity.

This mature state relates to the reduced IFN-γ and cytotoxic responses to cytokine stimulation22,43 and target cell co-culture that we observed,82–86 as well as to the elevated ADCC immune responses by recognition of antibody-coated target cells (Fig. 3).46,84,87.

Moreover, we found that KLRG1 was highly expressed on FcεRIγ-NK cells that expand during HCMV or chronic HBV/HCMV co-infection and represent memory-like NK cells.46,88

While KLRG1+ NK cells share similar expression of maturation markers (↑CD57), signalling molecules (↓Syk, ↓DAB2), and transcription factors (↓PLZF, ↓Helios) with FcεRIγ-NK cells, we found that KLRG1 is upregulated on NK cells of patients with CHB regardless of HCMV serology status (Fig. S5).

In addition, we found no correlation between KLRG1+ NK cells with NK cells subsets that expand during HCMV infection (KIR+CD57+NKG2C+)89 (Fig. S5).

These findings suggest that the presence of KLRG1+ NK cells in patients with CHB is not affected by the presence of HCMV infection.

PARAGRAPH

In HBV infection, NK cell cytolytic activity is positively correlated with liver injury, as measured by ALT or AST levels and liver histological activity index.10,12

We found a negative correlation between the gMFI of KLRG1 on NK cells and serum ALT/AST levels suggesting an opposite effect.

The low cytotoxicity of KLRG1+ NK cells may be mediated by the inhibitory function of KLRG1 that prevents hepatocyte lysis by binding to its biological ligand E-cadherin on hepatocytes.90

Additionally, it may be mediated by the low expression of NKp46 activating receptor, which plays a significant role in regulating NK cell cytotoxicity during HBV infection.

Indeed, the abundance of NKp46+ NK cells correlates with NK cytotoxicity in several viral infections71,91,92 and blocking NKp46 reduces NK cytotoxicity against HepG2 cell lines.91,93,94

PARAGRAPH

Our finding that KLRG1+ NK cells can stimulate HSC apoptosis indicates that they may represent a unique NK cell population with antifibrotic potential.

These findings are in line with published works showing inhibition of HSC proliferation, activation and induction of HSC apoptosis via NK cell IFN-γ production and cytotoxicity.71–73

Although KLRG1+ NK cells lack NKp46 receptor expression which has previously been shown to play a role to in liver fibrosis,71 the loss of E-cadherin, the ligand for KLRG1, on activated HSCs (Fig. S1) could mediate the activation of KLRG1+ NK cells via the reduction of inhibitory signals in the regulation of NK cell activity.

In addition, IFN-α enhanced NK cell activation and attenuation of liver fibrosis progression have been reported in patients with HCV95,96 and HBV,57,58 prompting our examination of its effects (Fig. 8).

Our results demonstrate that IFN-α stimulates TRAIL-mediated HSC killing by KLRG1+ NK cells in vitro, indicating that IFN-α may not only be beneficial for inhibiting viral replication in patients with HBV, but also in limiting liver fibrosis progression by activating KLRG1+ NK cells.

Finally, we found that KLRG1+ NK cells can be activated by OPN, which is produced by activated HSCs, suggesting a novel antifibrotic role for KLRG1+ NK cells.

PARAGRAPH

The stimulus required to induce the production of KLRG1+ NK cells remains uncertain; however, we have demonstrated that HBV antigen is likely required.

By culturing NK cells from healthy donors with serum from patients with CHB and NAFLD with similar ALT (<60 IU/ml) or recombinant HBV antigen, we found that KLRG1 expression is induced in the presence of HBV antigen alone.

These data suggest that an antigenic stimulus, as is present in the HBV vaccine or during active infection, is capable of stimulating KLRG1+ NK cell maturation.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, we have shown that KLRG1+ NK cells persist in the blood and liver of patients with CHB, where they display a mature phenotype.

Their inability to produce IFN-γ after cytokine stimulation and limited cytotoxic activity are consistent with their differentiated status.

KLRG1+ NK cells are however more responsive to ADCC stimulus and display a greater capacity to induce HSC apoptosis, perhaps explaining their enrichment in patients with no or mild fibrosis.

A better understanding of the factors that influence KLRG1 expression, NK cell maturation, and the antifibrotic activity of KLRG1+ NK cells may provide insight into novel therapeutic strategies to limit fibrosis in CHB.
