TITLE

AXIN deficiency in human and mouse hepatocytes induces hepatocellular carcinoma in the absence of β-catenin activation

PARAGRAPH

Liver cancer has a poor prognosis.

Defining the molecular pathways involved is important for developing new therapeutic approaches.

The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is the most frequently deregulated pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Mutations of AXIN1, a member of this pathway, represent about 10% of HCC mutations.

Using both human HCC collections and engineered mouse models of liver cancers with AXIN1 mutation or deletion, we defined a common signature of liver tumors mutated for AXIN1 and demonstrate that these tumors occur independently of the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
