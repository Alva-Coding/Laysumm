TITLE

Rosuvastatin improves the FGF19 analogue NGM282-associated lipid changes in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) represents a large and growing public health concern with no approved therapy.

NGM282, an engineered analogue of the gut hormone FGF19, reduces liver fat, liver injury and inflammation in patients with NASH.

However, NGM282 increases cholesterol levels.

Here we show that co-administration of a statin can manage the cholesterol increase seen in patients with NASH receiving treatment with NGM282, producing a favorable overall lipid profile.
