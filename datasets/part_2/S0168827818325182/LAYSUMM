TITLE

Evaluation of a micro-spectrometer for the real-time assessment of liver graft with mild-to-moderate macrosteatosis: A proof of concept study

PARAGRAPH

Macro-vacuolar liver steatosis is a major prognostic factor for outcomes after liver transplantation.

However, it is often difficult for logistical reasons to get this estimation during procurement.

Therefore, we developed an algorithm for a commercial, portable and affordable spectrometer to accurately estimate this content in a real-time fashion.

This device could be of great interest for clinical decision-making to accept or discard a potential human liver graft.
