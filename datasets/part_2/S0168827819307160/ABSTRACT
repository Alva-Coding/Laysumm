ABSTRACT

TITLE

ARRB1 inhibits non-alcoholic steatohepatitis progression by promoting GDF15 maturation

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with dysregulation of lipid metabolism and hepatic inflammation.

The causal mechanism underlying NASH is not fully elucidated.

We aim to investigate the role of β-arrestin1 (ARRB1) in the progression of NASH.

PARAGRAPH

Human liver tissues from patients with NASH and control subjects were obtained to evaluate ARRB1 expression.

NASH models were established in ARRB1 knockout and wild type mice fed high-fat diet (HFD) for 26 weeks or methionine/choline deficient (MCD) diet for 6 weeks.

PARAGRAPH

ARRB1 expression was diminished in NASH patient liver samples.

Moreover, diminished ARRB1 levels were detected in mice NASH models.

ARRB1 deficiency accelerated steatohepatitis development in HFD-/MCD diet-fed mice accompanied by upregulation of lipogenic genes and downregulation of β-oxidative genes.

Intriguingly, ARRB1 was found to interact with GDF15 and facilitated the transportation of GDF15 precursor (pro-GDF15) to Golgi apparatus for cleavage and maturation.

Treatment with recombinant GDF15 ablated the lipid accumulation in the presence of ARRB1 deletion in vitro and in vivo.

Re-expression of ARRB1 in the NASH models ameliorated the liver disease, and the effect was greater in the presence of pro-GDF15 overexpression.

In contrast, the effect of pro-GDF15 overexpression alone was impaired in ARRB1-deficient mice.

In addition, the severity of liver disease in patients with NASH was negatively correlated with ARRB1 expression.

PARAGRAPH

ARRB1 acts as a vital regulator in the development of NASH via facilitating GDF15’s translocation to the Golgi apparatus and subsequent maturation.

ARRB1 thus is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NASH.
