TITLE

HCV genotype 1-6 NS3 residue 80 substitutions impact protease inhibitor activity and promote viral escape

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Regimens based on direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have revolutionized treatment of patients with chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), which globally has been estimated to cause 70–150 million chronic infections and at least 400,000 deaths annually.1,2

Approved DAAs target the HCV protease (NS3P), NS5A and NS5B.3,4

Protease inhibitors (PIs), available since 2011, constitute an important component of DAA-based combination therapies.3–5

While the initially developed PIs telaprevir and boceprevir have been discontinued, simeprevir might be used for treatment of patients infected with genotype 1, and grazoprevir or paritaprevir for genotypes 1 and 4.6,7

Asunaprevir, approved in Asia and the Middle East, is used only for subtype 1b.3

The novel PIs glecaprevir and voxilaprevir are recommended for genotypes 1-6.6,7

PARAGRAPH

A subset of DAA-treated patients experience treatment failure, which is associated with selection of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) that are either naturally occurring and pre-existing at baseline or rapidly acquired during treatment.3,4

Several clinical studies have provided evidence that baseline RASs in DAA targets can compromise DAA treatment efficacy.4,5

PARAGRAPH

The prevalence of pre-existing RASs depends on their effect on viral fitness, influencing persistence and spread in human populations.

Of described naturally occurring NS3P RASs, Q80K shows the highest prevalence: for genotype 1a-infected patients, 19%, 48% and 9% are carrying Q80K in Europe, North America, and South America, respectively.3,8

Strong regional deviations in Q80K prevalence have been observed, with European prevalence rates ranging from 5% in Norway to 75% in Poland.8

Q80K is rarely observed for genotype 1b and for other genotypes limited data are available.4

For genotypes 1a and 1b, Q80K and the less prevalent Q80R caused resistance to simeprevir in vitro,9–11 and for 1a, baseline Q80K resulted in decreased efficacy of simeprevir-based treatment regimens.4,5

For other genotypes, data on the effect of Q80K on PI efficacy are not available.4

While PI RASs can confer extensive cross-resistance among different PIs, little is known about the impact of Q80K on the efficacy of PIs other than simeprevir.4

Finally, molecular mechanisms underlying treatment failure mediated by baseline RASs have not been studied.

PARAGRAPH

We aimed to characterize the effect of NS3P position-80-substitutions on viral fitness and resistance to the approved PIs simeprevir, asunaprevir, paritaprevir, grazoprevir, glecaprevir, and voxilaprevir for HCV genotypes 1-6 using infectious cell culture systems.

In addition, for selected genotypes we studied the impact of pre-existing Q80K on viral escape from simeprevir, grazoprevir, glecaprevir and voxilaprevir.

Using next generation sequencing (NGS) and haplotype linkage analysis, we investigated resistance evolution underlying accelerated viral escape mediated by pre-existing Q80K.

Material and methods

SECTION

HCV genotype 1-6 viruses

PARAGRAPH

Cell culture adapted recombinants with NS3P of genotypes(isolates) 1a(H77),12 1a(TN),13 1a(HCV1),12 1b(DH1),14 2a(J6),15 2a(JFH1),16 3a(S52),17 5a(SA13)17 and 6a(HK6a)18 were used; the previously reported 4a(ED43) recombinant17 contained 7 novel culture adaptive substitutions (Fig. S1).

Mutations in these recombinants were introduced by QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent).

HCV sequences of final DNA preparations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Macrogen).

SECTION

Evaluation of viral fitness

PARAGRAPH

Huh-7.5 cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and penicillin 100 U/mL/streptomycin 100 µg/ml (Sigma) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and split every 2–3 days.

For transfection, 3.5 × 105 Huh-7.5 cells/well plated the previous day on 6-well plates were transfected with RNA transcripts of HCV recombinants (supplementary information).

Transfection cultures were split every 2–3 days and the percentage of HCV-infected cells was monitored by HCV-antigen immunostaining (supplementary information).

For position-80-variants, spread kinetics monitored by immunostaining were compared to those of the respective original viruses, transfected in the same experiment.

For variants with additional RASs, at different timepoints following transfection, HCV supernatant infectivity titers were determined (supplementary information).

Supernatants from the peak of infection (≥80% HCV antigens positive cells) achieved in transfection or 1st viral passage experiments were used for inoculation of naïve Huh-7.5 cells.

First or 2nd passage virus stocks were generated by collection of supernatants from these viral passage cultures at the peak of infection, and their NS3P sequence was analyzed by Sanger sequencing (see below).

SECTION

Short-term treatment assay for assesment of PI sensitivity

PARAGRAPH

The PIs simeprevir, asunaprevir, paritaprevir, grazoprevir and glecaprevir (Acme Biosciences), as well as voxilaprevir (Gilead Sciences), were dissolved in DMSO.

In established concentration-response experiments,18 6 × 103 Huh-7.5 cells/well, plated the previous day on poly-D-lysine-coated 96-well plates (Nunc), were infected with NS3P sequence confirmed 1st or 2nd passage virus stocks.

Infected cells were treated with dilution series of the PIs 24 h later; each concentration was tested in triplicates.

Immunostaining was carried out and single HCV-infected cells were counted automatically 72 h post-infection (supplementary information).

Counts from treated wells were related to means of counts from infected, non-treated wells.

Following transformation of x-values, sigmoidal concentration–response curves were fitted and EC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism 6.19

Applied PI concentrations were non-cytotoxic, tested here for glecaprevir and voxilaprevir, and previously for the other PIs.17–19

SECTION

Long-term PI treatment assay

PARAGRAPH

For induction of viral escape, Huh-7.5 cells were plated at 3.5 × 105 cells/well on 6-well plates and infected the following day with NS3P sequence confirmed virus stocks of 1a(HCV1) or 3a(S52) with or without Q80K.

On day 1 post-infection, infected cells were trypsinized and transferred to T25 culture flasks, where they were maintained throughout the experiment.

Every 2–3 days cells were split and plated for immunostaining, which was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy for determination of the percentage of HCV-infected cells.

For simeprevir- and grazoprevir-experiments, infected with the original virus and Q80K-variant at the same multiplicity of infection, treatment was initiated on day 2 and 4 post-infection, respectively.

Glecaprevir and voxilaprevir treatments were initiated on day 8 post-infection, when both viruses had spread to all culture cells.

PI treatment was applied when cells were split, every 2–3 days, using the specified fold-EC50 for 1a(HCV1) or 3a(S52).

Non-treated control cultures were included for comparison.

SECTION

HCV sequence analysis

PARAGRAPH

For Sanger sequencing, HCV RNA was extracted from cell culture supernatants, followed by RT-nested PCR spanning NS3P-NS4A using genotype-specific primers (supplementary information).

From these amplicons, NS3P was sequenced (Macrogen).

Sequence analysis was done with Sequencher (GeneCodes).

PARAGRAPH

For NGS, we amplified the entire coding genome sequence (supplementary information).

NGS was carried out in-house by Illumina Miseq using the v2 500 cycle kit.

Minor single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants were identified as described.20

Linkage of NS3P substitutions was done by selecting coding SNPs >0.5% and running LinkGE on all positions for each sample.21

Haplotypes constituting >2% of the viral population were plotted in GraphPad Prism 6.

When different nucleotide changes resulted in the same amino acid (aa) change, the variants were grouped as the same haplotype.

Results

SECTION

Activity of clinically relevant PIs against HCV genotypes 1-6

PARAGRAPH

We investigated the activity of 6 clinically relevant PIs against 10 cell culture infectious recombinants with NS3P of HCV genotypes 1-6 using short-term concentration-response assays (Fig. S1).

In line with previous findings, simeprevir, asunaprevir, and paritaprevir showed the highest activity against genotypes 1 and 4 and the lowest activity against genotype 3.

For grazoprevir we found higher potency and less genotype-specific EC50 differences, however, relatively low activity against genotype 3 (Fig. 1A).13–15,17–19,22

Here, we investigated for the first time the activity of the new PIs glecaprevir and voxilaprevir, which showed true pan-genotypic activity with similar activity against all tested genotype 1-6 cell culture viruses (Fig. 1).

SECTION

Substitutions at NS3P position 80 had differential effects on viral fitness and PI-resistance for HCV genotypes 1-6

PARAGRAPH

At NS3P position 80, 1a(H77), 1a(HCV1), 1b(DH1), 3a(S52) and 4a(ED43) originally had Q, 1a(TN), 5a(SA13) and 6a(HK6a) had K, while 2a(J6) and 2a(JFH1) had G (Fig. 2A).

We engineered 20 position-80-variants to investigate the impact of K and Q on each recombinant, and of R or L on selected recombinants (Fig. 2B).

RNA transcripts of engineered variants were transfected into Huh-7.5 cells, and viral spread kinetics were evaluated by HCV-immunostaining.

Variants of 1a(H77), 1a(HCV1), 1b(DH1), 3a(S52), 4a(ED43) and 6a(HK6a) showed comparable or slightly impaired spread kinetics compared to the respective original viruses (Fig. 2B).

In contrast, for variants of 1a(TN), 2a(J6), 2a(JFH1) and 5a(SA13) viral spread was significantly delayed compared to that of the original viruses.

However, all variants proved viable and maintained the engineered substitutions after 1st and/or 2nd viral passage in naïve cells.

NS3P sequencing revealed additional substitutions in NS3P for the following variants: K122T and S160C in 2a(J6)G80K; T174S in 2a(J6)G80Q; N72N/H in 4a(ED43)Q80K, and D112d/A in 5a(SA13)K80Q.

PARAGRAPH

Position-80-substitutions had a differential impact on PI sensitivity, determined by treatment of passage virus stocks in short-term treatment assays (Fig. 3).

The most pronounced effect was observed for simeprevir: Q80K conferred 3- to 21-fold resistance to all tested recombinants (Fig. 3).

For viruses that originally did not have Q at position 80, K80Q caused an 8- to 24-fold increase in sensitivity, while G80Q/K had no-to-little impact on sensitivity.

A change to R at position 80 conferred no- to 13-fold resistance.

Finally, a change to L conferred no- to 5-fold increased sensitivity.

PARAGRAPH

For the remaining PIs the engineered position-80-substitutions had no-to-little impact on sensitivity (Fig. 3).

Threefold resistance was observed for asunaprevir against 1a(HCV1)Q80K and 1b(DH1)Q80R, as well as for paritaprevir, grazoprevir and glecaprevir against 3a(S52)Q80K.

Finally, 2a(J6)G80Q showed 3-fold resistance to glecaprevir and voxilaprevir.

SECTION

Q80K promoted accelerated escape of 1a(HCV1) by concentration-dependent co-selection of RASs under treatment with simeprevir and grazoprevir

PARAGRAPH

In the short-term assay we observed relatively small differences in EC50 for position-80-variants treated with PIs other than simeprevir (Fig. 3).

We hypothesized that such differences, however, could result in more pronounced differences in a long-term treatment assay, better reflecting a clinical setting.

Therefore, we subjected 1a(HCV1)Q80K and original 1a(HCV1) viruses to long-term treatment with the same concentrations of grazoprevir, widely used in the clinic for treatment of genotype 1, applying 1- to 128-fold EC50, relating to the EC50 determined for 1a(HCV1) (Fig. 1).

For comparison, we also carried out treatment with 2- to 128-fold EC50 of simeprevir.

Interestingly, under treatment with both PIs and at all concentrations, Q80K promoted viral escape with all 1a(HCV1)Q80K cultures showing accelerated spread kinetics compared to the original 1a(HCV1) cultures (Fig. 4A,B); viral suppression was observed for simeprevir at 128-fold EC50 for 1a(HCV1), but not 1a(HCV1)Q80K.

PARAGRAPH

To elucidate molecular mechanisms causing viral escape, viruses that spread under PI treatment were subjected to NGS and NS3P linkage analysis.

For both PIs, similar patterns regarding the acquisition of substitutions were observed (Fig. 4C-F).

At low concentrations, 2-fold EC50 for simeprevir and 1-fold EC50 for grazoprevir, pre-existing Q80K was sufficient to mediate viral escape, resulting in a homogeneous virus population with Q80K as the single dominant NS3P substitution.

In contrast, under these concentrations, for the original 1a(HCV1) a heterogeneous virus population was selected harboring various NS3P RASs.

PARAGRAPH

At intermediate PI concentrations, 8-fold EC50 for simeprevir and 2-fold EC50 for grazoprevir, escape of the original 1a(HCV1) was mainly mediated by acquisition of single high-level resistance RASs, predominantly R155K under simeprevir and A156T under grazoprevir.

In contrast, these substitutions were only selected in a minority of 1a(HCV1)Q80K viruses, where escape was mediated by Q80K alone or by co-selection of different RASs in addition to Q80K.

Thus, following escape from grazoprevir, 1a(HCV1)F43L + Q80K and 1a(HCV1)Q80K + D168E predominated.

PARAGRAPH

At higher PI concentrations, >8-fold EC50 for simeprevir and >2-fold EC50 for grazoprevir, for the original 1a(HCV1) escape was mainly mediated by the single high-level resistance substitutions R155K and A156T, respectively, as observed under intermediate concentrations.

However, for 1a(HCV1)Q80K, in contrast to our findings at intermediate concentrations, R155K and A156T were also co-selected with pre-existing Q80K.

SECTION

Pre-existing Q80K aided selection of escape variants with fitness or resistance advantages

PARAGRAPH

To investigate the effect of pre-existing Q80K on the characteristics of resulting escape variants, we engineered the 1a(HCV1)Q80K escape variant 1a(HCV1)Q80K + R155K, selected under 32- and 128-fold EC50 of simeprevir.

This variant showed higher fitness than the 1a(HCV1) escape variant 1a(HCV1)R155K, also selected under 32-fold EC50 of simeprevir, as determined by comparison of HCV infectivity titers in transfection experiments (Fig. 5A).

In addition, compared to 1a(HCV1)R155K, 1a(HCV1)Q80K + R155K showed increased simeprevir resistance (Fig. 5B).

The 1a(HCV1)Q80K escape variants 1a(HCV1)Q80K + F43L and 1a(HCV1)Q80K + D168E, selected under 2- and 8-fold EC50 of grazoprevir, had higher fitness than 1a(HCV1)A156T, selected under the same concentration from 1a(HCV1) (Fig. 5C) and showed resistance to grazoprevir (Fig. 5D).

The RAS A156T reverted in both 1a(HCV1)Q80K + A156T and 1a(HCV1)A156T, selected under grazoprevir from 1a(HCV1)Q80K and 1a(HCV1), respectively.

Low fitness of position-156-variants and reversion to A156 is in line with previous in vitro findings.9,19,22–24

SECTION

Under treatment with glecaprevir and voxilaprevir, Q80K had limited effect on escape of 1a(HCV1), but promoted accelerated escape of 3a(S52)

PARAGRAPH

While escape occurred in all genotype 1a cultures, Q80K promoted accelerated escape only under 2- and 128-fold of glecaprevir (Fig. 6A); Q80K did not promote accelerated escape under treatment with any concentration of voxilaprevir (Fig. 6B).

NGS and NS3P linkage analysis revealed that under treatment with both PIs at most concentrations A156T dominated for 1a(HCV1) and Q80K + A156T dominated for 1a(HCV1)Q80K escape variants (Fig. 6C-F).

Only under 2-fold EC50 of glecaprevir a different pattern was observed.

Here, 1a(HCV1)Q80K escape variants comprised various populations harboring Q80K in combination with substitutions at positions different from 156, including Y56H and D168E; in contrast, A156T dominated in 1a(HCV1) escape variants.

Under 1-fold EC50 of both PIs both genotype 1a viruses mostly spread without selection of substitutions.

PARAGRAPH

In contrast to our findings for genotype 1a, for genotype 3a pre-existing Q80K promoted accelerated escape under treatment with all concentrations of glecaprevir and voxilaprevir (Fig. 7A,B).

At high PI concentrations (>8-fold EC50 for glecaprevir and >2 fold EC50 for voxilaprevir), A156V dominated for 3a(S52) and Q80K + A156V with or without R155K dominated for 3a(S52)Q80K escape variants (Fig. 7C-F).

Intermediate concentrations (8-fold EC50) of glecaprevir led to selection of A156T/V in 3a(S52) and to co-selection of several different substitutions in 3a(S52)Q80K, including A156G.

Under treatment with 1- and 2-fold EC50 of both PIs, genotype 3a viruses mostly spread without selection of substitutions.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Among all clinically relevant PIs only glecaprevir and voxilaprevir showed pan-genotypic activity.

HCV genotype 1-6 position-80-variants showed relatively high fitness.

In classical short-term resistance assays, Q80K conferred simeprevir resistance across genotypes, but no-to-little resistance to other PIs.

However, Q80K had the potential to promote accelerated viral escape from other PIs in long-term treatments.

Carrying pre-existing Q80K, genotype 3a appeared to be more prone to escape from glecaprevir and voxilaprevir than genotype 1a.

Thus, we describe here for the first time for HCV genotypes 1-6 the impact of position-80-substitutions on fitness and resistance to all 6 clinically relevant PIs and reveal that pre-existing position-80-substitutions facilitate accelerated escape from PIs.

PARAGRAPH

In vitro testing is necessary to study DAA activity and putative RASs.25

Compared to enzymatic assays and replicons, HCV infectious culture systems reflect the full viral life cycle and previous results in these systems reflected clinical data.13–15,17–19,22–24

However, cell culture adaptive substitutions, especially those found in NS3P of the 1a(H77),12 2a(J6)15 and 6a(HK6a)18 recombinants, might influence study results.

PARAGRAPH

Amino acid residues at position 80 in the used HCV recombinants were representative for the respective genotypes in treatment-naïve HCV-infected individuals.

Thus, in genotype 1a infected patients position 80 displayed mainly Q and K, but also G, L, N and R.10,26 Similar observations were made by analysis of sequences deposited in databases:27,28 among 307 genotype 1a sequences Q and K were predominant at position 80, while G, L, N and R were found in a minor percentage.

For genotype 1b, among 327 sequences, Q was predominant, while K and L were observed to a minor extent.

For genotype 3a, Q was found in all of 170 sequences.

For genotypes 2a, 4a, 5a and 6a the number of available sequences was limited: for 2a, all 19 sequences had G, for 4a all 17 had Q, for 5a both had K and for 6a 14/16 had K, 1/16 had Q and 1/16 had L. For genotype 5a, 10/11 additional sequences had K, while 1/11 had Q.29,30 For genotype 6a, 4 additional sequences had K.30

PARAGRAPH

The relatively high fitness of engineered position-80 variants is in line with the high prevalence of position-80-polymorphisms in vivo, and with position-80-polymorphisms having little-to-no impact on genotype 1 replication capacity in vitro.9,23

Interestingly, Q80K acted as a fitness compensating substitution for R155K.

Thus, position-80 RASs can be expected to persist in patients carrying these RASs also without PI pressure.

Except for 6a(HK6a), Q80 decreased fitness when introduced in recombinants, originally harboring different aa residues.

PARAGRAPH

Our findings on PI activity against original genotype 1-6 viruses in short-term treatment assays are in line with previous in vitro activity and clinical efficacy studies.5,14,17–19,22,31–36

Sensitivity of the original viruses to simeprevir depended on the residue at position 80.

Except for 3a(S52), Q80 resulted in relatively high and K/G80 in relatively low sensitivity.

Natural resistance of genotype 3a isolates to simeprevir and other PIs is probably explained by the presence of other NS3P polymorphisms such as Q168 or V170.5,18,31

The impact of position-80-substitutions on the effect of simeprevir depended on the simeprevir sensitivity of the original recombinants and thus also on the original aa at position 80.

Thus, Q80K conferred a higher level of simeprevir resistance than G80K.

Also, except for genotype 3a, Q80R but not K80R conferred simeprevir resistance.

While this is the first study using genotype 1-6 infectious cell culture systems and a broad panel of all clinically relevant PIs for in vitro evaluation of position-80-polymorphisms, our results agree with results previously obtained in genotype 1a and 1b replicon studies.9,10,37

PARAGRAPH

Small differences in EC50 might be of clinical relevance.10

Also in this study, minor differences in EC50 in short-term assays translated into more pronounced effects during long-term treatment for grazoprevir, glecaprevir and voxilaprevir.

The fact that Q80K had a greater potential to promote escape from novel pan-genotypic PIs for genotype 3a than for genotype 1a might add to the reasons why genotype 3a is emerging as difficult to treat with DAAs.5

However, prevalence of Q80K in genotype 3a is rare and current treatment regimens use PIs in combination with NS5A and/or NS5B inhibitors, which is likely to minimize the effect of pre-existing Q80K and other pre-existing RASs on overall treatment efficacies.38

Nevertheless, in the clinical setting, there is preliminary evidence that Q80K might have a negative effect not only on the efficacy of certain simeprevir- but also of certain asunaprevir- paritaprevir-, grazoprevir- and voxilaprvir-based treatment regimens in genotype 1 infected patients.4,5,39,40

The impact of pre-existing Q80K could vary for the same PI given in combination with different antivirals.

Thus, Q80K reduced treatment efficacy of simeprevir/peginterferon/ribavirin more than that of simeprevir/sofosbuvir in genotype 1 infected patients.4,5

Given the high cost of DAAs and thus the relevance of choosing the most efficient treatment regimen, the clinical effects of pre-existing Q80K on DAA combinations containing different PIs remain to be investigated in detail.

PARAGRAPH

NGS substitution linkage analysis and haplotype reconstruction was previously only used for short genome segments and not in the context of antiviral resistance.21

We optimized this approach to cover a complete viral protein and major DAA target, enabling us to investigate resistance associated NS3P haplotypes in unprecedented detail.

Mostly for simeprevir and grazoprevir, and to a lesser extent for glecaprevir, increasing PI concentrations created an evolutionary bottleneck, driving the selection of highly resistant viruses.

While low PI concentrations selected for various NS3P haplotypes with different substitutions occurring individually or in various combinations, high PI concentrations selected for few NS3P haplotypes dominated by high-level resistance RASs such as R155K and A156T.5

In contrast, for voxilaprevir A156T/V dominated in all escape cultures, possibly because of its increased activity against several low-level resistance RASs.34

RASs selected in original viruses were comparable to those selected in replicons and in patients under PIs used in this study.3–5,11,33,35,36,39–46

In addition, selection of RASs R155K, D168E and I170T under simeprevir and of position-168 RASs under grazoprevir in genotype 1a infected patients with baseline Q80K highlights the clinical relevance of our results.10,40,47,48

Our data underline the central importance of NS3P position 156 for resistance to the clinically highly important PIs grazoprevir, glecaprevir and voxilaprevir.3–5

PARAGRAPH

The capacity to escape high PI concentrations was not directly linked to resistance exerted by Q80K.

Rather, Q80K facilitated rapid co-selection of additional RASs, leading to faster escape and to escape variants with higher fitness and/or resistance compared to escape variants selected in experiments with the original viruses.

We hypothesize that upon treatment initiation, Q80K variants might have an evolutionary advantage due to increased growth capacity under treatment, allowing faster selection of variants carrying additional RASs and/or fitness compensating substitutions.49

PARAGRAPH

Studies of the highly polymorphic NS3P position 80 in HCV genotypes 1-6 are of relevance given that the indication for PI-based treatment regimens has recently been expanded to include all major HCV genotypes.

Increased knowledge on the prevalence and effect of baseline polymorphisms in DAA targets on different DAAs could help clinicians make optimal treatment choices and thus avoid the development of a resistance-bearing patient cohort.
