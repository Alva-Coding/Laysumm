TITLE

The long non-coding RNA LncHDAC2 drives the self-renewal of liver cancer stem cells via activation of Hedgehog signaling

PARAGRAPH

Liver cancer stem cells harbor high tumor-initiating potential and confer resistance to typical therapies, but the mechanism underlying their self-renewal remains elusive.

LncHDAC2 augments the self-renewal of these cells, promoting tumor propagation.

In liver cancer stem cells, lncHDAC2 activates Hedgehog signaling to initiate liver tumorigenesis.

Therefore, lncHDAC2 and the Hedgehog signaling pathway may serve as biomarkers and potential drug targets for hepatocellular carcinoma.
