TITLE

Antiviral therapy in hepatitis B virus-infected children with immune-tolerant characteristics: A pilot open-label randomized study

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Despite extensive vaccination programs, chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in children remains a serious health problem worldwide.1–5

Even though a benign course of chronic HBV infection during childhood has been described, 3–5% and 0.01–0.03% of chronic carriers develop cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) before adulthood.6

Considering the whole lifetime, the risk of HCC rises to 9–24% and the incidence of cirrhosis to 2–3% per year.7

In children, chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is characterized by its natural course, including immune-tolerant phase, immune-active state and inactive carrier.

Ideally, a child with CHB should be treated early to prevent the development of cirrhosis and HCC.

Nevertheless, to date, no therapeutic interventions have been recommended by the guidelines for the pediatric immune-tolerant CHB, because of the scarcity of available data.6,8,9

Low therapeutic coverage exacerbated by restrictive treatment guidelines may facilitate disease progression in many patients.

Thus, earlier treatment than recommended by current guidelines should be considered.10

PARAGRAPH

Interferon-α (IFN) represents the first choice for the treatment of children with CHB.3,11

Lamivudine (LAM), one approved nucleoside analogue (NA) for pediatric CHB in China, is indicated to be effective and safe.12,13

IFN acts through the body’s immune system while LAM can directly inhibit HBV DNA polymerase.

A guideline for management of CHB in childhood pointed out that combination therapy with IFN and LAM was promising and further data were needed.6

Regarding pediatric immune-tolerant CHB, a combination of LAM and IFN was reported to induce complete viral control according to two previous studies.14,15

Therefore, we designed the current pilot, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to study the efficacy and safety of sequential combination therapy with IFN and LAM in treatment-naive chronically HBV-infected children who had immune-tolerant characteristics.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Study design

PARAGRAPH

This is a pilot open-label RCT that is registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (www.chictr.org.cn, identifier: ChiCTR-TRC-14004684).

From May 2014 to April 2015, patients were recruited from the Pediatric Liver Diseases Therapy and Research Center in Beijing 302 Hospital.

Using a randomization table (derived from SAS 9.2 software [SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA]), we randomly assigned eligible children, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive antiviral therapy (treatment group) or to receive no antiviral therapies (only undergo clinical observation, control group).

All patients were evaluated at baseline and at weeks 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96.

SECTION

Patient population

PARAGRAPH

Eligible participants were treatment-naive chronically HBV-infected children aged 1 to 16 years who had immune-tolerant characteristics (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] positive ≥6 months, hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg] positive, anti-HBe negative, HBV DNA >107 IU/ml, alanine aminotransferase [ALT] <60 U/L [1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN, 40 U/L)] and no or minimal inflammation in liver histology [evaluated according to Scheuer’s criteria16 in the study]).17

Considering that LAM was approved for children older than two years, participants had to be older than one year and nine months when included in the trial.

The exclusion criteria were the following: previous antiviral treatment for HBV infection; coinfection with hepatitis A, C, D, E, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus or human immunodeficiency virus; coexistence of any other liver diseases such as autoimmune hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury or Wilson’s disease; liver transplantation; past or current HCCs; evidence of thyroid disorders.

Patients who were unwilling to accept liver biopsy were also excluded.

SECTION

Antiviral regimen

PARAGRAPH

Patients initially received IFN monotherapy (3 MU/m2 to 5 MU/m2, qod) for 12 weeks.

After that, LAM (3 mg/kg/day) was added to patients who had serum HBV DNA that had declined to <2 log10 (by PCR, Roche COBAS AmpliPrep, lower limit of detection: 20 IU/ml) up to week 72 and subsequently LAM alone was used until week 96; for patients who had serum HBV DNA that had declined by ≥2 log10, IFN monotherapy was continued through to week 72 and then clinical follow-up went on until week 96 (Fig. 1).

PARAGRAPH

The HBV reverse-transcriptase gene was sequenced in patients who did not achieve undetectable serum HBV DNA at week 96 among the treatment group.

The detailed sequencing procedure can be provided in our previous paper.18

SECTION

Outcome measures

PARAGRAPH

The primary outcome was the rate of patients who developed serum HBeAg seroconversion (loss of HBeAg and presence of anti-HBe) at week 96.

The co-primary outcome was the rate of patients who had undetectable serum HBV DNA at week 96.

The secondary efficacy end-points included HBsAg loss (HBsAg quantification by Roche COBAS HBsAgII-Q, lower limit of detection: 0.05 IU/ml) and seroconversion.

Adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs were assessed at each visit.

SECTION

Sample size

PARAGRAPH

The sample size of 69 patients provided 90% power (two-sided significance level, 0.05) to show the statistical differences between the treatment group and the control group, assuming a serum HBeAg seroconversion rate of 39% for the treatment group and 5% for the control group.7,15

SECTION

Ethics approval

PARAGRAPH

The study was approved by the ethics committees of Beijing 302 Hospital.

Informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians of all children and assent from older children as appropriate before enrollment.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Data analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA).

Continuous data were expressed as median (inter-quartile range).

Categorical data were expressed as the number of subjects or percentages.

Group comparisons were performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables, and the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables.

Logistic regression was conducted to identify independent predictors of response to antiviral therapy.

Tests were two-sided and a p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

SECTION

Results

SECTION

Baseline characteristics

PARAGRAPH

A total of 69 patients were randomized, of which 46 were in the treatment group and 23 in the control group.

Of the 69 patients, 43 were boys and 26 girls.

No withdrawal happened among the 69 patients.

In the treatment group, one patient received IFN monotherapy from the beginning of the trial through to week 72 because the patient achieved a more than 2 log10 reduction in serum HBV DNA at week 12.

PARAGRAPH

There were no significant differences between the treatment group and the control group with respect to the characteristics of the patients at baseline (Table 1).

Age distribution in the treatment group was consistent with that in the control group, with most children aged between 7 and 16 years old.

The distributions of grade of inflammation and stage of fibrosis across the treatment and control groups were consistent.

HBsAg-positive mothers predominated with regard to the family history of HBV infection in both groups.

SECTION

Outcome analysis

PARAGRAPH

Median levels of serum HBV DNA, ALT and HBsAg quantification at each visit (weeks 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96) for patients in the treatment group and control group are shown (Table 2).

PARAGRAPH

In the control group, only one (4.35%) patient underwent spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion at week 48 and her serum HBV DNA reached an undetectable level at week 72.

The status lasted until the end of the trial.

No patients developed HBsAg loss or seroconversion throughout the trial.

PARAGRAPH

Among the treatment group, the rates of patients with undetectable serum HBV DNA were 54.35% (25/46) at week 48 and 67.39% (31/46) at week 72.

The rate rose to 73.91% (34/46) at the endpoint.

HBeAg seroconversion occurred in two patients (4.35%) and HBsAg loss emerged in three patients (6.52%) at week 48.

At week 72, 21.74% (10/46) patients underwent HBeAg seroconversion and 19.57% (9/46) patients lost HBsAg.

At week 96, the rates increased to 32.61% (15/46) in HBeAg seroconversion and 21.74% (10/46) in HBsAg loss.

Of the 10 patients with HBsAg loss at week 96, seven achieved HBsAg seroconversion.

In addition, four patients had a serum HBsAg concentration lower than 10 IU/ml at week 96.

The rates of patients with HBeAg seroconversion and patients with HBsAg loss at weeks 48, 72 and 96 are summarized (Fig. 2).

There was no significant difference regarding median ALT levels at the endpoint across both groups (p = 0.5924).

PARAGRAPH

Baseline variables, including sex, age, body mass index, HBV DNA (log10), ALT, HBsAg quantification (log10), HBV genotypes, grade of inflammation and stage of fibrosis in liver histo logy, were included in the multivariate analysis to identify the predictors of response (serum HBeAg seroconversion at week 96) to antiviral therapy.

The results revealed that ALT (odds ratio [OR] 1.066; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.010–1.124; p = 0.0300) was the independent predictor of response at baseline.

The relationship between ALT and the estimated probability of response (serum HBeAg seroconversion at week 96) to antiviral therapy is shown (Fig. 3).

SECTION

Safety evaluation

PARAGRAPH

No serious AEs were observed in any patients.

No AEs were reported in the control group.

Among the treatment group, patients the antiviral therapy was well tolerated.

Reported AEs are listed (Table 3).

Fever was the most common AE (42/46).

Subsequently, neutropenia developed in 38 patients, decreased appetite in 24, tiredness in 15 and hair loss in 13.

Other AEs included rash (five patients), arthralgia (three patients), dyssomnia (one patient) and thyroid dysfunction (one patient).

No patients experienced ALT elevation more than 10 times ULN.

Viro logical breakthrough did not occur during treatment.

LAM genotypic resistance was not found at the endpoint.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In areas of the world with a high prevalence of HBV (e.g. China, South East Asia and Africa), perinatal/vertical transmission is the main mode of spread.19–21

In the United States, nearly 1.32 million people with HBV infection were foreign born, with 58% having emigrated from Asia.19

The vast majority of children infected at birth are immune-tolerant.7

However, whether these immune-tolerant children are indicated for antiviral treatment remains controversial.

Therefore, we designed this study to analyze this.

All patients had good compliance to the study procedure.

Patients who used LAM in the treatment group continued to receive LAM therapy after study completion and all patients were kept in the long-term follow-up.

PARAGRAPH

Generally, seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe represents the entry into the immune-control or non-replicative phase, while the complete resolution of HBV infection is characterized by loss of HBsAg and appearance of anti-HBs.

Spontaneous rates of HBeAg seroconversion in children infected perinatally are low, occurring in fewer than 2% of children younger than three years per year and in 4%–5% of children older than three years.7

Regarding spontaneous annual HBsAg clearance, the rates in longitudinal studies in Asians with vertically transmitted HBV are extremely low, between 0.5% and 1.4%.22

In the present study, only one (4.35%) patient in the control group underwent spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion and no patients developed HBsAg loss or seroconversion.

PARAGRAPH

Compared with the control group, the treatment group had apparent differences in the rates of undetectable serum HBV DNA, HBeAg seroconversion, and HBsAg loss and seroconversion.

At the endpoint, 73.91% patients achieved maintained viro logical response, 32.61% developed HBeAg seroconversion and 21.74% lost HBsAg.

These results demonstrated a potent efficacy of the antiviral regimen in suppressing HBV DNA and clearing HBeAg and HBsAg.

PARAGRAPH

Currently, no published results from RCTs can be referenced to pediatric immune-tolerant CHB.

In the single-treatment-arm study by D'Antiga et al., 78% patients became HBV DNA negative, 22% patients developed HBeAg seroconversion and 17% patients achieved HBsAg loss under the antiviral regimen of pretreatment with LAM alone for eight weeks and then LAM and IFN in combination for 10 months.14

Another prospective study by Poddar et al. showed that the antiviral regimen of sequential combination therapy with LAM and IFN (first eight weeks only LAM and the later 44 weeks LAM plus IFN) was tolerated well by all 28 patients with immune-tolerant CHB.15

At the end of follow-up, 61% patients had undetectable serum HBV DNA, 39% achieved HBeAg seroconversion and 21% lost HBsAg.

As for the present study, in brief, the efficacy rate of antiviral therapy in terms of HBeAg seroconversion was higher than that reported in D'Antiga et al.’s study and similar to that in Poddar et al.’s study.

Moreover, the rate of undetectable serum HBV DNA in the study was higher than that in Poddar et al.’s study and similar to that in D'Antiga et al.’s study.

Overall, in terms of some parameter, efficacy of the antiviral regimen in our study was similar with and superior to that in Poddar et al.’s or D'Antiga et al.’s studies.

The regimen of IFN monotherapy as initial treatment in our study seemed more rational because IFN was generally suggested as the first choice for antiviral therapy in children with CHB.

Additionally, our criteria for distinguishing immune-tolerant CHB were more accurate and strict than the other two studies since we set the eligible upper limit of ALT level as 60 U/L (D'Antiga et al.’s study, unclear and one included patient with 111 U/L at baseline; Poddar et al.’s study, <80 U/L).23

PARAGRAPH

Interestingly, individuals among the treatment group presented diverse features in the course of HBeAg and HBsAg clearance.

Of the 10 patients who achieved HBsAg loss, five initially lost HBsAg and later HBeAg, two cleared HBeAg earlier than HBsAg, and three lost HBeAg and HBsAg simultaneously.

This contributed to the higher rate of patients with HBsAg loss than that of patients with HBeAg seroconversion at week 48.

However, the mechanism of HBsAg clearance prior to HBeAg loss was unclear.

PARAGRAPH

Growth retardation was reported in children receiving IFN therapy24 while opposite outcomes also existed.25

Moreover, the effect was generally reversible with cessation of IFN therapy.26

Thus, we did not assess the effect in the current study based on the pilot nature of the trial.

Fever was the most common side effect of IFN therapy in the trial, consistent with previous reports.27

Neutropenia was another frequent side effect during treatment, which reversed through dose adjustment of IFN within the range of 3 MU/m2 to 5 MU/m2.

No patients developed LAM resistance at the endpoint, which, we inferred, might be associated with the combination use of IFN and LAM.

Based on previous studies, regulatory immune responses including interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-beta significantly decreased as a result of NA therapy and T helper 17-associated cytokines also decreased significantly, which could lead to the occurrence of NA resistance.28

The addition of IFN improved the immune response.

PARAGRAPH

The level of ALT was an independent predictor of serum HBeAg seroconversion to antiviral therapy, in line with another study.29

However, considering that the sample size was not large (a major limitation of the current study), the result needs to be further investigated.

In our following large-sample trials, subgroups will be divided according to ALT levels (e.g. a subgroup with normal ALT and the other with abnormal ALT).

Additionally, growth evaluation will also be considered in subsequent trials.

SECTION

Conclusion

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, antiviral treatment with a sequential combination of IFN and LAM resulted in a significant improvement in the rates of undetectable serum HBV DNA, HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg loss for children with immune-tolerant characteristics.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported RCT regarding antiviral therapy in children with chronic HBV infection and immune-tolerant characteristics.
