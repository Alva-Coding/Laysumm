ABSTRACT

TITLE

The global prevalence and genetic spectrum of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency: A rare condition that mimics NAFLD

PARAGRAPH

Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D) is an autosomal recessive condition that may present in a mild form (cholesteryl ester storage disease [CESD]), which mimics non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

It has been suggested that CESD may affect 1 in 40,000 and is under-diagnosed in NAFLD clinics.

Therefore, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of LAL-D using analysis of genetic variation in LIPA.

PARAGRAPH

MEDLINE and EMBASE were systematically searched for previously reported disease variants and prevalence estimates.

Previous prevalence estimates were meta-analysed.

Disease variants in LIPA were annotated with allele frequencies from gnomAD and combined with unreported major functional variants found in humans.

Pooled ethnicity-specific prevalences for LAL-D and CESD were calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg equation.

PARAGRAPH

Meta-analysis of existing genetic studies estimated the prevalence of LAL-D as 1 per 160,000 (95% CI 1 per 65,025–761,652) using the allele frequency of c.894G>A in LIPA.

A total of 98 previously reported disease variants in LIPA were identified, of which 32/98 were present in gnomAD, giving a prevalence of 1 per 307,482 (95% CI 257,672–366,865).

Wolman disease was associated with more loss-of-function variants than CESD.

When this was combined with 22 previously unreported major functional variants in LIPA identified in humans, the pooled prevalence of LAL-D was 1 per 177,452 (95% CI 149,467–210,683) with a carrier frequency of 1 per 421.

The prevalence is lowest in those of East Asian, South Asian, and Finnish ancestry.

PARAGRAPH

Using 120 disease variants in LIPA, these data can reassure clinicians that LAL-D is an ultra-rare disorder.

Given the therapeutic capability of sebelipase alpha, investigation for LAL-D might be included in second-line metabolic screening in NAFLD.
