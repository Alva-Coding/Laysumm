TITLE

The global prevalence and genetic spectrum of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency: A rare condition that mimics NAFLD

PARAGRAPH

Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency (LAL-D) is a rare genetic condition that can cause severe liver disease, but it is difficult to diagnose and sometimes can look like simple fatty liver.

It was not clear how common LAL-D was and whether many cases were being missed.

To study this, we searched for all genetic mutations that could cause LAL-D, calculated how common those mutations were, and added them up.

This let us estimate that LAL-D affects roughly 1 in 175,000 people.

We conclude that LAL-D is a very rare condition, but it is treatable so may be included in a ‘second-line’ of tests for causes of fatty liver.
