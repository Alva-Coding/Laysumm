TITLE

The global prevalence and genetic spectrum of lysosomal acid lipase deficiency: A rare condition that mimics NAFLD

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in LIPA that manifest as a spectrum of liver disease and dyslipidaemia.1,2

It is regarded as a rare disorder however recognition of more mild forms of the condition have led to the suggestion that it may represent a significant proportion of patients presenting with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).3,4

Emerging data have also reported reduced lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) activity in association with more advanced NAFLD.5–8

Clarity on the prevalence of LAL-D, and its distribution across ethnicities, is needed to determine whether LAL activity testing should be a routine part of NAFLD clinics.

PARAGRAPH

LIPA encodes the lipase A protein, which functions to catalyse the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in the lysosome.9,10

Loss-of-function mutations are associated with the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in lysosomes in hepatocytes, macrophages, and the spleen.

LAL-D describes a spectrum of clinical disease where its most severe form is Wolman disease (WD) (with <1% LIPA activity), presenting with acute liver failure at under 4 months of age, microvesicular steatosis, hepatosplenomegaly, failure to thrive, and adrenal calcification.

Without treatment, WD is fatal at under a year, but enzyme replacement therapy significantly improves prognosis.

PARAGRAPH

Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) is used to refer to a more mild form of the disorder, characterised by 1–5% LIPA activity.11,12

It presents insidiously with elevated aminotransferases, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidaemia, gradual decline in hepatic function, and premature atherosclerosis.

These conditions are difficult to diagnose; it is unclear how many children die of undiagnosed WD and there is currently no consensus on routine testing for LIPA activity in adults presenting with NAFLD.

PARAGRAPH

The true prevalence of LAL-D (both CESD and WD) is not known.

The most common LIPA variant associated with CESD is a splice-junction mutation in exon 8 (rs116928232: c.894G>A, p.S275_Q298del), referred to as E8SJM,13 which has been used to derive an estimated prevalence as high as 1 per 40,000.

This is much higher than clinical observations, leading to the suggestion that LAL-D is under-diagnosed and may be unmasked in patients presenting with NAFLD.3,14–16

PARAGRAPH

It is also not yet established whether heterozygous carriers of pathogenic LIPA variants are at increased risk of progressive liver disease in combination with other insults to the hepatic parenchyma.

Data are conflicting as to whether the heterozygous carrier state influences circulating lipid profile.17,18

PARAGRAPH

Based on these data, we hypothesised that the clinical prevalence of LAL-D would be lower than the estimated genetic prevalence and that there may be a minority of patients with NAFLD who have undiagnosed LAL-D.

Therefore, in order to address this and estimate the potential impact of under-diagnosis we aimed to calculate the population prevalence of LAL-D by: i) Meta-analysis of previous prevalence estimates; ii) aggregation of population allele frequencies for previously reported pathogenic LIPA variants; iii) Identification of previously unreported major functional LIPA variants from next generation sequencing data.

Materials and methods

SECTION

Systematic review of previous prevalence estimates

PARAGRAPH

NCBI Pubmed/MEDLINE and EMBASE were systematically searched for all articles related to LIPA, WD, CESD, or LAL-D (see Supplementary methods for full search term used).

The search was finalised on 12/07/2018.

Two reviewers (AC & JPM) independently screened abstracts to assess relevance.

Any disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer.

Inclusion criteria were: reporting an original estimate of prevalence or incidence or pathogenic allele frequency for LAL-D, CESD, or WD, determined by either genetically or by identification of clinical cases.

Reviews, commentaries and editorials reporting non-original data; and in vitro or non-human studies were excluded.

PARAGRAPH

Included articles were first grouped into those reporting the prevalence of LAL-D, CESD, or WD, in the general population and those reporting the prevalence in specific patient cohorts.

Genetic studies (reporting prevalence derived from LIPA sequencing or pathogenic allele frequency) and epidemiological studies (reporting identification of clinical cases) were assessed separately.

It was also recorded whether studies referred to the prevalence of LAL-D, CESD, and/or WD.

PARAGRAPH

Three prevalence estimates from genetic studies of population cohorts were suitable for meta-analysis using an inverse variance model with a double arcsine transformation.19

Variance was defined as p[1–p]/POP, with POP representing the sample size for genetic studies.

Included studies were assessed for risk of bias using the appraisal tool for cross-sectional studies (AXIS).

PARAGRAPH

Meta-analysis of clinical/epidemiological studies was used to derive a pooled prevalence at birth.

Meta-analysis of genetic studies gave an overall mutant allele frequency, which was used to calculate a prevalence of LAL-D (at birth) via the Hardy-Weinberg equation.

SECTION

Identification of previously reported LIPA variants

PARAGRAPH

A systematic search was performed to identify all previously reported pathogenic variants in LIPA.

The same search of Pubmed/MEDLINE and EMBASE (as described above) was used.

Two independent reviewers screened abstracts to determine suitability for inclusion and disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer.

Inclusion criteria were describing variants in LIPA in humans associated with a loss-of-function and/or LAL-D disease spectrum.

Articles not in English and in vitro or non-human studies were excluded.

Variants reported as disease-causing, pathogenic, probably pathogenic, or harmful were extracted.

PARAGRAPH

In addition, ClinVar (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/, accessed 12/07/2018) was screened for LIPA variants with published reports of pathogenicity and these were added to our list.

Mutations derived from personal communications and without a linked publication were excluded.

PARAGRAPH

Variants were annotated as being associated with WD, CESD, or LAL-D (if both, or not otherwise stated).

PARAGRAPH

Variants were classified on a case by case basis into ‘pathogenic’ and ‘likely pathogenic’ according to ACMG criteria.20

Variants classified as ‘benign’, ‘likely benign’, or of ‘uncertain significance’ were excluded.

(Likely) Pathogenic variants for WD were those found in patients with: hepatic steatosis, raised aminotransferases, reduced LAL activity, and fatal under age 1 (except for cases in a trial of sebelipase alpha); and for CESD as: the presence of hepatic steatosis with dyslipidaemia with reduced LAL activity, with onset over 1 year of age.

In addition to ACMG criteria, variants were classified as ‘likely pathogenic’ if there was no evidence of reduced LAL activity in the affected patients or when there were conflicting reports regarding individual variants.

SECTION

Identification of previously unreported major functional variants in LIPA

PARAGRAPH

Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org/, accessed 12/07/2018) for LIPA transcript ENST00000336233.9 was used to search for all LIPA variants identified in humans via the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC),21 Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), or 1000 Genomes Project (1000G).22

Those with predicted major consequences on protein structure and function were extracted, including: frameshift, premature stop codon, initiator codon, splice donor, splice acceptor, and start loss variants.

The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD, gnomad.broadinstitute.org/, accessed 12/07/2018) was also searched and all duplicates were removed.

Coverage was assessed in gnomAD variants using specific site quality metrics.

Non-PASS filter variants were excluded.

This list of major functional variants was compared with previously reported LIPA variants found in patients to identify unreported variants predicted to affect LAL activity.

Finally, variants underwent frequency filtering.23

SECTION

Annotation of variants with allele frequencies and functional predictions

PARAGRAPH

Coding sequence nucleotide changes for each identified variant were converted to HGVS format (hg38) using Mutalyzer (https://mutalyzer.nl/).

The Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (http://www.ensembl.org/Tools/VEP), was used to annotate variants with SIFT/PolyPhen-2 in silico predictions of pathogenicity and population allele frequencies from the 1000G, ESP, ExAC, and gnomAD data sets.

Where variants had been identified in more than one dataset the larger cohort was used.

SECTION

LIPA structural information and modelling

PARAGRAPH

Data on the domain structure and active site positions for LIPA were extracted from UniProtKB (https://uniprot.org) for P38571.24

Modelling was extracted from ExPasy SWISS-MODEL (https://swissmodel.expasy.org) for P38571, based upon the gastric triacylglycerol lipase.10,25,26

Detail on the exon structure of LIPA was also retrieved from neXtProt (https://nextprot.org).27

SECTION

Prevalence estimation for CESD, WD, and LAL-D

PARAGRAPH

We performed a prevalence estimation without allele frequency filtering to identify the maximum genetic prevalence of LAL-D.

Total allele frequencies were used to calculate estimations of global population prevalence of homozygous and heterozygous LAL-D genotypes using the Hardy-Weinberg equation.

This was performed for: previously reported pathogenic variants (separately for CESD and WD), previously reported pathogenic plus possibly-pathogenic variants, and then previously reported plus unreported major functional variants.

PARAGRAPH

In addition, we estimated the prevalence across 8 different ethnicities.

We calculated 95% CIs for the total allele frequencies using the Wilson score method across a binomial distribution where more than 5 alleles had been identified.

SECTION

Software

PARAGRAPH

Meta-analysis was performed using the Meta-XL add-in for Microsoft Excel (www.epigear.com) and GraphPad Prism version 7.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA, www.graphpad.com.

Results

SECTION

Meta-analysis of previous prevalence estimates

PARAGRAPH

A total of 1,926 abstracts were identified by systematic search, of which 194 studies were included (Fig. S1).

Nine reported the prevalence of WD or CESD in the general population (Table 1), of which 6/9 used clinically identified cases and 3/9 used genetic sequencing of LIPA.

Studies were generally of high quality, with a low risk of bias (Table 1, Fig. S2).

PARAGRAPH

Epidemiological studies were retrospective in nature and predominantly identified patients with WD from national or regional referral centres for inherited metabolic disease.

Prevalences ranged from 1 per 165,530 to 1 per 909,091 (Fig. S3).

Meta-analysis of prevalence estimates using random effects model gave a prevalence of 1 per 451,116 (95% CI 282,022–840,092) with a carrier frequency of 1 per 336 (95% CI 266–458).

PARAGRAPH

All genetic studies used sequencing for c.894G>A in LIPA to generate a pathogenic allele frequency.

Disease prevalence estimates were then calculated using the proportion of pathogenic LIPA variants comprised by c.894G>A (estimated 50–60%, where Scott et al. calculated 95% CI 51–69%).4,34

PARAGRAPH

Meta-analysis of c.894G>A genetic studies using a random effects model gave a pooled allele frequency of 0.0015 (95% CI 0.001–0.002, Fig. 1).

Assuming that c.894G>A accounts for 60% (95% CI 51%–69%)34 of all CESD mutations, this corresponds to a prevalence for CESD of 1 per 160,000 (95% CI 1 per 65,025–761,652) and a carrier frequency of 1 per 400 (95% CI 1 per 255–873).

PARAGRAPH

We also identified 8 studies reporting the prevalence of CESD in specific patient populations: 5 in cohorts of patients with dyslipidaemia (n = 4,193 patients) and 3 in cohorts with liver disease (n = 430, Table S1).

Of these studies, 2/8 (25%) used LIPA sequencing and 6/8 assessed LAL activity.

These data were not suitable for meta-analysis because of significant patient and methodological heterogeneity.

PARAGRAPH

In light of these wide confidence intervals and assumption of pathogenic contribution we then proceeded to attempt to obtain a more accurate estimate of global LAL-D prevalence, using publicly available sequencing data.

SECTION

Identification and analysis of previously reported LIPA variants

PARAGRAPH

After removal of duplicates and benign variants (Fig. S4), 98 disease-causing variants in LIPA were identified from publications (Table S2).

Of these variants, 23/98 (23%) had been associated with WD only, 55/98 (56%) with CESD only, and the remainder with either both or not stated.

Additionally, 36/98 (37%) of variants were classified as pathogenic and the remaining 62/98 (63%) likely pathogenic.

The exonic distribution along LIPA of protein-coding variants and relationship to the active site is shown (Fig. 2).

The most common mutation consequence was missense, accounting for 43% (42/98) of all disease variants (Fig. 3A).

However, this was not evenly distributed across the LAL-D spectrum: WD was associated with a higher proportion of frameshift mutations and premature stop variants (Fig. 3C), compared to CESD (Fig. 3B).

PARAGRAPH

Population databases enabled identification of 32/98 (33%) of disease variants (Table 2); all variants found in ESP, ExAC, or 1000G were also found in gnomAD and therefore only gnomAD allele frequencies are reported.

The most frequently reported allele (E8SJM, c.894G>A) had the highest allele frequency of 0.0089 overall in the gnomAD data set and was notably not found in any individuals of East Asian ancestry.

The 66 variants not identified in gnomAD were in regions with >60× mean depth coverage per base (Fig. S5).

SECTION

Identification and analysis of previously unreported LIPA variants

PARAGRAPH

In order to account for genetic variants that have not yet been identified in patients with LAL-D, we examined all variants that been identified in humans that were predicted to have a significant functional impact on LAL activity (Fig. S6).

We identified 22 previously unreported major functional LIPA variants (Table 3, Fig. 2, Table S3).

The most common functional classification was splice donor or acceptor in 8/22 (36%).

PARAGRAPH

c.894G>A accounted for 49% of the pooled allele frequencies for all 98 previously reported disease-causing variants and 38% of the pooled allele frequencies when including all 120 variants.

The top 4 most frequent LIPA variants (c.894G>A, c.891C>T, c.676-23 T>C, and c.966+3A>T) accounted for 81% of the total allele frequencies for previously reported variants and 61%, when including unreported variants.

SECTION

Estimation of population prevalence of WD, CESD, and LAL-D

PARAGRAPH

Pooling of the allele frequencies for all previously reported disease variants gave a global mutant allele frequency of 0.0018 (95% CI 0.0017–0.002) for LAL-D (Table 4, Fig. 4), which is equivalent to a prevalence at birth of LAL-D of 1 per 307,482 (95% CI 257,672–366,865).

When combined with unreported major functional variants, the pooled allele frequencies increased to 0.0024 (95% CI 0.0022–0.0026), giving a prevalence at birth of LAL-D of 1 per 177,452 (95% CI 149,467–210,683) and a heterozygous carrier rate of 1 per 421 (95% CI 387–459).

Analysis by ethnicity demonstrated a higher prevalence in those of non-Finnish European ancestry: 1 per 103,286 (95% CI 83,142–128, 321), whilst the lowest prevalence of LAL-D was in those of East Asian, Finnish, South Asian, and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry (Fig. 4, Table S4).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

LAL-D (MIM #278000) is recognised as a treatable35 monogenic condition that may masquerade as NAFLD or present with cryptogenic cirrhosis.

Recent data has led to suggestions that it may be under-diagnosed.

In this study we sought to estimate the prevalence of LAL-D using accurate population sequencing data and deepen our understanding of the genetic variation of LIPA.

Using next generation sequencing data, we found LAL-D to affect 1 per 177,452 across the global population, which is significantly lower than previous estimates that have been up to 1 per 40,000.

PARAGRAPH

The main strength of this study is the use of 120 LIPA mutants from a population of >150,000 for our prevalence estimate, whereas previous studies have focussed on c.894G>A (E8SJM).4,34

In doing so, we have also produced a curated list of disease variants in LIPA that may prove useful for further in vitro studies or targeted sequencing in patients.

The majority of these are extremely rare, with 66 of 98 not being identified in any population sequencing cohort, giving an allele frequency of less than 6.7 × 10−6.

PARAGRAPH

Using existing data, we have produced prevalence estimates for CESD and WD separately from LAL-D, however there is conflicting data over the consistency of genotype-phenotype correlations.36–38

These estimates are limited by the difficulty in establishing and reporting clinical diagnoses.

The key differentiating factor is residual activity in LAL, which reliably separates the 2 conditions.12

Although, data in this study supports the notion that WD is more associated with major functional variants (stop gained or splice-site variants).

Our estimate of WD prevalence from genetic variants (1 per 393,630) is slightly higher than the prevalence derived from meta-analysis of previous studies (1 per 451,116, (95% CI 282,022–840,092)).

Given the challenge in diagnosing LAL-D, the disparity between these clinical epidemiological data and the genetic prevalence are most likely to represent under-diagnosis.

The uncertainty associated with these calculations are reflected in their relatively wide confidence intervals.

PARAGRAPH

It is not possible to state whether CESD is under-diagnosed as there are no clinical studies assessing the prevalence of CESD in the general population.

However, targeted testing of LAL activity in >1,800 patients with dyslipidaemia and raised aminotransferases found no affected patients.39

PARAGRAPH

LIPA is a highly conserved gene and its hydrolase domain is similar to other lipases.10

Protein-coding disease variants were found to cluster particularly in exons 4 and 10, in addition to splice junctions.

The active site codons were not found to be affected directly by any point mutations however previous modelling has demonstrated how adjacent variants disrupt LAL activity.40,41

PARAGRAPH

Though this methodology has been used to estimate the prevalence of other monogenic disorders,42 it is based upon the assumptions of the Hardy-Weinberg principle and there is no in vitro data to support many of the variants.

These limitations would be likely to result in an over-estimation of the prevalence of LAL-D in these results.

Our overall calculated prevalence is also limited by an inability to differentiate between WD and CESD in newly discovered variants.

PARAGRAPH

LAL-D is associated with a high proportion of (intronic) splice-site variants.

gnomAD has deep coverage at splice sites (Fig. S6), however this highlights the need for deep exome or whole genome sequencing to diagnose affected patients.

This may be a limitation to incorporating genetic diagnosis into clinical practice.

PARAGRAPH

This updated prevalence estimate has implications for the diagnosis of LAL-D and exclusion of secondary metabolic causes of NAFLD.

EASL-EASD-EASO guidelines recommended that Wilson disease and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency should be tested at an ‘extended investigation’ stage.43

These data suggest that LAL-D is significantly less common than these 2 conditions and therefore could be included in a ‘second-line’ of metabolic tests along with other rare mimics of NAFLD (Fig. S7, Table S5).

A consensus is needed on whether to include LAL-D screening in patients with atypical features of NAFLD – for example, those who are especially young, with a significant family history, low body mass index, or without insulin resistance.

PARAGRAPH

It remains to be established whether heterozygotes have a clinically manifest phenotype and whether 1–5% LAL activity would accelerate concomitant NAFLD, viral hepatitis, or any other hepatic parenchymal disease.

The currently presented data would suggest that the heterozygote carrier rate is much lower than that for other monogenic liver diseases that may influence NAFLD progression, such as HFE hereditary haemochromatosis (1 in 8–10)44 or alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (1 in 15–20).45

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, through comprehensive analysis of genetic variation in LIPA we have expanded our recognition of disease-causing mutants to 120 variants.

LAL-D is an ultra-rare disease, even in its late-onset form as CESD, and these data can help reassure clinicians that LAL-D is unlikely to represent a significant proportion of patients presenting with NAFLD.

A consensus is needed for when testing LAL activity should be performed in patients with dyslipidaemia or hepatic steatosis.
