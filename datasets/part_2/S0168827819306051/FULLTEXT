TITLE

Perioperative omega-3 fatty acids fail to confer protection in liver surgery: Results of a multicentric, double-blind, randomized controlled trial

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Ω3-FAs) are essential nutritional components, whose presence in the human body exclusively depends on its exogenous supply.

In the late 1970s, Bang and Dyerberg observed an extraordinary low incidence of coronary heart disease among Greenland inuits, which was found to be related to a high intake of Ω3-FAs abundant in marine fish; the main food source of this population.1

The liver was subsequently found to be a central metabolic target of Ω3-FAs with growing evidence of their beneficial effects on fatty liver and metabolic syndrome.2–4

Ω3-FAs were found not only to lower intrahepatic lipid contents,5 but also to mitigate inflammatory changes in the liver.6,7

Liver surgery in patients with fatty liver leads to an amplified ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R) and impaired regeneration (LR).8

A variety of animal models disclosed significant liver protection in hepatic surgery (reduction of I/R and improved LR) following treatment with Ω3-FAs.9–11

Of note, these effects were not only observed in steatotic, but also in lean livers.11

For example, in a mouse model, the intravenous (i.v.) administration of a single dose of Ω3-FAs (Omegaven®) prior to liver ischemia dramatically mitigated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon reperfusion.12

This beneficial effect is mediated via the GPR120 receptor located on hepatic Kupffer cells.12

PARAGRAPH

Based on the accumulating evidence in various animal models of Ω3-FAs, including the effective application of single i.v. doses,12 we embarked on an RCT in patients undergoing hepatic surgery.

Considering the safety profile of Ω3-FAs in humans, with their well-established ability to counteract liver steatosis,13 we omitted phase I and II trials, and tested putative benefits of i.v. Ω3-FAs in a phase III trial on early postoperative outcome.

We hypothesized that such an effect would mostly be related to the prevention of ROS release.12

Materials and methods

SECTION

Trial design

PARAGRAPH

We designed a prospective, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trial to test the effect of 2 single i.v. infusions of Omegaven on single (Clavien-Dindo)14 and cumulative (comprehensive complication index [CCI])15 postoperative complications.

The protocol targeted patients undergoing elective liver resection, with resection of at least 1 segment.

This investigator-initiated trial was carried out in 3 liver centers (Bucharest, Romania; Moscow, Russia and Zurich, Switzerland).

SECTION

Patients, study interventions, data collection and monitoring

PARAGRAPH

Eligibility criteria included patients >18 years of age requiring liver resection of at least 1 segment or multiple wedge resections (≥3).

Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are displayed in Table S1.

Patients were randomly assigned (see below) to the Omegaven or placebo (NaCl 0.9%) group in a 1:1 allocation ratio the day before surgery, i.e., just after obtaining informed consent.

Eligible study participants received 100 ml of the blinded study product the evening before surgery and the day of surgery starting with anesthetic induction.

One dose of Omegaven (100 ml) contains 10 g of highly refined fish oil mainly containing eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid.

Care was taken not to exceed the maximum infusion rate of 0.05 g fish oil/kg body weight/h.13

According to standard operating procedures for anesthesia, propofol was avoided as it contains concentrated triglycerides (TGs).

Perioperative source data was collected on site and entered into the electronic case report form (eCRF) of the clinical trial software secuTrial® (Interactive System, Berlin, Germany).

Data monitoring for all 3 participating centers was performed by the Clinical Trial Center Zurich (CTC), Switzerland.

SECTION

Study endpoints

PARAGRAPH

The primary endpoint was morbidity/mortality, as defined by the Clavien-Dindo classification of complications (grade I-V)14 and the related CCI, which integrates the different grades of complications by severity in figures ranging from 0 (uneventful course) to 100 (death).15

Study end was defined at 30 days after hospital discharge.14

All patients who signed the consent were followed up until this time point (Fig. 1).

Secondary endpoints included length of hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) stay, surrogate laboratory parameters of safety including serum levels of TGs, platelets, and international normalized ratio (INR).

Liver-related parameters including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin and creatinine were also collected.

SECTION

Randomization and blinding

PARAGRAPH

A block randomization was used to reduce potential center bias.

As both nurses and surgeons were blinded, 1 study-independent person was responsible for randomization and blinding per center.

This person allocated patients into the Omegaven or placebo group the day before surgery and ensured proper blinding just before the study product was administered.

Blinding was performed using opaque infusion lines and plastic bags to cover the study product.

SECTION

Statistical analysis and sample size

PARAGRAPH

Based on an expected mean of CCI of 17 and 65% of total complications in patients undergoing hepatectomy (cohort of the University Hospital Zurich) we assumed that perioperative continuous i.v. administration of Omegaven may decrease the CCI and/or total complications by 30% (α: 0.05, Power (1-β): 0.8, 2-sided test).

A 30% reduction of complications and CCI was agreed to be a clinically relevant endpoint.

Considering a putative dropout rate of 10%, we determined that a sample size of 129 patients per randomized group (total: n = 258) would be required.

An interim analysis for safety was scheduled after 60 cases.

Final analysis was performed in a univariate setting using Fisher's Exact test for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables.

Continuous variables were expressed as median (IQR), and categorical variables as n (%).

Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were reported when appropriate.

p values <0.05 were considered significant.

All statistical analyses were performed using R Studio version 1.0.44 (RStudio Inc., Boston, MA), IBM SPSS Statistics version 24 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) and Graph Pad Prism version 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA).

Trial registration and ethics

PARAGRAPH

This trial was approved by the Ethical Board of the Canton Zurich (Nr.

2010-0038), notified by Swissmedic (2012DR3215), and registered at ClinicalTrial.gov: ID: NCT01884948.

Local ethics approvals were obtained for Bucharest (Nr.

Results

SECTION

Patient flow and randomization

PARAGRAPH

From July 29, 2013 to July 12, 2018, a total of 261 patients from 3 centers were included in the study and randomly assigned to receive either Omegaven (n = 132) or placebo (n = 129) in 2 doses the day before and during liver surgery.

This patient population depicts the intention-to-treat population.

Patients who completed the study are represented in the per protocol population (Fig. 1).

SECTION

Comparability of Omegaven and placebo groups

PARAGRAPH

Demographics of study participants were similar between treatment groups (Table 1).

In the majority of cases, the indication for liver surgery was malignant liver tumors (90% and 93%), with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) the leading entity in both the Omegaven (27%) and placebo (34%) groups.

Benign tumors were the indication for surgery in 14% and 12% of cases, respectively, while the other most common indications included Echinococcus (29% vs. 35% in the Omegaven and placebo groups, respectively) and living donor liver transplantation (25% vs. 30% in the Omegaven and placebo groups, respectively).

Overall, the utilization of inflow occlusion during transection was similarly distributed (29% vs. 28%) in the treatment groups with a comparable median Pringle time of 18 vs. 16 min (Table 1).

SECTION

Treatment procedures and patient dropout

PARAGRAPH

After randomization patients were allocated to receive either Omegaven (n = 132) or placebo (n = 129) (Fig. 1).

Both, randomization and allocation to the respective trial drug occurred without errors during the study period, as proper study instruction was performed beforehand.

After commencing infusion the evening before liver surgery, no adverse effects (anaphylactic reaction, gastrointestinal disorders, headache, rash etc.)13 were recorded.

Likewise, the second infusion starting at anesthetic induction revealed no adverse effects.

The dropout rate was 15% in the Omegaven group and 12% in the placebo group.

This was slightly higher than the assumed dropout rate of 10% in both groups.

Most dropouts occurred at the time of laparotomy and exploration of the situs.

In 13% and 10% of cases the tumor could not be resected due to the presence of more diffuse disease including extrahepatic tumor spread.

In 2 and 3 cases in the respective groups, surgery was converted to an ALPPS (associating liver partition and portal vein ligation) procedure.

These patients were excluded in the protocol due to the second stage surgery occurring within the study period.

Overall, in 6 cases the second dose of the study product was not administered intraoperatively due to a communication error.

One patient in each group refused to follow-up after study product application (Fig. 1).

Otherwise patients were successfully followed up until the study end 1 month after hospital discharge.

SECTION

Safety monitoring

PARAGRAPH

Restrictive inclusion and exclusion criteria, particularly focusing on potentially impaired blood coagulation were an important feature of this study (Table S1).

Therefore only 13% of all screened patients could finally be included in the study (Fig. 1).

An interim analysis was carried out after inclusion of the initial 60 patients (Omegaven, n = 31; Placebo, n = 29).

Mortality and severe complications (≥IIIb) were 2 (7%) and 4 (13%) in the Omegaven and 1 (3%) and 4 (14%) in the placebo group (p = 0.60 and p = 0.92).

Consistently, CCI and the presence of any complications did not differ between the groups, 22 (±26) and 20 (64%) vs. 20 (±25) and 15 (52%) (p = 0.68 and 0.32).

The interim analysis therefore revealed no safety issues, which meant that the study could be completed.

As Omegaven can lead to a prolonged bleeding time and inhibited platelet aggregation in rare cases,13 blood samples were obtained so that coagulation parameters (including INR and platelet count) 1 h after the start of study product infusion could be compared to baseline values (Fig. 2C,D).

SECTION

Mortality and morbidity

PARAGRAPH

The mortality rate within the study period was 4% and 2% in the Omegaven and placebo groups (OR 0.40; 95% CI 0.04–2.51; p = 0.45), respectively.

Any complications and major complications (Clavien-Dindo ≥ IIIb) occurred in 46% vs. 43% (OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.53–1.50; p = 0.709) and 12% vs. 10% (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.34–1.89; p = 0.69) of patients in the Omegaven and placebo groups, respectively.

The mean CCI was 17 (±23) vs.14 (±20) (p = 0.42) (Table 2 and Fig. 2A).

Most severe complications were cardiac-related, leading to 3 mortalities in the Omegaven group, 3 patients experienced septic shock and consequent organ failure and 1 patient developed a kinking of the portal vein after a right hemi-hepatectomy leading to lethal liver failure.

A code break by the principle investigator for unblinding mortalities was performed in 4 cases.

Overall, biliary, infectious and other complications were the most common complications.

Biliary and infectious complications occurred in 10% and 11% in the Omegaven, and 5% and 12% in the placebo groups (p = 0.15 and 0.85; Table 2), respectively.

A per protocol analysis (Fig. 1) did not reveal a different outcome (Table S2).

PARAGRAPH

Subgroup analysis with only patients undergoing major hepatectomy (≥3 segments) showed a mortality of 7% vs. 3% in the Omegaven and placebo group (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.03–2.25; p = 0.26).

Any complication and major complications in this subgroup occurred in 57% vs. 53% and 19% vs. 11% in the Omegaven and placebo groups (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.41–1.69; p = 0.62 and OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.17–1.46; p = 0.24), respectively.

The subgroup analysis for only patients with inflow occlusion (Pringle maneuver), as a potential source of I/R, did not reveal a different outcome for the treatment groups.

Mortality was 6 vs. 3% (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.01–9.27; p = 0.609) in the Omegaven and placebo groups, respectively.

Any complication occurred in 53% in both treatment groups (OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.35–2.81; p = 1.00), and major complications in 15% and 8% (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.076–3.01; p = 0.47), respectively.

SECTION

Effects of Omegaven on laboratory parameters

PARAGRAPH

After application of the first dose of study medication, median triglyceride levels rose by 45 vs. 9 mg/dl in the Omegaven and placebo groups, respectively, and stayed in this range after application of the second dose (p < 0.001, Fig. 2B).

No significant differences were noted for platelets and INR (Fig. 2C,D).

Peak median ALT and AST levels appeared slightly increased, although not reaching statistical significance, in the Omegaven treatment group (332 and 363 vs. 318 and 305 U/L in the placebo group) (Fig. 3A,B), bilirubin and creatine levels appeared unaffected.

SECTION

Potential Omegaven-related side effects

PARAGRAPH

The study represents a clinical phase III trial testing Omegaven for a new indication.

But side effects of Omegaven are already well characterized.13

Omegaven is contra-indicated for patients with a recent myocardial infarction.

Though none of the patients included in the study experienced a myocardial infarction in the last months before surgery, 3 mortalities in the Omegaven group were attributable to cardiac events after surgery (Table 3).

The placebo group in contrast revealed no lethal cardiac events (p = 0.25).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial including 261 patients, perioperative administration of Ω3-FAs did not confer a reduction in postoperative complications after liver surgery.

These results are in contrast to a variety of animal studies reporting marked reductions of I/R injuries9,12 and improved liver regeneration in both steatotic and lean livers10,11.

In the current trial, these exciting experimental observations were not confirmed by our observations in patients, using markers of postoperative morbidity – the most meaningful primary endpoint of harm in surgery.

PARAGRAPH

Although the liver-defattening effects of Ω3-FAs,17 including evidence for some anti-cancer effects,11,18,19 have been investigated for a while, there is little available information on the clinical use of Ω3-FAs in the context of liver surgery.

Previous reports have suggested that oral supplementation of Ω3-FAs for 4 weeks reduces intrahepatic lipid content in preparation for bariatric surgery20 and living donor liver transplantation.21

Just prior to the initiation of this RCT, another RCT showed that parenteral use of Ω3-FA supplementation for 7 consecutive days after liver transplantation was associated with a reduction in infectious complications and shorter hospitalization time.22

During the recruitment period of this trial, 3 RCTs looking at different outcomes after perioperative Ω3-FA supplementation in liver surgery were published.23–25

One study reported the use of a 20% Ω3-FA emulsion of 7 ml/kg once a day for 2 days before and at the day of living donor hepatectomy, which was associated with improved liver regeneration 1 month after surgery, as measured by liver volumetry.24

The second trial from China reported reduced overall mortality and length of hospital stay with the use of continuous Ω3-FA parenteral supplementation vs. standard parenteral nutrition for 5 days postoperatively in cirrhotic patients undergoing hepatectomy for cancer.25

Similarly, the third trial, also from China, looked at postoperative complications following a 5-day course of postoperative intravenous Ω3-FA supplementation after hepatectomy, revealing a reduction of total postoperative complications and length of hospital stay.23

These studies are in contrast with the results of the current RCT.

The major issues with these studies may lie in the lack of consistency regarding the forms of Ω3-FA application and doses, as well as inhomogeneous patient cohorts, and eventually different primary endpoints.

The study in living liver donors,24 for example, focused on volumetrically measured liver growth rather than complications.

The other study left patients for 5 days on parenteral nutrition with Omegaven as supplementation in the treatment group.23

This might introduce a major bias as parenteral nutrition (comparator) is well known to harm liver function and Omegaven is approved for reducing this harm.

Of note, none of these studies tried to investigate the different effects of Ω3-FA.

It is therefore difficult to interpret those studies, particularly whether the observed positive effects of Ω3-FA relate to their antioxidative vs. defattening properties.

PARAGRAPH

The current study, using 2 perioperative i.v. doses, focused on the putative antioxidative/anti-inflammatory effects rather than a beneficial effect through defattening, which obviously could not occur during this short period.

We chose this protocol relating to the strong antioxidant effects observed in previous laboratory works from our9,11,12,26 and other10,27–29 groups, and accordingly did not restrict the study to patients with liver steatosis.

Perioperative doses also prevent well-known issues with compliance of patients in taking medication.

In addition, patients scheduled for liver surgery mainly present with malignant tumor (90%); often making it difficult to impose a preparation for surgery lasting for weeks.

Like this trial, other RCTs tested different antioxidant/anti-inflammatory compounds, which showed promising results in experimental studies of liver surgery but failed to translate its beneficial effect into clinics.

For example, the perioperative application of N-acetylcysteine (1 dose), could not reduce postoperative complications after liver surgery in an RCT of 206 patients.30

Moreover, the perioperative treatment with steroids (3 doses) also failed to reduce postoperative complications after liver surgery in an RCT of 210 patients.31

This data strongly suggests that mitigation of inflammation is obviously insufficient to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications after hepatic surgery.

PARAGRAPH

Morbidity and mortality did not show any difference, including in the subgroup analyses of patients undergoing major liver surgery and those with inflow occlusion.

Although not reaching statistical difference, 3 out of 5 mortalities in the Omegaven group were attributable to acute cardiac events, although pre-existing cardiac disease was an exclusion criterion (Table 2).

Thus, such side effects of Omegaven cannot be excluded.13

This is an interesting observation as the long-term Ω3-FA intake as a food supplement, in contrast, leads to cardioprotection.1

We could speculate that the documented rise in serum TG levels in patients subjected to i.v. Ω3-FA in this study might be related to cardiac events.

PARAGRAPH

The strength of this study is its methodology providing the highest level of evidence.

This placebo-controlled RCT is testing a clear-cut, clinical question and guarantees the highest possible standards to minimize bias.

Many patients in the liver resection population, however, could not be included due to the stringent exclusion criteria for safety reasons, resulting in a final inclusion of only 13% of patients screened (Fig. 1).

Both, inclusion and exclusion criteria were chosen restrictively (Table S1) to meet the highest possible safety standard for a phase III trial.

PARAGRAPH

There are a number of limitations in this RCT.

A positive effect could have been masked by the heterogeneity of the patients enrolled.

A stratification of procedures with different complication profiles could potentially lead to a better discrimination of Omegaven effects.

A further problem is that the doses applied might be too low, but higher doses of Omegaven are clearly not recommended due to the risk of side effects.13

The dose recommendation of 10 g Ω3-FAs per application was strictly followed.13

For this reason phase I or II trials to define optimal dosing would not have impacted the design of this study.

Bioavailability was documented by the rise of blood TG levels perioperatively.

Another limitation is that the study end was set 30 days after hospital discharge,14 which could be insufficient to detect the whole spectrum of complications.

Certainly, most early occurring complications, which may result from I/R and impaired LR may be recorded in this time period.

In addition, center volume and slightly different surgical techniques for hepatic resection could potentially impact on results, although a block randomization was performed to distribute cases equally between the centers.

PARAGRAPH

In summary, this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial failed to reduce postoperative complications using 2 i.v. doses of Ω3-FAs (100 ml Omegaven).

This finding is in contrast to experimental and clinical findings disclosing many beneficial effects.

Like other anti-inflammatory compounds (e.g. N-acetylcysteine and steroids) i.v. use of Ω3-FAs is not recommended perioperatively in liver surgery.

However, this does not apply to the liver-defattening properties related to the long-term use of oral Ω3-FAs.
