ABSTRACT

TITLE

Perioperative omega-3 fatty acids fail to confer protection in liver surgery: Results of a multicentric, double-blind, randomized controlled trial

PARAGRAPH

In a variety of animal models, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Ω3-FAs) conferred strong protective effects, alleviating hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury and steatosis, as well as enhancing regeneration after major tissue loss.

Given these benefits along with its safety profile, we hypothesized that perioperative administration of Ω3-FAs in patients undergoing liver surgery may ameliorate the postoperative course.

The aim of this study was to investigate the perioperative use of Ω3-FAs to reduce postoperative complications after liver surgery.

PARAGRAPH

Between July 2013 and July 2018, we carried out a multicentric, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial designed to test whether 2 single intravenous infusions of Omegaven® (Ω3-FAs) vs. placebo may decrease morbidity.

The primary endpoints were postoperative complications by severity (Clavien-Dindo classification) integrated within the comprehensive complication index (CCI).

PARAGRAPH

A total of 261 patients (132 in the Omegaven and 129 in the placebo groups) from 3 centers were included in the trial.

Most cases (87%, n = 227) underwent open liver surgery and 56% (n = 105) were major resections (≥3 segments).

In an intention-to-treat analysis including the dropout cases, the mortality rate was 4% and 2% in the Omegaven and placebo groups (odds ratio 0.40; 95% CI 0.04–2.51; p = 0.447), respectively.

Any complications and major complications (Clavien-Dindo ≥ 3b) occurred in 46% vs. 43% (p = 0.709) and 12% vs. 10% (p = 0.69) in the Omegaven and placebo groups, respectively.

The mean CCI was 17 (±23) vs.14 (±20) (p = 0.417).

An analysis excluding the dropouts provided similar results.

PARAGRAPH

The routine perioperative use of 2 single doses of intravenous Ω3-FAs (100 ml Omegaven) cannot be recommended in patients undergoing liver surgery (Grade A recommendation).
