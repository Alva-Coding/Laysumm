TITLE

Evolution of eGFR in chronic HCV patients receiving sofosbuvir-based or sofosbuvir-free direct acting antivirals

PARAGRAPH

While the efficacy of sofosbuvir for the treatment of hepatitis C virus is clear, data regarding its possible nephrotoxicity are controversial.

Herein, we showed that sofosbuvir worsened on-treatment kidney function but led to an off-treatment improvement.

Our findings suggest that treating physicians should be alert to risk factors for kidney dysfunction before initiating direct-acting antiviral treatment for patients with hepatitis C virus infection.
