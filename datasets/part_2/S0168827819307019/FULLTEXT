TITLE

Evolution of eGFR in chronic HCV patients receiving sofosbuvir-based or sofosbuvir-free direct acting antivirals

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major health problem which affects 71 million people worldwide.1

Patients with chronic HCV infection may present with various hepatic and extrahepatic manifestations that lead to substantial morbidity and mortality.2-5

In contrast, the long-term health outcome improves following successful HCV eradication by antiviral therapies.6-8

PARAGRAPH

Owing to the excellent efficacy and safety as well as the short treatment duration, the use of interferon (IFN)-free direct acting antivirals (DAAs) has become the standard-of-care for managing HCV.9

Sofosbuvir (SOF) is a pyrimidine nucleotide analogue which acts as the HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) chain terminator by inhibiting HCV non-structural protein 5B (NS5B) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase following intrahepatic activation to uridine triphosphate form.10

Dephosphorylation results in the formation of inactive metabolite (GS-331007) that undergoes extensive renal excretion.

Clinically, SOF is administered once-daily with pangenotypic potency and well tolerability, and has a high genetic barrier to viral resistance.

Furthermore, SOF can be used in combination with NS3/4A protease inhibitors (PIs), NS5A inhibitors, and/or ribavirin (RBV) to achieve high sustained virologic response (SVR) rates.

Therefore, applying SOF-based DAAs for HCV is welcome to most treating physicians.

PARAGRAPH

Following the widespread use of SOF-based DAAs for treating HCV in different populations, a large-scale real-world HCV-TARGET study enrolling 1,789 patients indicated that patients with a baseline eGFR ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73m2 were associated with a higher risk of worsening renal function than those with a baseline eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.73m2 after receiving SOF-based DAAs.11

Moreover, three retrospective studies showed that SOF-based DAAs negatively affected the on-treatment and off-therapy eGFR.12-14

On the contrary, other studies showed that the use of SOF-based DAAs did not worsen eGFR.15-18

Because most studies were retrospective in nature without patient selection or protocol-defined time point for eGFR assessment, and did not enroll patients receiving SOF-free DAAs to serve as the controls, we thus conducted a prospective study in patients with chronic HCV infection receiving SOF-based or SOF-free DAAs to assess the association between the use of SOF and potential nephrotoxicity.

Patients

PARAGRAPH

Between February 2015 and July 2018, patients with chronic HCV infection who received SOF-based or SOF-free DAAs with or without RBV for 12 weeks at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) and NTUH Yun-Lin Branch were prospectively enrolled.

The use of DAA regimens was based on physicians’ discretion.

Chronic HCV infection was defined as detectable HCV antibody (anti-HCV; Abbott HCV EIA 2.0, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA) and quantifiable serum HCV RNA (Cobas TaqMan HCV Test v2.0, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany, lower limit of quantification [LLOQ]: 15 IU/mL) for ≥ 6 months.

Patients were excluded from the study if they had decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B or C), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73m2, active HCC or organ transplantation, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, or if they refused to provide informed consent.

The study was approved by NTUH Ethics Committee and was conducted in accordance with the principles of Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization for Good Clinical Practice.

All patients provided written informed consent before enrollment.

SECTION

Study Design

PARAGRAPH

Baseline patients’ demographics, including age, sex, history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), body mass index (BMI), and use of concomitant nephrotoxic agents were collected.

Hemogram, international normalized ratio (INR), serum albumin, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, anti-HCV, HBV surface antigen (Abbott Architect HBsAg qualitative assay, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA), anti-HIV (Abbott Architect HIV Ag/Ab Combo, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA), HCV RNA, HCV genotype (Abbott RealTime HCV Genotype II, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA) were assessed for all patients.19

Cirrhosis was determined by liver biopsy showing F4 stage fibrosis by METAVIR score or by liver stiffness measurement (LSM, FibroScan®, Echosens, Paris, France) showing > 12.5 kPa.20

PARAGRAPH

Patients received eGFR assessment at baseline, on-treatment weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 (end-of-treatment), and off-therapy weeks 4, 8, 12 and 24.

The eGFR was assessed by chronic kidney disease-epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation.21

SECTION

Statistical Analyses

PARAGRAPH

Statistical Program for Social Sciences (SPSS Statistics Version 23.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.

The baseline patient characteristics were shown in mean (standard deviation, SD) and percentages, and were compared by independent-samples t-test and χ2 with Fisher’s exact test when appropriate.

According to the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, the eGFR changes in patients receiving SOF-based and SOF-free DAAs from baseline to treatment week 12 and from baseline to SVR24 were graded as > -50%, -50% to -30%, -30% to -10%, -10% to 10%, 10% to 30%, 30% to 50% and > 50%.22

The grade distributions were shown in percentages and compared by χ2 with Fisher’s exact test.

The eGFR evolution from baseline to off-therapy week 24 (SVR24) was shown by estimated slope coefficient (mL/min/1.73m2/month).

Generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) is an extension of generalized linear model (GLM) in which the linear predictor contains random effects in addition to the usual fixed effects.

This model can analyze an outcome which is measured more than once on the same subjects (repeated measures taken over time).

Furthermore, it can analyze grouped data over time, since the differences between groups can be modelled as a random effect.23

We showed the estimated unadjusted slope coefficient differences in three different periods (on-treatment, off-therapy, and the whole study period) by GLMM for age, sex, BMI, history of DM, HTN, baseline CKD stage, cirrhosis, HCV viral load and genotype, use of nephrotoxic agents, SOF-based DAAs or RBV with 95% confidence interval (CI).24

Factors with a p value < 0.10 by unadjusted analysis entered adjusted analysis to search for independent factors associated with eGFR decline.

Furthermore, we assessed the slope coefficient differences in patients receiving SOF-based or SOF-free DAAs according to baseline CKD stage.

All statistics were two-tailed and the results were considered statistically significant when a p value was < 0.05.

Patient Characteristics

PARAGRAPH

Of 684 chronic HCV patients receiving IFN-free DAAs for 12 weeks, 203 were excluded from the study because of decompensated cirrhosis (n =12), eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2 (n = 74), active HCC (n = 3), organ transplantation (n = 26), HBV coinfection (n = 18), HIV coinfection (n = 66) or refusal to provide informed consent (n = 4).

The remaining 481 patients, including 308 and 173 patients receiving SOF-based and SOF-free DAAs were enrolled and included in the study, respectively (Fig. 1).

PARAGRAPH

Table 1 shows the baseline patient characteristics.

Patients receiving SOF-based DAAs were younger, had lower proportions of BMI > 23 kg/m2, HTN, HCV genotype 1 infection and cirrhosis, had higher proportions of RBV use and HCV RNA level > 6,000,000 IU/mL than patients receiving SOF-free DAAs.

The baseline eGFR and CKD stage distributions as well as the use of nephrotoxic agents were comparable between patients receiving SOF-based and SOF-free DAAs.

PARAGRAPH

Six (1.2%) of the 481 patients who were lost to follow-up did not have SVR12 data.

The SVR12 rates of the remaining 475 patients who received SOF-based and SOF-free DAAs were 98.1% and 98.3%, respectively.

Fifty-seven (1.1%) of the scheduled 5,291 eGFR tests missed assessment.

PARAGRAPH

Changes of eGFR by DAIDS Grading System during the Study Period in Patients Receiving SOF-based or SOF-free DAAs

PARAGRAPH

In patients receiving SOF-based DAAs, 69.7% and 71.9% of them had eGFR changes within the range of ±10% from baseline to on-treatment week 12 and from baseline to SVR24.

In patients receiving SOF-free DAAs, 84.9% and 84.9% of them had eGFR changes within the range of ±10% from baseline to on-treatment week 12 and from baseline to SVR24.

Compared to patients receiving SOF-free DAAs, those receiving SOF-based DAAs had more significant eGFR decline from baseline to on-treatment week 12 (p < 0.001) or from baseline to SVR24 (p = 0.001) (Fig. 2A and 2B).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The potential nephrotoxicity of SOF has been controversial since its widespread use for HCV therapy.

Prior studies recruited patients with heterogeneous background and treatment duration, which might complicate the analysis of nephrotoxicity for SOF.

In this study, we excluded patients with decompensated cirrhosis and those with CKD stage 4 or 5 because they may bias the physicians’ discretion for DAA regimens.

Furthermore, we also excluded patients with HBV or HIV coinfection, or those receiving organ transplantation because the antiviral agents for HBV and HIV, as well as the immunosuppressive agents have potential nephrotoxicity which may also bias the physicians’ preference for DAA regimens.13,25,26

Because many factors, including age, sex, BMI, presence of DM, HTN and cirrhosis, HCV RNA level, HCV genotype, and the concomitant use of nephrotoxic agents, may also affect eGFR, we analyzed the effects of these factors on eGFR decline.

Finally, we chose patients receiving SOF-free DAAs as the controls and patients receiving 12 weeks of therapy for unbiased comparison.

By repeated on-treatment and off-therapy eGFR assessment with only 1.1% missing data, our prospective study showed that in addition to increasing age and more advanced CKD stage, the use of SOF-based DAAs was independently associated with a trend for eGFR decline.

PARAGRAPH

In accordance with previous studies which included patients receiving both SOF-based and SOF-free DAAs, we confirmed that the on-treatment and the overall eGFR declines were more significant in patients receiving SOF-based DAAs, compared to patients receiving SOF-free DAAs.12,14,17

Our data were also in line with studies recruiting patients receiving only SOF-based DAAs that the mean eGFR levels with 95% confidence bound were comparable at baseline, on-treatment week 12 and off-therapy week 24.15,16,18

However, in contrast to a linear trend of eGFR improvement in patients receiving SOF-free DAAs, the eGFR evolution in patients receiving SOF-based DAAs showed a quadratic trend presenting with on-treatment decline and off-therapy recovery.

When we evaluated the grade of eGFR changes by DAIDS grading system, patients receiving SOF-based DAAs also had a significantly higher risk of eGFR decline than patients receiving SOF-free DAAs, albeit about 70% of our patients receiving SOF-based DAAs had no clinically significant eGFR changes.

Taken together, the different trends of eGFR changes in our patients receiving SOF-based and SOF-free DAAs suggested that the use of SOF-based DAAs may potentially be nephrotoxic, but the effect tended to be improved after stopping treatment.

Moreover, the eGFR levels at SVR12 and SVR24 tended to be higher than baseline eGFR level, irrespectively of DAA regimens, which can be explained by the beneficial effects on renal function following HCV eradication in more than 98% of our patients.27-29

The underlying mechanisms of nephrotoxicity in patients receiving SOF-based DAAs remain unclear.

Recent studies revealed that the use of SOF was associated with dose-independent drug-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis.30-33

Furthermore, SOF covalently inhibits liver, kidney and intestinal carboxylesterase-2 (CES-2), and may potentiate concomitant nephrotoxic drugs that share the same transporter.34

Further experimental studies on pharmacotoxicology are needed to unravel the association between SOF and nephrotoxicity.

PARAGRAPH

Due to various ischemic, toxic, immunologic or infectious injuries, our study confirmed the well-known risk factors, such as the increasing age, DM, HTN, and baseline CKD stage, were associated with eGFR decline,.35-38

However, DM and HTN did not show significance in multivariate analysis, which can be reasoned by the collinearity of these factors with baseline CKD stage.

When the patients’ baseline CKD stage were taken into consideration, we found that the age-adjusted slope coefficient differences of eGFR between SOF-based and SOF-free DAAs were significantly different in patients with baseline CKD stage 1 or 2, rather than CKD stage 3.

This finding implies the eGFR improvement after HCV suppression by SOF-free DAAs tends to be non-significant in patients with baseline CKD stage 3, where extensive glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis already exist.39

When we compared the eGFR changes during and after stopping DAAs, the proportions of worsening eGFR were higher in patients receiving SOF-based DAAs than those receiving SOF-free DAAs.

Therefore, the physicians should judiciously choose the DAA regimens in HCV patients with old age and more advanced CKD stage to minimize the risk of renal function deterioration.11,12,40,41

PARAGRAPH

Because there were still confounding factors that may affect the eGFR, our study was limited by the lack of investigation for disease control status for DM and HTN, as well as for the potential dehydration in our patients.

There might be some biases due to the lack of randomization for DAA therapy or propensity based score matching of patients.

We did not measure the cystatin C level, which has been considered a better index than conventional creatinine-based eGFR for renal function assessment, to confirm our observations.

Finally, we did not check urinalysis in our patients with significant eGFR declines to assess the potential etiology or mechanism of renal damage.

PARAGRAPH

In summary, our prospective study indicated that increasing age, use of SOF-based DAAs, and more advanced CKD stage were independently associated with eGFR decline in chronic HCV patients receiving IFN-free DAAs.
