TITLE

Epidemiology and natural history of hepatitis C virus infection among children and young people

PARAGRAPH

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global health problem, which can now be treated with potent direct-acting antiviral drugs.

This study demonstrates that HCV infection in childhood causes serious liver disease in 32% of patients, a median of 33â€¯years after infection, irrespective of age, mode and route of infection.

Disease outcomes were better in patients treated before the development of advanced liver disease.

Antiviral therapy should be made available in childhood to prevent long-term liver disease and the spread of HCV.
