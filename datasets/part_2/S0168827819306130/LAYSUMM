TITLE

Î²-Klotho gene variation is associated with liver damage in children with NAFLD

PARAGRAPH

Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on the pathogenesis and progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.

The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of a genetic variant in the KLB gene on the severity of liver disease.

Our data suggest that the KLB protein plays a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.
