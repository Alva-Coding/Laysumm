TITLE

Cardiopulmonary hemodynamics and C-reactive protein as prognostic indicators in compensated and decompensated cirrhosis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Cirrhosis represents the end-stage of chronic liver disease, with a course characterized by a transition from an asymptomatic compensated stage to a symptomatic decompensated stage.1

These stages have entirely different mortalities and should therefore be considered distinct entities.

Decompensation is defined by the development of overt clinical complications of cirrhosis: ascites, variceal hemorrhage (VH), encephalopathy, and jaundice.1

PARAGRAPH

Decompensation is mainly driven by portal hypertension (PH), with a portal pressure, as determined by the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), ≥10 mmHg.2

Therefore, compensated cirrhosis has been recently sub-staged into mild PH (HVPG >5 but <10 mmHg) and clinically significant portal hypertension ([CSPH] HVPG ≥10 mmHg).2,3

The latter subgroup has in turn been sub-classified into those with or without gastroesophageal varices (GEV), because patients with compensated cirrhosis and GEV have a higher risk of decompensation and death, compared to those without GEV.4

PARAGRAPH

The most frequent decompensating event in cirrhosis and the one that carries the highest mortality risk is ascites.5,6

Unlike VH and encephalopathy, ascites is a progressive complication that results most directly from a splanchnic venous pooling in the upright posture, which triggers sodium and water retention.7

Shear stress-induced splanchnic arterial vasodilation then appears in the supine position because of blood volume redistribution and cardiac output increase (i.e. vasodilation hypothesis and hyperdynamic circulatory state).7

Worsening of this state leads to a stage of “further” decompensation, characterized by refractory ascites.8

PARAGRAPH

Translocation of bacterial or pathogen-associated molecules from the intestinal lumen to the systemic circulation and extraintestinal organs, has been associated with the hyperdynamic circulatory state of advanced experimental and human cirrhosis through an increased production of proinflammatory cytokines.9–11

A recent paper12 has de-emphasized the importance of the vasodilation hypothesis in favor of a systemic inflammatory response as the predominant mechanism in decompensated cirrhosis and in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), but has recommended the performance of studies assessing the relationship among clinical stages, splanchnic and systemic hemodynamics and systemic inflammation.

PARAGRAPH

The aim of this study was to assess systemic and hepatic hemodynamics and systemic inflammation at each of the five sub-stages of cirrhosis (three in compensated cirrhosis,3 two in decompensated cirrhosis) and to investigate their relative impact on decompensation (in those with compensated cirrhosis) and death/liver transplant (in those with decompensated cirrhosis).

SECTION

Patients and methods

PARAGRAPH

The study is a single center cohort study in which consecutive patients evaluated at the Hepatic Hemodynamic Laboratory at the Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria in Modena, Italy, between March 2013 and August 2015 were considered for enrollment.

Patients referred to this laboratory are those with clinically diagnosed cirrhosis followed at the outpatient Liver Clinics or in the inpatient services (compensated patients were mainly outpatients; about 60% of decompensated patients were recruited while hospitalized for difficult to treat/refractory ascites, pre-orthotopic liver transplant [OLT] workup or hepatic encephalopathy).

PARAGRAPH

Hemodynamic assessment was performed in the setting of two ongoing prospective studies approved by the local Ethics Committee: the first looking at predictors of first decompensation (NCT03084185); the second looking at clinical and molecular predictors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in both compensated and decompensated patients (NCT03083002).

These studies require baseline testing and prospective follow-up.

Patients sign consent to participate in the study.

SECTION

Patients

PARAGRAPH

Inclusion criteria were presence of cirrhosis (based on clinical, biochemical, elastographic, imaging and/or histological criteria) and a HVPG >5 mmHg.

PARAGRAPH

Exclusion criteria were: age below 18 and above 75 years, factors that would impact prognosis and/or hemodynamics (HCC, ACLF, including alcoholic hepatitis, sepsis or active infections), previous transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement, treatment with non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB) in compensated patients, cholestatic liver disease, active heavy alcohol intake, occlusive portal vein thrombosis, HIV co-infection, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis post-liver transplant, hepatopulmonary syndrome, portopulmonary hypertension, heart failure as defined by an ejection fraction <55%, non-cirrhotic PH, and failure to sign informed consent.

All eligible patients underwent hepatic and cardiac hemodynamic assessment.

HVPG values, presence of non-cirrhotic PH and portopulmonary hypertension were defined at the time of hemodynamic assessment.

PARAGRAPH

Patients were defined as having compensated cirrhosis in the absence of clinically overt ascites, overt encephalopathy, VH or jaundice.

We defined patients as having decompensated cirrhosis in the presence of ascites as this is the most common non-episodic event and the one with the highest mortality.5–7

Patients with a remote history of VH as the only decompensating event were not considered decompensated because, once VH resolves, patients return to a compensated stage.3

Patients with overt encephalopathy in the absence of other decompensating events were not seen in this cohort.

PARAGRAPH

Patients with compensated cirrhosis were sub-classified into three clinical prognostic stages (PS)3 based on the presence of the following:

PS1, mild PH (HVPG >5 mmHg but <10 mmHg)

PS2, CSPH (HVPG ≥10 mmHg) without GEV

PS3, GEV (by definition, with CSPH).

PARAGRAPH

Patients with decompensated cirrhosis were sub-classified into two clinical prognostic stages:13

PS4, diuretic-responsive ascites with or without a remote VH or hepatic encephalopathy

PS5, refractory ascites, defined according to the International Ascites Club,14 with or without a remote history of VH or hepatic encephalopathy

SECTION

Routine assessments

PARAGRAPH

Routine laboratory tests including liver enzymes/function and cell blood counts were obtained.

Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) scores were calculated.

Ultrasound to screen for HCC and portal vein thrombosis was obtained within one month prior to hemodynamic evaluation; upper endoscopy to screen for GEV was performed during the same admission as hemodynamic evaluation.

SECTION

Hemodynamic evaluation

PARAGRAPH

Performed after an overnight fast and under mild sedation with intravenous midazolam (0.02 mg/kg).

PS5 patients with grade 2–3 ascites underwent large volume paracentesis (LVP) and intravenous albumin15 the day before the hemodynamic procedure.

Most patients with ascites were taking diuretics until the day prior to the procedure.

Weight and height were recorded before starting the procedure to calculate the body surface area (BSA).

After local anesthesia, a venous introducer was placed in the right internal jugular vein following the Seldinger technique.

During the entire procedure, heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured every five minutes with an automatic sphygmomanometer (Marquette Electronics, Milwaukee, WI).

SECTION

Cardiopulmonary hemodynamics

PARAGRAPH

Cardiopulmonary pressures were measured under fluoroscopy as already described.16

Right atrial pressure (RAP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm) and mean pulmonary artery wedged pressure (PAWP) were recorded electronically (PowerLab, ADI Instruments, Milford, MA, USA) and analyzed using dedicated software (LabChart 7, ADI Instruments, Milford, MA, USA).

Cardiac output (CO) was determined by the on-line thermo dilution method (Marquette Electronics, Milwaukee, WI).

Cardiac index (CI = CO/BSA), stroke volume index (SVI = CI/HR), left ventricular stroke work index [LVSWI = SVI × (MAP − PAWP) × 0.0136], systemic vascular resistance index [SVRI = ((MAP–RAP)/CI) * 80], pulmonary vascular resistance index [PVRI = [((mPAP − PAWP)/CI) * 80] were calculated.

Post-capillary pulmonary hypertension (pcPH) due to left ventricular dysfunction was defined as a PAPm ≥25 mmHg associated with a PAWP >15 mmHg.17,18

SECTION

HVPG measurement

PARAGRAPH

After cardiopulmonary parameters were measured, a balloon catheter (Edwards Lifesciences™, Irvine, CA, USA) was introduced into the main right or medium supra-hepatic vein via the inferior vena cava (IVC) for measurements of the wedged hepatic vein pressure (WHVP) and the free hepatic venous pressure (FHVP) as previously described.16

Permanent tracings were electronically recorded (PowerLab, ADI Instruments, Milford, MA, USA) and analyzed by dedicated software (LabChart 7, ADI Instruments, Milford, MA, USA).

The HVPG was obtained by subtracting the FHVP at junction with IVC from the WHVP.

PARAGRAPH

All hemodynamic assessments were performed in triplicate.

SECTION

Inflammatory marker

PARAGRAPH

C-reactive protein (CRP), the most common marker of systemic inflammation, was per protocol assessed in sera of all patients by a commercially available test (CRPL3-Cobas-Roche diagnostics) with a lower sensitivity limit of 0.49 mg/dl.

Levels ≥0.5 mg/dl were considered abnormal.19

SECTION

Follow-up and outcomes

PARAGRAPH

After inclusion, patients were followed at least every six months in the clinic.

Each visit included physical examination, blood tests and abdominal ultrasound.

Follow-up data were gathered up to 36 months from baseline, or until OLT or death.

Development of ascites was the main outcome in patients with compensated cirrhosis (PS1, PS2 and PS3), while all-cause mortality/OLT was the main outcome for patients with decompensated cirrhosis (PS4 and PS5).

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard error, while categorical variables as absolute and percentage frequencies.

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to compare continuous variables among prognostic stages.

The Tukey test was used to perform multiple comparisons.

Two-way ANOVA was used to study the interaction of prognostic stages and cardiodynamic states on main clinical and hemodynamic continuous variables.

Chi-square test was applied to compare proportions.

PARAGRAPH

Analysis was performed separately for the compensated and decompensated stages.

PARAGRAPH

For the compensated stages (PS1, 2 and 3), the relevant outcome was development of ascites evident on physical examination and confirmed by ultrasound.

Direct-acting antivirals (DAA) treatment of hepatitis C virus, TIPS, OLT, and death during follow-up were treated as competing events, while patients who were event-free at the day of the last visit were censored.

PARAGRAPH

Comparison of cumulative incidence curves for the probability of developing overt ascites was performed by Gray’s test.

Multivariable analysis was performed using a backward stepwise Fine & Gray proportional hazards regression model for competing risks analysis, which incorporated age, MELD, albumin, CRP, HVPG, MAP, CI state, pcPH and treatment with non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB).

Use of NSBB was defined as a time-varying covariate, which started its effect the day when the maximal tolerated dose was reached.

PARAGRAPH

For the decompensated stages (PS4 and 5), the relevant outcomes were death or OLT.

TIPS placement or DAA treatment during follow-up were considered competing events.

Comparison of cumulative incidence curves for the probability of death/OLT was performed by Gray’s test.

Multivariable analysis was performed using a backward stepwise Fine & Gray proportional hazards regression model for competing risks analysis, which incorporated age, refractory ascites (PS5), MELD, CRP, HVPG, MAP, CI state, pcPH and NSBB.

Use of NSBB was considered a time-varying covariate as already stated.

Covariates of multivariable models were selected on the basis of both their clinical relevance and adherence to the aim of the study.

Backward stepwise selection of covariates was based on their p value at each iteration (variables with a significance >0.05 were removed).

Proportional hazards assumption of the Fine & Gray models was checked by means of graphical assessment of their weighted Schoenfeld-type residuals.

Moreover, we calculated estimates of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for the null model (i.e., without covariates), for all univariable models containing independent variables used in the final multivariable models, and for the final multivariable models themselves.

Finally, calibration plots by deciles20 for final competing risks multivariable models (at three years and at one year from baseline for compensated and decompensated patients, respectively) were implemented by the R package “pec”21 using 100 bootstrap replications.

PARAGRAPH

All statistical analyses were performed at 95% confidence intervals (p value <0.05), using R 3.3.2 and SAS Enterprise Guide 6.1.

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

As shown, 798 patients were initially evaluated, 320 were considered eligible and were referred for hepatic and cardiopulmonary hemodynamic assessment (Fig. S1).

Of these, 238 met inclusion criteria and form the basis of this study.

Notably, all patients in PS1 had a liver biopsy showing cirrhosis.

SECTION

Patient characteristics

PARAGRAPH

The mean age of the whole cohort was 58.4 ± 11.8 years, 66% were male.

The main etiologies of cirrhosis were viral hepatitis (50%), alcohol (17%) or both (11%).

PARAGRAPH

At the time of enrollment, 151 (63.4%) patients were compensated (no overt ascites, VH or encephalopathy) and 87 (36.6%) were decompensated (ascites in all, remote history of VH in 6, history or presence of encephalopathy in 13).

Among patients with compensated cirrhosis, 25 (16%) patients had mild portal hypertension (PS1), 36 (24%) CSPH but no GEV (PS2) and 90 (60%) had GEV (PS3) either present at endoscopy or obliterated via ligation (n = 9).

Among patients with decompensated cirrhosis, 48 (55%) had diuretic-responsive ascites (PS4) and 39 (45%) had refractory ascites (PS5).

Clinical characteristics by prognostic stage are shown (Table 1) and demonstrate a progressive worsening of liver function (albumin, bilirubin, and INR) and kidney function (creatinine) with each stage.

Consequently, MELD and CTP scores increase progressively with each stage.

SECTION

Hemodynamic changes in the different prognostic stages

PARAGRAPH

As shown (Table 1), portal pressure (HVPG) progressively increased from PS1 to PS5.

However, the largest difference in HVPG occurred between patients in PS1 and those in PS2 (mean HVPG 6.4 mmHg to 14.2 mmHg).

MAP was progressively lower from PS1 to PS5, while CI was progressively higher from PS1 to PS4 but relatively lower in PS5 (Table 1, Fig. 1).

PARAGRAPH

To add granularity to cardiac hemodynamics, data were analyzed using different “cardiodynamic “states”: a) hyperdynamic, defined as a CI above the upper limit of normal (>4.2 L/min/m2); b) normodynamic, defined as a CI between 3.2 (the average in the general population and in our PS1 group) and 4.2 L/min/m2; and c) relatively hypodynamic, defined as a CI <3.2 L/min/m2.

Using this categorization, the hyperdynamic state appeared as early as stage PS2 (Fig. 2).

However, at this stage and in all subsequent stages, up to one-third of the patients were relatively hypodynamic (Fig. 2).

Specific clinical and hemodynamic features in these subcategories are reported (Table 2).

Importantly, SVI decreased progressively with each prognostic stage in the hypodynamic state.

However, when left ventricle performance was expressed as LVSWI (that is in relationship to the pressure of work), its progressive impairment was observed both in the hypodynamic and hyperdynamic states, while this did not occur in the normodynamic group (Table 2, Fig. S2).

PARAGRAPH

Post-capillary pulmonary hypertension (pcPH), as an indicator of diastolic left ventricular dysfunction, was observed in patients with CSPH (that is from PS2 to PS5) at every cardiodynamic state (Fig. 2).

As expected, HVPG was significantly lower in the hypodynamic state at each prognostic stage (Table 2).

No minor/major complications related to both hepatic and cardiac hemodynamic procedures were observed.

SECTION

Systemic inflammation in the different prognostic stages

PARAGRAPH

C-reactive protein increased progressively from PS1 to PS5 with the highest levels observed in PS4 and PS5 (Table 1).

Notably, while an abnormal CRP (≥0.5 mg/dl) was observed only in 15% of the patients at the earliest stage (PS1), the proportion of patients with abnormal CRP increased progressively with more advanced stages, with 85% of patients at PS5 having a CRP ≥0.5 mg/dl (Fig. 3) (p <0.0001).

CRP levels were not significantly different among the different cardiodynamic states at each prognostic stage (Table 2).

SECTION

Follow-up and outcomes

PARAGRAPH

The number of outcomes per prognostic stage, ignoring the occurrence of competing events, is shown (Table S1).

PARAGRAPH

In the competing risks analysis, in the sample of 151 compensated patients the first event was ascites for 21 (13.9%), DAA for 27 (17.9%), TIPS for 1 (0.7%) and death or OLT for 6 (4.0%).

In the sample of 87 decompensated patients, the first event was death or OLT for 31 (35.6%), DAA treatment for 3 (3.4%), and TIPS placement (all for ascites) for 32 (36.8%).

SECTION

Development of ascites in compensated patients

PARAGRAPH

As shown, the three compensated sub-stages had significantly different cumulative probabilities of developing ascites, with a 36-month probability of 0%, 13.9% ± 1.1%, and 27.8% ± 0.6% for PS1, PS2, and PS3, respectively (p = 0.031 by Gray test) (Fig. S3A).

PARAGRAPH

Fine & Gray regression analysis revealed that age, HVPG, cardiodynamic state (hyper/relatively hypodynamic), and CRP were independent predictors of decompensation (Table 3), with a mean and median follow-up time of 568 days and 560 days.

No evidence of lack of proportional hazards was found (data not shown).

Pairwise interactions were tested in the final multivariable model, but none of them was statistically significant.

AIC was equal to 190.4 for the null model, to 187.9, 178.2, 186.5 and 187.6 for the univariable models containing age, HVPG, cardiodynamic state, and CRP, respectively, and was equal to 166.5 for the final multivariable model.

The latter had a satisfactory fit according to the calibration plots (Fig. S4A and S4C).

Predictors of ascites development did not change when only compensated patients with CSPH (PS2 and PS3) were analyzed, which adds robustness to our results (Table 3).

The cumulative risk of decompensation in each cardiodynamic state of patients with CSPH is shown (Fig. 4A).

ROC analysis in these patients (data not shown) identified 16 mmHg and 1.0 mg/dl as the best discriminating cut-offs for HVPG and CRP, respectively.

SECTION

Mortality in decompensated patients

PARAGRAPH

The 12-month probability of death/OLT was 27.7 ± 0.7% and 41.0 ± 0.9% in PS4 and PS5, respectively (p = 0.223 by Gray test) (Fig. S3B).

PARAGRAPH

Fine & Gray regression analysis in patients with decompensated cirrhosis revealed that MELD, CRP, cardiodynamic state (hyper/relatively hypodynamic), and pcPH were independent predictors for the risk of death/OLT (Table 3) in a mean and median follow-up time of 307 days and 192 days.

No evidence of lack of proportional hazards was found (data not shown).

Pairwise interactions were tested in the final multivariable model, but none of them was statistically significant.

AIC was equal to 262.8 for the null model, to 252.0, 261.4, 259.4 and 259.5 for the univariable models containing MELD, pcPH, cardiodynamic state, and CRP, respectively, and was equal to 242.4 for the final multivariable model.

The latter had a satisfactory fit according to the calibration plots (Fig. S4B, D).

The 36-month cumulative risk of death/OLT in each cardiodynamic state and in patients with pcPH, respectively, are shown (Fig. 4B,C).

ROC analysis (data not shown) identified 15 and 1.0 mg/dl as the best discriminating cut-offs for MELD and CRP, respectively.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

This is the first study that characterizes clinical, portal and cardio-systemic hemodynamic states (obtained directly by cardiac and hepatic vein catheterization) and systemic inflammation in different prognostic sub-stages of compensated and decompensated cirrhosis.

Importantly, it determines the interrelationship among these parameters and relevant outcomes for the two main stages of cirrhosis, compensated or decompensated.

SECTION

Compensated cirrhosis

PARAGRAPH

In patients with compensated cirrhosis, those with mild PH (PS1) have normal mean CI and MAP, which become abnormal as early as the CSPH without GEV stage (PS2).

In fact, the marked differences in hemodynamic indices between these stages (PS1 and PS2) suggest that there may be intermediate hemodynamically-defined events.

As expected, the lowest MAP and highest mean CI occurred in patients with GEV (Table 1 and Fig. 1).

However, description of mean values of CI among the prognostic stages does not quite depict the hemodynamic variability already present in compensated patients.

Indeed, while patients with a hyperdynamic state (CI >4.2 L/min/m2) appear as early as stage PS2, as recently described,22 there is a subgroup of patients with CSPH (with or without GEV) that have a relatively hypodynamic state (CI <3.2 L/min/m2) in the supine position.

Patients in this state show significant loss of inotropic performance of the left ventricle from PS1 to PS3.

It is conceivable that, when they assume the upright posture, ventricular performance will further deteriorate because of a relative increase in peripheral vascular resistance, leading to sodium and water retention.

This detrimental effect of postural change can also affect patients with CI at the highest levels.23

Because non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB) mainly act via amelioration of the hyperdynamic state and this is absent in patients at PS1, it explains the recent finding that propranolol is less effective in reducing portal pressure in these patients.22

However, the clinical impact of NSBB in patients with CSPH and hypodynamic features remains to be determined.

PARAGRAPH

Together with a progressively greater cardiocirculatory derangement, we observed a progressively higher proportion of patients with inflammation, indicated by progressively higher levels of CRP, with the largest increase in PS3.

Although a CRP level above 0.5 mg/dl has already been shown to discriminate between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients,24,25 these findings are rather unexpected as it has been assumed that inflammation occurs in the decompensated stage and contributes to further worsening of an already altered hemodynamic state.

In fact, in experimental cirrhosis, only rats with ascites experience bacterial translocation and this phenomenon has been associated with an increase in cytokines and worsening of splanchnic vasodilation.9

Our study suggests that these mechanisms may be in place even at a compensated stage, but this requires further confirmation.

It may be that at earlier stages, bacterial products rather than bacteria translocate.12

These bacterial products and the secondary systemic inflammation may further affect cardiac function, particularly in patients with hyper- and relatively hypodynamic circulatory states.

PARAGRAPH

Portal pressure (as determined by the HVPG), cardiodynamic state (relatively hypo- or hyperdynamic), and CRP were predictors of ascites development.

While the finding of portal pressure as a main predictor of decompensation in patients with compensated cirrhosis had already been demonstrated in patients without GEV,26 we prospectively confirmed that HVPG at a cut-off of 16 mmHg predicts decompensation in patients with CSPH.27

PARAGRAPH

Portal hypertension driven inflammation, systemic hemodynamic derangement and cardiac dysfunction may be the pleiotropic target of statins, which have recently been shown to reduce the risk of decompensation and death in patients with cirrhosis.28,29

SECTION

Decompensated cirrhosis

PARAGRAPH

In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, those with ascites still responsive to diuretics (PS4) had the highest mean CI of all stages/sub-stages of cirrhosis, while MAP was the lowest in PS5.

In the latter prognostic stage there was an expansion of the group with a relatively hypodynamic circulatory state (Fig. 2).

It is conceivable that the increased proportion of hypodynamic patients we observed in PS5 is a consequence of a functional shift from the hyperdynamic and normodynamic states due to a primary deterioration of cardiac inotropic activity30 and/or to paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction.14

Nevertheless, the latter risk is highly decreased by the infusion of albumin.14

Moreover, LVP should have minimized the risk of overestimating the proportion of patients with a relatively hypodynamic circulation and/or pcPH due to the abdomino-thoracic pressure transmission.

Meanwhile, albumin infusion, by increasing heart preload, should have reduced the risk of underestimating the proportion of patients with underlying preserved systolic function and/or hyperdynamic features.

PARAGRAPH

As shown in compensated cirrhosis, the progression of hemodynamic abnormalities in decompensated cirrhosis was accompanied by an increase in systemic inflammation as determined by CRP levels, with the highest levels (considering all stages of cirrhosis) in patients with refractory ascites.

This result supports the hypothesis that inflammation is one of the main drivers of hemodynamic derangement in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.12,31

Interestingly, even though HVPG was the highest in decompensated cirrhosis, platelet count was higher in these patients than in compensated PS2 and PS3 patients.

Because systemic inflammation is accompanied by increased number (and activation) of circulating platelets,32 we consider that this otherwise inexplicable phenomenon can be explained by greater inflammation in decompensated cirrhosis.

PARAGRAPH

Regarding mortality, MELD, cardiodynamic state (relatively hypo- or hyperdynamic), pcPH, and CRP resulted independent predictors.

MELD is a known strong predictor of death in patients with decompensated cirrhosis2 and the cut-off of 15 has been associated with post-OLT outcomes.33

Decompensated cirrhotics in the hypo or hyperdynamic states have further impairment of heart inotropic functional reserve that explains their higher risk of death (Fig. 4B and Fig. S2).30,34,35

The fact that, in decompensated patients, pcPH is an independent predictor of outcome raises the possibility of severe diastolic dysfunction as a further mechanism of left ventricular impairment in the most advanced stages of cirrhosis.36

In ascitic patients with hypo/hyperdynamic states and/or pcPH, the potential detrimental impact of volume/pressure overload of the heart after TIPS and/or OLT should be defined.

PARAGRAPH

Although CRP has been shown to be an independent predictor of death in non-stratified patients (compensated vs. decompensated) with alcoholic cirrhosis,37 this study confirms that CRP predicts death in the short-term in non-septic31,35,38 decompensated patients with different etiologies.

PARAGRAPH

Our finding of CRP as an independent predictor of relevant outcomes in patients with both compensated and decompensated cirrhosis is an indication that inflammation plays a major role in the pathogenesis of cirrhosis progression, as proposed by Bernardi et al.12 This evidence supports the use of drugs targeting systemic inflammation both in compensated28,29,39 and decompensated patients.35

However, mechanisms that lead to inflammation may be different at the different stages and this requires further examination.

As this was an exploratory study, other markers of inflammation or indirect indicators of bacterial translocation were not assessed.

For the same reason we did not measure natriuretic peptides and the activity of endogenous vasoactive systems, such as plasma renin activity or plasma concentration of aldosterone and norepinephrine that would be correlated with hemodynamic/inflammatory abnormalities.

PARAGRAPH

In summary, our study demonstrates that portal pressure (HVPG), systemic hemodynamics (CI, MAP), liver function (MELD) and systemic inflammation (CRP) worsen from PS1 to PS5.

Although one may argue that some of these findings had been previously shown, we describe them in the context of a concurrent prospective cohort of patients with cirrhosis sub-classified into important prognostic stages and define cut-offs of prognostic indicators.

However, the most novel aspect of this study is the description of three cardiodynamic states based on cardiac index.

Even though, CI increases progressively from PS1 (normal CI) through PS4 and then decreases at PS5 and this was in general described as the hyperdynamic circulatory state of cirrhosis, we find that a significant percentage of patients even in the compensated stages have a CI that is below the average for normal patients (and for those at PS1 stage).

This cardiodynamic classification is relevant because both patients that are “relatively” hypodynamic (CI <3.2 L/min/m2) and those that are clearly hyperdynamic (CI >4.2 L/min/m2) have a progressively more altered left ventricular function from PS1 to PS5 (Table 2 and Fig. S2), deterioration that is not observed in the normodynamic group.

This has important prognostic implications as both the hyper and hypodynamic states are independent predictors of relevant outcomes (ascites in compensated patients, death in decompensated patients).

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, we suggest that the interplay between cardiocirculatory factors and inflammation has an important role in the prognosis of both compensated and decompensated patients with cirrhosis.

Given that we had a moderately low events/variables ratio, particularly in compensated patients, our results may be affected by data over-fitting with biased estimates of hazard ratios.

Adequately sized external datasets are therefore needed to validate our prognostic models.

Moreover, the sequential interaction among bacterial translocation, inflammation, and hemodynamic alterations at different stages of cirrhosis and in different cardiodynamic groups should be dynamically explored.

If our results are confirmed, definition of the cardiodynamic state and presence of elevated CRP may help to identify cirrhotic patients at higher risk of ascites development and death.
