TITLE

Cardiopulmonary hemodynamics and C-reactive protein as prognostic indicators in compensated and decompensated cirrhosis

PARAGRAPH

There are two main stages in cirrhosis, compensated and decompensated, each with a main relevant outcome.

In compensated cirrhosis the main relevant outcome is the development of ascites, while in decompensated cirrhosis it is death.

Major roles of cardiac dysfunction and systemic inflammation have been hypothesized in the evolution of the disease in decompensated patients.

In this study, we have shown that these factors were also involved in the progression from compensated to decompensated stage.
