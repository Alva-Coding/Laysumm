ABSTRACT

TITLE

A schistosome miRNA promotes host hepatic fibrosis by targeting transforming growth factor beta receptor III

PARAGRAPH

MicroRNAs (MiRNAs) derived from parasites, and even from plants, have been detected in body fluids and are known to modulate host genes.

In this study, we aimed to investigate if the schistosome miRNAs are involved in the occurrence and progression of hepatic fibrosis during Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) infection.

PARAGRAPH

The presence of miRNAs from S. japonicum (sja-miRNAs) in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) was detected by RNA sequencing.

sja-miRNAs were screened by transfecting HSCs with sja-miRNA mimics.

The role of sja-miR-2162 in hepatic fibrosis was evaluated by either elevating its expression in naïve mice or by inhibiting its activity in infected mice, through administration of recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 8 vectors expressing sja-miR-2162 or miRNA sponges, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

We identified a miRNA of S. japonicum, sja-miR-2162, that was consistently present in the HSCs of infected mice.

Transfection of sja-miR-2162 mimics led to activation of HSC cells in vitro, characterized by elevation of collagens and α-SMA.

The rAAV8-mediated delivery of sja-miR-2162 to naïve mice induced hepatic fibrosis, while sustained inhibition of sja-miR-2162 in infected mice attenuated hepatic fibrosis.

The transforming growth factor beta receptor III (TGFBR3), a negative regulator of TGF-β signaling, was a direct target of sja-miR-2162 in HSCs.

PARAGRAPH

This study demonstrated that pathogen-derived miRNAs directly promote hepatic fibrogenesis in a cross-species manner, and their efficient and sustained inhibition might present a promising therapeutic intervention for infectious diseases.
