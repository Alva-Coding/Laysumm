TITLE

Deriving the optimal limit of detection for an HCV point-of-care test for viraemic infection: Analysis of a global dataset

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Globally, viral hepatitis is responsible for 1.34 million deaths1,2 and more than 50 million of the estimated 70 million cases of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) occur in low and middle-income countries (LMICs).3

The World Health Organization (WHO) defined goals towards the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat, with a 90% reduction in new infections, and a 65% reduction in mortality by 2030.1,4

Achievement of these targets requires scale-up of access to affordable testing and treatment alongside interventions for HCV prevention (harm reduction and safe blood donation and injections).5

Progress in treatment scale-up is encouraging with more than 3 million treated with direct-acting antivirals since 2015, however, testing coverage and diagnosis rates are still less than 10% in LMICs.6

PARAGRAPH

Approximately 15–45% of people infected with HCV will spontaneously clear the virus7,8 and therefore confirmation of HCV viraemia is necessary to identify those needing treatment.

The standard diagnostic algorithm recommended by the WHO includes an initial HCV antibody test followed by confirmatory testing for viraemia with either a nucleic acid test (NAT) for HCV RNA or core antigen (HCVcAg) where RNA tests are not available.9–11

High proportions of those with positive antibody fail to have confirmatory testing and are never linked to treatment.12,13

Further, available tests for viraemia are expensive, and require advanced laboratory facilities, electricity, water, and refrigerated reagents.

Few LMICs have testing policies or the requisite laboratory infrastructure in place13–15

PARAGRAPH

Innovations in testing technology, and research to inform optimal implementation strategies for HCV in LMICs are needed.9,16,15

A rapid, affordable, easy-to-use test for confirmation of HCV viraemia at the point-of-care (POC) that can be deployed on a large scale has the potential to improve outcomes across the diagnosis and care continuum, particularly in high HCV prevalence settings.16–18

PARAGRAPH

Presently, there are no data to determine a limit of detection (LOD) for WHO prequalification criteria for a POC HCV viraemia test.

Thus, POC tests are held to the same standards as laboratory-based NATs.

The laboratory-based Abbott RealTime HCV viral load test, for example, is able to detect and measure HCV RNA down to 12 international units per milliliter (IU/ml) with >99% sensitivity; similarly, the Roche COBAS®TaqMan® HCV Test reports an LOD of 15 IU/ml.19

The laboratory-based Abbott ARCHITECT HCVcAg test has an LOD corresponding to 3,000 IU/ml with 93.4% sensitivity.20

Requiring POC assays to achieve the same prequalification criteria as laboratory assays may limit the ability to expand HCV testing and treatment in LMICs.

The POC Genedrive® HCV assay, however, acquired European in vitro diagnostics approval this year with an LOD of 2,362 IU/ml,21 but is not yet WHO prequalified.

Additionally, Cepheid Xpert® HCV Viral Load finger-stick assay detects as little as 40 IU/ml and can utilise consolidated near-patient Xpert platforms or the POC Omni version.22

PARAGRAPH

A consensus target product profile in 2017 outlined price targets and operational characteristics for a near-patient HCV viraemia test18 including but not limited to: a minimal LOD of 1,000–3,000 IU/ml, minimal test sensitivity of 95%, test cost <$15 though ideally <$5, and instrument cost <$20,000 but ideally <$2,000.

Currently, available platforms struggle to meet these price targets.

Data are needed to estimate the clinical sensitivity of the potential minimum LOD recommendations.

Integrating NAT data outlined above with the goals from the target product profile, we hypothesise that a POC assay with an LOD of 1,000 IU/ml (3 log IU/ml) would have >97% clinical sensitivity for confirming HCV viraemia.

A single-step POC test would allow for accessible, low-cost testing of viraemia without loss to follow-up in LMICs, despite having a lower analytical sensitivity.18,23,24

Our objective is to determine the requisite LOD for an affordable POC assay to diagnose the majority of people with chronic HCV, and to identify characteristics of those with low-level viraemia (LLV) who might be missed by a less sensitive test.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Study design

PARAGRAPH

We assembled a cross-sectional dataset of the first available HCV RNA measurement for HCV antibody positive persons with viraemia from high, moderate, and low HCV prevalence settings in 12 countries (Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Egypt, Georgia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mozambique, Pakistan, Thailand, and Vietnam) with representation of the 6 major HCV genotypes, a broad range of liver fibrosis stages, and varying prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection.

To test our hypothesis, we analyzed the distribution of HCV RNA at the time of diagnosis, and performed bivariate and multivariable analyses to identify demographic and clinical characteristics associated with LLV, defined as those in the lowest 3% of the distribution of HCV viral load (i.e., those missed by a test with 97% clinical sensitivity).

PARAGRAPH

We performed a cross-sectional analysis of initial HCV viral load data and linked demographic (age, sex, country of testing) and clinical (HIV and HBV co-infection, HCV genotype, fibrosis stage) data collected between January 1, 2007 and June 1, 2017.

We included males and females of all ages with detectable quantitative HCV RNA.

We excluded participants with missing age or sex demographics and those on HCV treatment.

We grouped countries by WHO regions: African, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, European, South East Asia, and Western Pacific.

SECTION

Data sources

PARAGRAPH

We identified potential patient cohorts for inclusion from 2 main sources: the WHO global hepatitis programme contacts database that includes implementing partners and international HCV researchers, and a PubMed literature search using the search terms “HCV RNA quantification” and “cohort study” to identify additional cohorts of people with HCV infection.

Criteria for potential inclusion in this analysis were available HCV RNA quantification linked to comprehensive demographic and clinical data among populations outside of the United States.

We contacted study authors and established a working group with all respondents who agreed to share data.

Fig. S1 shows a flow-chart of contributing sites and countries, and Table 1 summarises characteristics of the source data, including: HCV epidemiology of the country or region of origin (prevalence, population affected, World Bank country classification), patient inclusion and exclusion criteria if from a research cohort, and reason for HCV testing.

PARAGRAPH

We determined the main source of patient samples and basis for HCV testing from study protocols or direct communication with collaborators.

Reasons for testing were categorised as: i) targeted among specific high-risk populations (people who inject drugs, birth cohorts, healthcare workers), or ii) clinically indicated (i.e. testing of those with clinical signs or symptoms or laboratory features suggestive of hepatitis), or iii) routine as part of large-scale screening programmes (i.e. antenatal clinics, blood donors, seroprevalence surveys).

We included data from 1 large reference laboratory in a high-income setting (Canada) as a comparison to LMICs.

SECTION

Data concatenation

PARAGRAPH

We predefined a protocol for data concatenation.

We outlined categories and associated dummy variables for all categorical variables (age, sex, country, WHO region, HCV genotype, fibrosis stage).

HCV viral load measurements at each site were reported in IU/ml.

Sample specifics (serum or plasma) and platform used for quantification were collected where available.

We determined fibrosis stage either from transient elastography (Fibroscan®) results reported in Metavir stage, or calculated from Fibrosis-4 score25,26 as these scores correlate well with Fibroscan.27–29

For those with a Fibrosis-4 score <1.45, we assigned Metavir stage F0-F1.

For scores between 1.45 and 3.25, we assigned stage F2-F3, and scores above 3.25 we assigned to stage F4.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

We employed descriptive statistics to derive the HCV viral load distribution in log10 IU/ml for initial HCV RNA among all patients in the combined dataset.

From this distribution, we identified the LOD levels of HCV RNA in IU/ml corresponding to the 95th, 97th, and 99th percentiles, i.e. the level of HCV RNA below which the infection would be missed.

To estimate the 95% CI for each LOD, we performed bootstrap and Markov chain Monte Carlo method30 to randomly simulate a population of 10,000 patients from the total dataset.

We then calculated the LOD at the 95th, 97th, and 99th percentiles from this sample population, and repeated the procedure 10,000 times to obtain an LOD range for each percentile.

We then calculated the 95% CIs from these sample distributions.

PARAGRAPH

We defined LLV as HCV RNA in the lowest 3% of the distribution, below the LOD corresponding to the 97th percentile determined above.

We then calculated summary statistics for covariates of interest and tested associations between each covariate and the odds of having LLV.

We used a stepwise approach to construct a multivariable logistic regression model of the odds of LLV.

Covariates remained in the multiple logistic regression model when their p value was ≤0.05 and we found no substantial multicollinearity.

We tested for effect modification with predefined stratified analyses: i) HIV subset analysis, ii) HBV subset analysis, iii) fibrosis stage with transient elastography data only.

We also assessed the effect of varying the fibrosis classification thresholds of the Fibrosis-4 score.

First, we shifted the cut-offs toward F4: scores <1.20, we assigned stage F0-F1, 1.20 to 3.0 stage F2-F3, and scores >3.0 stage F4.

We then shifted the cut-offs away from F4: scores <1.60 stage F0-F1, 1.60 to 3.45 stage F2-F3, and scores >3.45 stage F4.

PARAGRAPH

Next, we performed data imputation for the missing exposures of interest (HIV co-infection, HBV co-infection, HCV genotype, fibrosis stage) to create a dataset for sensitivity analyses.

We employed parametric regression imputation with a prediction model to impute the missing values for fibrosis stage.31

We utilised prevalence data specific to each country for HCV genotype, HIV and HBV co-infection, and imputed missing data for these variables within each country cohort.

For example, we used the genotype distributions described in each country as the probabilities of having each genotype, we then employed Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to stochastically assign a genotype to each individual.

We used the same method adapting country and sex specific HIV and HBV prevalence data.

PARAGRAPH

We then used the imputed dataset to test associations between each covariate and the odds of having LLV with bivariate and multivariable logistic regression, and compared the results with the non-imputed total population dataset.

Finally, we quantitatively compared the performance of the LOD from the total population dataset among the covariates with significant associations with LLV in the imputed dataset by deriving the relative percentiles from HCV RNA distributions for subsets from each significant covariate.

We used R version 1.0.136 to perform all statistical analyses.

Dataset characteristics

PARAGRAPH

The dataset included 66,640 individuals with HCV viraemia from Cambodia (2.6%), Canada (40.9%), Cameroon (0.4%), Egypt (1.6%), Georgia (44.4%), India (8.1%), Indonesia (0.2%), Malaysia (0.05%), Mozambique (0.02%), Pakistan (1.3%), Thailand (0.2%), and Vietnam (0.1%) (Fig. S1).

Table 1 contains data source characteristics and summarises country-level HCV prevalence data and genotype distribution.

PARAGRAPH

Characteristics for the total population cohort (TPC) are presented in Table 2.

Females comprised 24.4% (16,320) of participants with a median age of 48 years.

Among those also tested for HIV (54.3%) and HBV (50.7%), 10.9% (3,945) were HIV co-infected, and 21.4% (7,221) were HBV co-infected.

We identified the HCV genotype distribution as follows: 40.9% (27,245) genotype 1, 13.9% (9,287) genotype 2, 22.7% (15,157) genotype 3, 3.0% (2,030) genotype 4, <1% (13) genotype 5, 1.3% (889) genotype 6, <1% (170) with mixed genotype, and 17.8% (11,849) with missing genotype data.

We categorised 12,880 (38.1%) individuals as Metavir fibrosis stage F0-F1, 12,242 (36.3%) as F2-F3, and 8,644 (25.6%) as F4 among the 33,766 individuals with available fibrosis staging data (Fibroscan or Fibrosis-4 score).

HCV viral load distribution & limit of detection analyses

PARAGRAPH

The HCV RNA (log10 IU/ml) frequency distribution is depicted in Fig. 1.

We derived the LOD for the 95th, 97th and 99th percentiles as: 3,311 IU/ml (95% CI 3,256.3–3,368.0), 1,318 IU/ml (95% CI 1,298.4–1,322.3), and 214 IU/ml (95% CI 207.1–218.6) respectively.

We further visualised the HCV RNA distribution to compare the mean HCV RNA for each covariate with violin plots (Fig. 2).

Violin plots depict a box plot where a circle denotes the median and the interquartile range is shown by a box in solid black.

Overlaid on this box plot is a kernel density plot indicating more data where the plot is thicker and less where it narrows.

We then derived violin plots for each country to illustrate the viral load distribution by site as a surrogate approach to control for variation in quantification platforms and sampling techniques (Fig. S2).

The mean RNA lies between 5 and 6 log IU/ml in all cohorts.

SECTION

Identification of subgroups with low-level viraemia

PARAGRAPH

We derived the odds of association with LLV for each covariate with the following groups selected as a reference because each contained the largest volume from the reference laboratory dataset in Canada: 51–64 years of age, male sex, Canada, Americas, genotype 1.

Bivariate analyses indicated increased odds of LLV <1,318 IU/ml for those aged 18–30 and 31–50 years, participants from India, the South East Asian region, and those with HIV co-infection or genotype 2 and 3 infection (Table 2).

The OR was highest between those aged 18–30 years and the reference group aged 51–64 years, at 3.06 (95% CI 2.68–3.49).

India had an OR of 2.33 (95% CI 2.05–2.65) compared to Canada.

South East Asia had an OR of 2.19 (95% CI 1.92–2.48) compared to the Americas.

HIV co-infected persons had an OR for LLV of 1.57 (95% CI 1.34–1.84) compared to those without HIV.

Lastly, genotype 2 had an OR of 1.24 (95% CI 1.07–1.43) and genotype 3 OR 1.17 (95% CI 1.03–1.33) compared to genotype 1.

PARAGRAPH

In a multivariable model controlling for age, sex, WHO Region, HIV and HBV co-infections, genotype, and fibrosis stage, the 18–30-year age group, female sex, genotypes 2 and 3, and fibrosis stage F4 remained associated with increased odds for LLV (Table 2).

Persons 18–30 years of age had an adjusted OR (aOR) of 2.56 (95% 2.19–2.99) compared to the 51–64-year-old age group.

For female sex, the aOR was 1.32 (95% CI 1.18–1.49) compared to males.

The aORs for genotype 2 and 3 compared to genotype 1 were 1.24 and 1.17, respectively.

Lastly, for advanced fibrosis stage F4, the aOR increased to 1.44 (95% CI 1.21–1.69) compared to stage F0-1.

We did not detect significant interactions between: i) sex and fibrosis stage, ii) genotype and country, iii) genotype and sex, iv) genotype and age group.

SECTION

Stratified and sensitivity analyses

PARAGRAPH

Stratified analyses for HIV and HBV co-infection did not suggest an effect measure modification for either covariate (Tables S2 and S3).

A subset analysis of those with Fibroscan results did not differ from that of the total dataset population (Table S4).

Similarly, sensitivity analyses varying the cut-off thresholds for fibrosis stage classification by Fibrosis-4 scores did not impact the associations found for fibrosis stage and LLV (data not shown).

PARAGRAPH

Characteristics for the cohort after missing data imputation for HIV, HBV, genotype, and fibrosis stage are presented in Table S5.

Now 6.3% (4,169) are classified as HIV-coinfected (compared to 5.9% in the TPC and 10.9% among those tested, Table 2), and 12.2% (8,161) as HBV co-infected (10.8% in TPC, 21.4% among those tested).

The genotype distribution was similar to the TPC.

Fibrosis stage categories were also similar to those with data in the TPC.

In the imputation regression analyses, significant associations with LLV remained after multivariable adjustment for: groups aged 18–30 (aOR 2.44) and 31–50 (aOR 1.29) years, female sex (aOR 1.31), participants from South East Asia (aOR 1.59), and fibrosis stage F4 (aOR 1.14) (Table S5).

The increased odds among HIV co-infection, and HCV genotypes 2 and 3 in the TPC attenuated in the imputed dataset.

SECTION

Relative percentiles for significant covariates

PARAGRAPH

While an HCV RNA of 1,318 IU/ml correlated to the 97th percentile in the total population dataset, the relative percentiles corresponding to the 1,318 IU/ml LOD for significant covariates were: 93% for age group 18–30, 96.7% for females, 93.8% for participants from South East Asia, 95.3% for HIV co-infected, and 96.8% for fibrosis stage F4 (Fig. 3A).

Though genotypes 2 and 3 had increased odds for LLV, the relative percentiles remained >97%.

All percentiles were similar in the imputed dataset sensitivity analyses (Fig. 3B).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

This dataset of 66,640 individuals from 12 countries representative of 6 global regions represents the largest and most comprehensive dataset assembled to address the issue of clinical sensitivity of different LODs for detection of HCV viraemia.

Our data confirm that with an LOD of 1,318 IU/ml (3.12 log IU/ml), 97% of viraemic HCV infections would be identified.

These data further support the recent European Association for the Study of the Liver recommendation for an LOD of 1,000 IU/ml among diagnostic nucleic acid assays for use in LMICs.32

While several covariates were associated with increased odds for LLV below 1,318 IU/ml, we report a relative sensitivity below 95% only for the 18–30-year age group (93.6% sensitivity) and among participants in South East Asia (93.8% sensitivity); genotypes 2 and 3 were associated with LLV but the relative sensitivity remained >97%.

The prevalence of LLV among the 18–30-year age group in this study may reflect fluctuating viraemia that occurs with early HCV infection.33,34

Of note, many of the participants from sites in South East Asia were active injection drug users and may also have had early HCV infection.

We have insufficient data in the TPC to conduct a subset analysis of people who inject drugs.

PARAGRAPH

Our findings differ from previous studies that evaluated HCV viral load quantification as many were designed to evaluate predictors of high-level viraemia; however, the degree of LLV we describe is similar to an evaluation of 2,472 people with genotype 1 infection.35

Another study of 148 people with HCV infection found lower levels of circulating HCV RNA among those with decompensated cirrhosis.36

We captured a trend toward LLV, but this was not sufficient to alter the relative sensitivity of the LOD in this sub-population.

From the available data, we could not identify those who had decompensated cirrhosis within the F4 stage.

Therefore, the OR may be slightly diminished by the number of participants with compensated cirrhosis in this group who still have abundant healthy hepatocytes that allow for HCV replication.

Prior studies reported higher HCV RNA levels among those with HIV.37,38

In contrast, our data suggest increased odds for LLV among those with HIV co-infection and a decrease in the sensitivity of the LOD to 95.2%.

Data on use of antiretroviral therapy and level of viral load suppression were not available from all data sources, and therefore the level of HCV viral load among those with advanced stage HIV either not receiving or failing on therapy, could not be compared to those with well-controlled HIV infection on effective antiretroviral therapy.

Lastly, these studies were designed to investigate outcomes or treatment predictors and had much smaller sample sizes that limit their power to evaluate the LLV frequency.

PARAGRAPH

The main strengths of this study are the large sample size powered to investigate covariates of interest and the wide representation of different geographic regions and genotypes.

Regions with high HCV prevalence (Egypt, Georgia) were well represented as well as lower prevalence settings (Cameroon).

PARAGRAPH

There are several limitations to this study.

Identified and included patient cohorts were those with available HCV RNA linked with clinical and demographic data and therefore may not be generalisable.

We conducted a secondary analysis of data from populations that were tested for HCV for a range of reasons.

There were also different methods for data collection at each site.

While some data represent a broad sample of tests performed in the general population at a reference laboratory, other data were collected as part of research protocols with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria.

There were missing data for several covariates (HIV and HBV co-infection, HCV genotype, fibrosis stage) in 20–52% of the participants.

We performed sensitivity analyses including a comparative regression model using imputed data to better characterise bias introduced by missing data and found the introduced bias to be limited overall.

PARAGRAPH

This study investigated the viral load distribution among those with chronic HCV infection from 12 countries in different geographic regions to estimate the requisite clinical sensitivity of a POC test for HCV diagnosis and inform sub-populations that may be at risk of false negative testing.

Our findings suggest that a test with an LOD of 1,318 IU/ml, which is about 100 times higher (less sensitive) than the current gold-standard NATs, will likely detect 97% of viraemic HCV infections.

While an increase in LOD may not impact cost and development of near-patient molecular technologies, it sets an achievable LOD for immunoassays such as those that involve HCV core antigen detection.

Comparative and cost-effectiveness analyses will be needed to investigate settings that may benefit the most, and to quantify how a less sensitive test might impact the diagnosis, treatment and cure cascade in LMICs.

A product specification that allows for an LOD of 1,318 IU/ml could facilitate development of an affordable non-molecular POC test that could dramatically increase rates of HCV testing and treatment initiation in LMICs, thus substantially impacting health outcomes for chronic HCV infection on a population-level.
