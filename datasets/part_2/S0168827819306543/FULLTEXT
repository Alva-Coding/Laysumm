TITLE

PSMP/MSMP promotes hepatic fibrosis through CCR2 and represents a novel therapeutic target

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Liver fibrosis, a wound-healing response to chronic liver injury, is characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the liver and is triggered by a variety of causes, including hepatitis virus infection, alcohol abuse, cholestasis, autoimmune, drug/toxin and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which eventually lead to loss of liver function and disruption of the liver structure.1,2

The initiation of fibrosis crucially depends on an inflammatory phase in which liver resident macrophages, Kupffer cells, are activated and release transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), as well as other proinflammatory cytokines that activate hepatic stellate cells (HSCs).3–7

HSCs are responsible for producing most of the ECM and play a central role in liver fibrogenesis.8,9

HSCs are quiescent and located in the space between hepatocytes and sinusoidal endothelium (space of Disse) as retinoid storage cells.10

Upon liver injury, HSCs, the major collagen-synthesizing cells in the liver, are activated and transdifferentiate into myofibroblast-like cells, which show enhanced proliferation, chemotaxis, survival and collagen production.8,9,11,12

HSC activation is driven by multiple mediators, such as chemokines, reactive oxygen species, growth factors, matrix stiffness, matricellular proteins and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).5,8,13

Currently, there are no approved drugs that can effectively reverse liver fibrosis, further highlighting the urgent clinical need for novel antifibrotic therapies.14

PARAGRAPH

Extensive in vitro and in vivo investigations have elucidated the pivotal role played by the chemokine-chemokine receptor system in the pathogenesis of liver diseases.15,16

Among these mediators, the C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)/C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) axis was shown to have a predominant role in liver inflammation and fibrosis.17–26

Disruption of CCR2 signaling impedes liver fibrosis, as shown by the altered chemotaxis and transdifferentiation of HSCs.17–21

In human liver diseases, increased CCL2 is associated with macrophage recruitment and liver fibrosis progression.22

In addition, CCL2 inhibition attenuated CCl4-induced liver injury and fibrosis by inhibiting macrophage recruitment.23–26

Cenicriviroc (CVC) is a novel oral dual CCR2/CCR5 antagonist with nanomolar potency against both receptors.27

Both preclinical and clinical data have indicated that CVC is a safe and potent antifibrotic agent for the treatment of alcohol-induced steatohepatitis and NASH with fibrosis, and this drug is currently being tested in a phase III trial.27–29

PARAGRAPH

PSMP, namely, PC3-secreted microprotein, or microseminoprotein (MSMP), was initially found in PC3 cells, benign and malignant prostate tissues.30

Our previous study using omics strategies revealed that PSMP is a novel chemotactic cytokine acting as a CCR2 ligand to recruit peripheral blood monocytes and lymphocytes that may influence inflammation and cancer development.31

The affinity between PSMP and CCR2 was found to be comparable to that between CCL2 and CCR2.31

PSMP was expressed in human colitis tissues and significantly upregulated in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse colitis.32

PSMP plays a vital role in promoting DSS-induced colitis by chemoattraction of Ly6Chi monocytes in a CCR2-dependent manner.32

Another study found that PSMP expression is induced with prolonged anti-VEGF therapy, specifically under hypoxia, and has an important proangiogenic role in treatment-resistant ovarian tumors.33

PARAGRAPH

In this study, we first discovered that PSMP expression was significantly upregulated in patients with fibrosis/cirrhosis compared to that of normal human liver tissues by screening PSMP expression in the tissues of patients with liver disease.

However, the physiological and pathological functions of PSMP in the liver have not yet been reported.

Our study showed that knocking out Psmp or neutralizing PSMP activity attenuated liver injury and fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), bile-duct ligation (BDL), and 5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet34 in mice.

We addressed the profibrotic roles of PSMP by combining Psmp knockout mice and adeno-associated virus (AAV)-8 vectors expressing the human PSMP (hPSMP).

We also demonstrated that PSMP promoted M1 macrophage polarization and HSC activation in vitro.

Together, these results are the first to show that PSMP is a potential therapeutic target for liver fibrosis.

Results

SECTION

PSMP expression is upregulated in human and murine liver fibrosis

PARAGRAPH

We used a variety of cancer and paracancerous tissue arrays and found that PSMP showed significantly higher expression in the liver cancer-adjacent tissues.

To determine whether PSMP expression is associated with liver disease, we initially examined PSMP levels in tissue arrays of different liver diseases by immunohistochemistry.

PSMP was significantly upregulated in cirrhotic and HCC-adjacent liver tissues, which showed diffuse cytoplasmic staining in hepatocytes (Fig. 1A).

Then, we confirmed this finding in human fibrotic/cirrhotic liver tissues from cases with different etiologies of liver disease, including chronic hepatitis B (n = 20), chronic hepatitis C (n = 8), primary biliary cholangitis (n = 13), autoimmune hepatitis (n = 5), drug-induced liver disease (n = 7), alcohol-related liver disease (n = 6) and Buddi-Chiari syndrome (n = 3).

Normal control samples were obtained from 7 liver donors to transplantation with normal liver function and no appearance of hepatic steatosis, inflammation or fibrosis in histology.

Demographics and clinical characteristics of human samples were presented in Table S1.

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that hepatic PSMP expression was significantly increased in fibrotic and cirrhotic tissues compared to normal human liver tissues, regardless of etiology (Fig. 1B).

Similar to the human data, PSMP expression was also markedly increased in mouse models of liver fibrosis induced by CCl4, BDL or DDC diet compared with the livers from control mice (Fig. 1C, D and Fig. S1).

These data indicated that PSMP signaling might be involved in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis.

To determine when and where PSMP is upregulated before fibrosis, we established 2 mouse acute liver injury models by CCl4 or APAP treatment.

We found that PSMP was already upregulated in the early stage of liver injury and predominantly expressed in the nonapoptotic area by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining (Fig. 1C, E and Fig. S1B).

Furthermore, the increased PSMP expression in the liver was localized mainly to albumin-expressing hepatocytes but not the α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)-expressing HSCs by double immunolabeling, indicating that hepatocytes are major producers of PSMP (Fig. 1E).

Accordingly, fractionated mouse primary hepatocytes were found to produce PSMP upon CCl4, APAP, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) protein, interleukin (IL)-33 and IL-1β stimulation (Fig. 1F, G, H).

SECTION

PSMP deficiency protects against liver fibrosis in mice

PARAGRAPH

To further examine the role of PSMP signaling in liver fibrosis, we first generated Psmp-/- mice using TALEN technology to delete 7 bases and mutate 1 base in exon 1 of the Psmp gene (Fig. S2).

PSMP was undetectable in the livers of Psmp-/- mice, indicating successful knockout (Fig. S1).

We then investigated fibrogenesis in Psmp-/- mice used to generate a toxic fibrosis mouse model induced by CCl4 treatment.

Mice were repetitively exposed to CCl4 for 4 weeks (2 times/week); similar to Ccr2-/- mice, Psmp-/- mice displayed significantly attenuated liver injury and fibrosis, as assessed by H&E and Sirius red staining, compared with oil controls (Fig. 2A, 2B).

Consistently, the upregulation of α-SMA, a marker of HSC activation, and hepatic hydroxyproline content was notably decreased in Psmp-/- mice (Fig. 2C, 2D).

The serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) showed a significant decrease in Psmp-/- mice, indicating improvement of liver damage (Fig. 2E).

Like Ccr2-/- mice, the hepatic mRNA expression of prototypical profibrotic genes (Acta2, Col1a1, Tgfb1, Timp1 and Pdgfr) were also reduced in CCl4-induced Psmp-/- mice (Fig. 2F).

PARAGRAPH

To further analyze the role of PSMP in liver fibrosis due to other causes, we employed the BDL mouse model and DDC-diet model, recapitulating clinical features of human biliary fibrosis.

Following BDL, Psmp-/- mice displayed a significant reduction of the Sirius red-positive area, hydroxyproline content, and α-SMA expression (Fig. 3A-D).

Serum ALT levels were lowered in Psmp-/- mice after BDL (Fig. 3E).

We observed a significant reduction in mRNA levels of Acta2, Col1a1 and Tgfb1 in Psmp-/- mice (Fig. 3F).

After 4 weeks of DDC feeding, Psmp-/- mice also displayed a significant reduction of the Sirius red-positive area and α-SMA expression (Fig. 3G-I).

However, serum ALT levels were compatible between WT and Psmp-/- mice (Fig. 3J), suggesting similar liver injury occurred.

We also observed a significant reduction in mRNA levels of Acta2, Col1a1, Tgfb1, Timp1 and Pdgfr in Psmp-/- mice (Fig. 3K).

PARAGRAPH

Taken together, these results suggest that activation of PSMP signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis.

SECTION

AAV8-hPSMP restores hepatic PSMP expression and promotes liver fibrosis in a CCR2-dependent manner

PARAGRAPH

Our results showed that the human and mouse PSMP proteins have common chemotactic activities and exhibit mouse monocyte chemotaxis in a CCR2-dependent manner in vitro (Fig. S3).

Therefore, we investigated whether human PSMP protein also affects liver fibrosis in mice.

Thus, we used AAV8 (a gene vector isolated from rhesus monkeys, which is used to transduce hepatocytes because of its high affinity for liver cells)35 to overexpress human PSMP in Psmp-/- mice (Fig. 4A).

As expected, Psmp-/- mice that received AAV8-hPSMP had strongly increased levels of hPSMP compared with those receiving a control AAV8-null (Fig. 4B).

Using this approach, we next examined the consequences of PSMP overexpression under conditions of chronic liver damage.

4 weeks after the AAV8 injection, the mice were treated with CCl4 for another 4 weeks to induce liver fibrosis (Fig. 4A).

We found a significant increase in liver injury and fibrosis elicited by PSMP overexpression compared to the effects observed in mice that were injected with AAV8-null (Fig. 4C-H).

To evaluate whether CCR2 was required for PSMP-promoted fibrosis, we generated PSMP- and CCR2-double-knockout mice by crossed Psmp-/- mice with Ccr2-/- mice.

The results showed that the double knockout of Psmp and Ccr2 did not reverse the attenuation of liver injury and fibrosis found in Psmp-/- mice (Fig. 4C-H).

PARAGRAPH

The data showed that PSMP overexpression promotes liver fibrosis development in a CCR2-dependent manner.

SECTION

Neutralization of PSMP signaling alleviates murine liver fibrosis

PARAGRAPH

Given that PSMP deficiency significantly attenuated the development of liver fibrosis in mice, we examined the effect of a specific PSMP-neutralizing antibody, 3D5, on liver fibrosis induced by CCl4.

We first investigated the protective effects of 3D5 on mice within 4 weeks of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis; mice were treated with 3D5 after each CCl4 injection (Fig. 5A).

H&E and Sirius red staining assays showed reduced liver injury and fibrosis after 3D5 treatment compared with that of the CCl4-treated group (Fig. 5B, C).

Accordingly, 3D5 notably reduced α-SMA expression and liver hydroxyproline content in the fibrotic livers (Fig. 5D, E).

Serum levels of ALT were significantly lower in the 3D5-treated group than in the CCl4-treated group, indicating an improvement in liver function (Fig. 5F).

qRT-PCR assays showed that 3D5 also significantly reduced the mRNA levels of fibrogenic genes (Acta2, Col1a1, Tgfb1, Timp1 and Pdgfr) (Fig. 5G).

PARAGRAPH

Moreover, to evaluate the therapeutic potential of 3D5, we used 3D5 treatment in mice from the 4th week to the 6th week with CCl4 treatment (Fig. 6A).

Mice treated with 3D5 displayed a significant reduction in the Sirius red-positive area, hydroxyproline content, α-SMA expression, and serum ALT compared with the CCl4-treated mice (Fig. 6B-F).

Consistently, we also found a significant reduction in Acta2, Col1a1, Tgfb1 and Pdgfr mRNA levels in mice treated with 3D5 (Fig. 6G).

PARAGRAPH

Different doses of 3D5 (1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg) were used to treat mice with CCl4-induced liver fibrosis (Fig. S4A).

H&E staining and Sirius red staining assays showed that mice with liver fibrosis that were treated with 3D5 had milder liver fibrosis (dose-dependent) than the CCl4-treated mice (Fig. S4B).

The levels of a-SMA, liver hydroxyproline content, serum ALT, and mRNA expression of fibrogenic genes (Acta2, Col1a1, Tgfb1, Timp1 and Pdgfr) in CCl4-treated mice were also dose-dependently decreased after 3D5 treatment (Fig. S4B-G).

PARAGRAPH

These results showed that blockade of PSMP signaling significantly ameliorated the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, consistent with the Psmp-/- results in mice, suggesting that the PSMP antibody could be a potential drug for liver fibrosis treatment.

SECTION

PSMP deficiency inhibits hepatic macrophage infiltration, M1 polarization and proinflammatory cytokine production induced by CCl4 challenge

PARAGRAPH

The infiltration of macrophages into the liver upon chronic injury has been convincingly linked to the progression of liver inflammation and fibrosis in mice and humans.3–5

Therefore, we investigated the composition of immune cells in the liver after CCl4 treatment by flow cytometric analysis.

Infiltrating hepatic macrophage (iMΦ, F4/80+ CD11bhi) and CD11b+CCR2+ cell accumulation were significantly reduced in Psmp-/- mice (Fig. 7A, B).

Parallel to the intrahepatic macrophages, we also investigated other immune cells, such as neutrophils (CD11b+ Ly6G+), B cells (B220+) and T cells (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+), which were not significantly affected except for some elevation or decrease of T cells in the Psmp-/- mice (Fig. S5).

PARAGRAPH

We next investigated the consequences of reduced hepatic macrophage accumulation due to PSMP deficiency in the liver.

An important function of hepatic macrophages during disease progression is the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines.3,4

Psmp-/- mice had decreased serum concentrations of CCL2, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-6 and TGF-β upon CCl4 treatment, which is consistent with the reduced numbers of intrahepatic macrophages (Fig. 7C).

PARAGRAPH

Further, to investigate whether PSMP deficiency influenced macrophage polarization, we measured expression of macrophage polarization markers in the fibrotic liver by qRT-PCR.

Compared with the WT mice, Psmp-/- mice expressed lower mRNA levels of Il-12 and iNOS (M1 marker) but higher mRNA levels of Cd206, Il-10 (M2 marker) (Fig. 7D).

SECTION

Treatment of mouse BMDMs with PSMP increases expression of M1 markers, while decreasing M2 markers expression

PARAGRAPH

Based on the results above, we investigated the direct effect of PSMP treatment on macrophage polarization in vitro, using WT bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs).

We measured the gene expression of M1/M2 polarization markers in macrophages by qRT-PCR.

Significantly increased expression of the M1 markers (Il-1β, Il-12) were observed following cell incubation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and recombinant PSMP protein.

In contrast, PSMP downregulated BMDM expression of the M2 markers (Cd206, Il-10 and Arg-1) following incubation with IL-4 (Fig. 7E).

Taken together these results suggest that PSMP promotes macrophage polarization to the proinflammatory M1-like phenotype.

PARAGRAPH

These data indicate that PSMP may promote fibrosis by affecting the infiltration and polarization of macrophages and then the production of proinflammatory cytokines.

SECTION

PSMP promotes HSC activation and survival

PARAGRAPH

CCR2 was shown to promote HSC activation and the development of hepatic fibrosis.17

We hypothesized that increased PSMP may regulate HSC activation.

In the current study, LX-2 (a human HSC line with key features of activated HSCs despite limitations due to immortalization)36 cells were treated with recombinant PSMP protein.

qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that PSMP significantly increased the mRNA levels of profibrogenic genes (ACTA2, COL1A1, TGFB) in LX-2 cells (Fig. 8A).

Additionally, the PSMP upregulated group pretreated with RS504393, which is an antagonist of CCR2, displayed reduced expression of the HSC activation markers in LX-2 cells, which indicated that PSMP directly promotes HSC activation through CCR2 (Fig. 8A).

The α-SMA positive HSCs are activated HSCs, which are the major fibrogenic populations during liver fibrosis development.

Compared with the CCl4-induced WT mice, TUNEL and immunohistochemical double immunolabeling demonstrated that the apoptosis of α-SMA positive HSCs significantly increased in the livers of CCl4-induced Psmp-/- mice (Fig. 8B).

PARAGRAPH

These results suggested that PSMP also promotes liver fibrosis through regulation of HSC activation and survival.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Liver fibrosis/cirrhosis is a major health problem worldwide, and there are currently no approved therapies.14

The CCR2-CCL2 pathway has been extensively confirmed in various experimental models of liver fibrosis using genetic deletion of CCR2 or pharmacological inhibition of CCL2, resulting in attenuation of liver fibrosis in mice.17–26

The dual CCR2/CCR5 antagonist CVC, as a antifibrotic agent for the treatment of alcohol-induced steatohepatitis and NASH with fibrosis, is currently being tested in a phase III trial.27–29

PSMP is a new ligand for CCR2, with a high affinity comparable to that of CCL2.31

In this study, we first found significantly enhanced PSMP expression in the livers of patients with fibrosis/cirrhosis.

We hypothesize that PSMP may play an important role in the development and progression of liver fibrosis.

PARAGRAPH

Early fibrosis becomes problematic and clinically relevant when dysregulated and excessive scarring occurs in response to persistent injury and leads to altered tissue function, eventually becoming cirrhotic.37

We found that PSMP was upregulated in the early stage of liver injury and continuously expressed in 3 experimental murine models: CCl4-, BDL- or DDC-diet-induced liver fibrosis.

To confirm the effect of upregulation of PSMP during liver fibrosis, we first used Psmp-/- mice to verify that genetic inactivation of Psmp attenuated chronic liver injury and fibrosis, leading to a recovery of liver function in mice.

Despite the possible redundancy of other CCR2 ligands in Psmp-/- mice, some of our data showed a lighter trend in liver fibrosis in Ccr2-/- mice.

Psmp-/- mice still displayed significantly attenuated liver injury and fibrosis similar to Ccr2-/- mice, indicating that PSMP, as a CCR2 key ligand, plays an essential role in liver injury and fibrosis.

Furthermore, overexpressing hPSMP in Psmp-/- mice by AAV8 vectors could reverse the attenuation of liver injury and fibrosis found in Psmp-/- mice, indicating that hPSMP could also promote liver fibrosis.

However, this effect was not observed in Psmp- and Ccr2-double-knockout mice, indicating that PSMP promotes liver fibrosis development in a CCR2-dependent manner.

These results confirmed that upregulation of PSMP indeed contributes to the development and progression of liver fibrosis.

PARAGRAPH

At the same time, we found that a PSMP-specific neutralizing antibody, 3D5, had significant in vivo antifibrotic activity along the same line, with fibrosis alleviation in Psmp-/- mice.

Our data showed that 3D5 significantly reduced liver fibrosis and rescued hepatic function.

We used 2 treatment protocols: the protective treatment and the therapeutic treatment, both treatment models showed reduced liver injury and fibrosis after 3D5 treatment.

To further assess the therapeutic effect of PSMP antibody on liver fibrosis, we used different doses of 3D5 to treat mice with CCl4-induced liver fibrosis.

The results showed that the degree of liver fibrosis was reduced by 3D5 in a dose-dependent manner.

These findings indicated that PSMP could be a new therapeutic target for liver fibrosis and that the PSMP antibody is a potential treatment option of liver fibrosis.

PARAGRAPH

Based on the results that PSMP was already upregulated in the early stage of liver injury and predominantly expressed in the nonapoptotic area by TUNEL staining, we further explore the mechanism of PSMP overexpression.

Excessive cell death and the release of DAMPs has been identified as a central mechanism of liver damage in both acute and chronic liver diseases.38,39

We then found that the increased PSMP expression in the liver was localized mainly to hepatocytes by double immunolabeling.

Fractionated primary hepatocytes were found to produce PSMP upon the stimulation of CCl4, APAP and DAMP molecules HMGB-1 or IL-33, but not HSP70, ATP and S1P.

Therefore, our results suggest that PSMP is a damage-induced chemotactic cytokine.

PARAGRAPH

To further explore the mechanism of PSMP in liver fibrosis, we characterized and identified PSMP-mediated effects on macrophages and HSCs.

During liver injury, PSMP could chemoattract CCR2+ monocytes from blood to the injured liver and then differentiate into macrophages to promote liver inflammation.

PSMP deficiency inhibits hepatic macrophage infiltration, M1 polarization and proinflammatory cytokine production.

We next investigated the direct effect of PSMP treatment on macrophage polarization in vitro.

The results suggest that PSMP promotes macrophage polarization to the proinflammatory M1-like phenotype.

Despite the critical role of proinflammatory monocytes in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, HSCs are the most relevant profibrogenic cells.

Previous studies have shown that macrophage infiltration and proinflammatory cytokines protected against the death of activated HSCs.5,13

Consistent with these findings, our data demonstrated that the apoptosis of activated HSCs significantly increased in the livers of CCl4-induced Psmp-/- mice.

In addition, CCR2 was shown to be expressed on HSCs, and CCL2 directly activated HSCs.17,20

We then tested the effects of recombinant PSMP protein in human LX-2 cells.

The results showed that PSMP can directly activate LX-2 cells in a CCR2-dependent manner.

Taken together, these data indicate that PSMP as a chemotactic cytokine not only promotes inflammation and survival of activated HSCs but also directly activates HSCs.

PARAGRAPH

Thus, we developed the following working model for the role of PSMP in the progression of liver injury and fibrosis.

When hepatocytes are injured, DAMP molecules such as HMGB-1 and IL-33 are released.

These molecules induce the production of PSMP by hepatocytes.

Sustained cell damage signaling and increased PSMP expression promote inflammatory macrophage infiltration, M1 polarization and proinflammatory cytokine secretion.

PSMP also directly activates quiescent HSCs via CCR2.

Moreover, activated HSCs become myofibroblasts that are responsible for the excess deposition of ECM.

Eventually, all of these fibrogenesis-promoting effects contribute to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.

In therapeutic applications, combining the characteristics that PSMP is lowly expressed in multiple normal tissues31 and damage-induced in liver injury and fibrosis tissues may provide long-term therapeutic safety and tolerability for targeted PSMP.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, PSMP was highly expressed in fibrotic/cirrhotic liver tissues from patients with different etiologies of liver disease.

The upregulation of PSMP contributes to the development and progression of liver fibrosis in a CCR2-dependent manner.

PSMP promotes liver fibrosis through inflammatory macrophage infiltration, M1 polarization and proinflammatory cytokines, as well as direct activation of HSCs via CCR2.

A PSMP antibody reduced liver fibrosis development in vivo.

These findings indicate that PSMP may be a potential therapeutic target and its antibody may be a potential therapeutic agent for liver fibrosis.
