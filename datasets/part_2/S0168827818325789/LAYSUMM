TITLE

Evaluating the landscape of gene cooperativity with receptor tyrosine kinases in liver tumorigenesis using transposon-mediated mutagenesis

PARAGRAPH

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are among signals frequently deregulated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and their deregulation confers essential biological properties to cancer cells.

We have applied a genetic method to randomly mutate large numbers of genes in the context of a mouse model with increased RTK levels, predisposed to develop liver cancer.

We identified mechanisms that accelerate tumour formation in cooperation with enhanced RTK levels.

The wide array of cellular functions among these cooperators illustrates an extraordinary capability of RTKs to render the liver more vulnerable to additional alterations, by priming cells for tumour initiation.
