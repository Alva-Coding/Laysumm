TITLE

Targeting the crosstalk between cytokine-induced killer cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in hepatocellular carcinoma

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common and fatal cancer, with an increasing incidence worldwide.1

Though many curative therapies have been developed, the overall response to these therapies is inadequate and the long-term prognosis of patients with HCC remains poor because of its high recurrence rates.2

A lot of data have shown that tumor progression is correlated with the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) which induce local and possibly systemic immunosuppression.3

Moreover, a greater prevalence of MDSCs has been correlated with early recurrence and was shown to be a predictor of poor prognosis in patients with HCC who underwent curative resection,4 radiotherapy,5 and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy.6

MDSCs have been shown to suppress CD8+7–9 and CD4+ T10 cells as well as natural killer (NK)11 cells through diverse direct or indirect mechanisms.12

PARAGRAPH

Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells are a mixed cell population of effector cells with diverse T cell receptor specificities that also possess non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic activity against tumor cells.

CIK cells, which comprise cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, and NK-like T cells that express both NK- and T-cell markers are expanded ex vivo using recombinant IFN-γ, IL-2 and anti-CD3.13

CIK cell-based immunotherapies have been widely studied and used in the treatment of patients with cancer, including HCC.14

Currently, 90 registered clinical trials are listed on the ClinicalTrials.gov website (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) when the following keywords are used in the search: cytokine-induced killer cells or CIK.15

PARAGRAPH

A recent study determined that adjuvant immunotherapy using CIK cells appeared to reduce the recurrence of HCC and to improve overall survival.16

Although adjuvant CIK cell-based immunotherapy is a promising treatment option for early stage HCC, it lacks efficacy in advanced HCC.17–19

We hypothesized that CIK cells could trigger a counter-regulatory immunosuppressive mechanism through recruitment of MDSCs that might hinder CIK cell antitumor activity.

PARAGRAPH

We show that adoptive CIK cell therapy leads to an accumulation of MDSCs in the tumor microenvironment, which in turn suppress CIK function.

We demonstrate that a PDE5 inhibitor can not only suppress MDSCs accumulation and function, but also enhance CIK cell-based therapy in murine HCC tumor models.

Finally, our murine data were corroborated by human in vitro data using human CIK and tumor cells as well as MDSCs treated with a PDE5 inhibitor.

SECTION

Animal studies

PARAGRAPH

Male and female C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were obtained from NCI/Frederick (Frederick, MD, USA).

Male B6(Cg)-Tyrc-2J/J (B6-albino) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, USA).

All mice were group-housed (5 mice per cage) and were maintained under a 12 h light – 12 h dark cycle with free access to water and standard mouse chow.

Subcutaneous tumors were established by injection of 1 × 106 RIL-175 or 1 × 106 BNL cells into the left flank of C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice, respectively.

Mice with tumor sizes between 150 and 200 mm3 were randomly assigned to 4 groups with 5 mice per group.

Tumor volume was blindly measured using calipers every 3 days and calculated according to the formula: length × width2/2 mm3.

Data are reported as the average tumor size ± standard error of mean (SEM).

To induce orthotopic tumors, 1 × 105 RIL-175 cells in 20 µl of a 50:50 solution of PBS and Matrigel (or only phosphate buffered saline [PBS] as a control) were injected under the liver capsule into the left lobe of the liver of anesthetized recipient 5-week-old male B6(Cg)-Tyrc-2J/J (B6-albino) mice after subcostal laparotomy.20

The establishment and growth of tumors were monitored by bioluminescent imaging (BLI) using the Xenogen in vivo imaging system (IVIS Spectrum; Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA, USA).

BLI was blindly performed on days 7, 14, and 21 using the IVIS Spectrum Imaging System as previously reported.23

Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in oxygen at 2 L/min.

Ten minutes after the mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 150 mg/kg of D-luciferin in PBS, bioluminescence images were acquired with an exposure time of 1–120 s, medium binning, 1f/stop, with an open filter.

A region of interest (ROI) was drawn around the tumor, and the bioluminescence signal was quantified as photons/s/cm2/steradian (p/s/cm2/sr).23

Intrahepatic orthotopic tumors were allowed to grow for 7 days, at which point the mice were randomized into 4 groups with 5 mice per group according to the bioluminescence signal.

Then, based on their group, the mice were administered 5 × 106 CIK cells intravenously in the tail vein and/or a PDE5 inhibitor.

Tadalafil (Selleckchem, TX, USA), a PDE5 inhibitor, was administered daily by i.p. injection (2 mg/kg/24 h).22

Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and received humane care according to institutional guidelines.

Tissues were fixed and stained with anti-Ly6G (clone 6D17, Acris Antibodies GmbH, Germany).

The analyses of stained tissues are described in the supplementary information.

All experiments were performed according to institutional guidelines and were approved by an NCI-Bethesda (Bethesda, MD, USA) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

The sample size for the animal studies was guided by a previous study in our laboratory in which the same C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice strains were used.24

No animals were excluded.

Randomization was performed during the in vivo study.

Measurements were performed in a blind manner whenever possible.

Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism v7.03 (GraphPad Software).

The significance of the difference between groups was calculated by Student’s unpaired t test, 1-way or 2-way ANOVA (Tukey’s and Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test).

Welch’s corrections were used when variances between groups were unequal.

p <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

SECTION

CIK cell therapy recruits MDSCs to tumor tissues

PARAGRAPH

We tested the effect of adoptive CIK cell therapy in a murine subcutaneous HCC model using RIL-175-derived tumors.

CIK cells were generated from splenocytes of tumor-free C57BL/6 mice (Fig. S1) and CIK cell therapy was initiated 2 weeks after injection of RIL-175 cells when the tumors were palpable (average tumor volume: 50 mm3).

As shown in Fig. 1A, CIK cell therapy caused only marginal inhibition of subcutaneous tumor growth (p = 0.0369).

We studied the tumor microenvironment by quantitative real-time PCR and noticed an increase in CD11b by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 1B) in liver tumors after adoptive cell therapy with CIK cells.

Based on these findings, we performed flow cytometry on tumor-infiltrating immune cells and assessed MDSCs (Fig. S2).

The numbers of both CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6Clow polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSCs and CD11b+Ly6G−Ly6Chigh monocytic (M)-MDSCs were increased in tumors after adoptive CIK cell therapy (p <0.05, Fig. 1C).

In contrast, a reduction in both CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6Clow PMN-MDSCs and CD11b+Ly6G−Ly6Chigh M-MDSCs was observed in the spleens of mice after adoptive CIK cell transfer (p <0.05, Fig. 1D).

PARAGRAPH

To better understand the mechanism by which MDSCs accumulated in these HCC models upon adoptive CIK cell therapy, we studied cytokines upon co-culture of CIKs with tumor cells and found CX3CL1 and IL-13, which are 2 cytokines that are known to be related to MDSCs trafficking to the tumor site (Fig. 1E).25,26

SECTION

MDSCs inhibit the tumor lytic function of CIK cells against HCC

PARAGRAPH

Since adoptive CIK cell therapy showed only limited antitumor effects and since we also observed an increase in the number of tumor-infiltrating MDSCs upon treatment, we tested whether MDSCs can impair CIK cell cytotoxicity.

We generated murine CIK cells from splenocytes of tumor-free C57BL/6 mice (Fig. S1) and isolated murine CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6Clow PMN-MDSCs and CD11b+Ly6G−Ly6Chigh M-MDSCs from RIL-175 tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice (Fig. S3).

CIK lytic activity was tested against RIL-175 HCC tumor cells in the presence or absence of both MDSC subsets.

Naïve splenocytes were used as a control for MDSCs.

A dose-dependent suppression of CIK cell cytotoxicity was observed when CIK cells were co-cultured with either PMN-MDSCs or M-MDSCs, even at a 10:1 CIK to MDSCs ratio (Fig. 2A and B).

However, no suppression was observed when CIK cells were co-cultured with splenocytes.

In addition, MDSCs did not lyse CIK cells or RIL-175 cells at any ratio tested (data not shown).

We repeated this experiment using BALB/c mice and a different HCC cell line (BNL cells).20

CIK cells were generated from BALB/c mice (Fig. S4), and PMN- and M-MDSCs were isolated from BNL-tumor-bearing BALB/c mice (Fig. S5).

As shown, both MDSC subsets impaired CIK cell cytotoxicity against BNL tumor cells (Fig. S6A and B).

Together, our results show that MDSCs efficiently impair the cytotoxicity of CIK cells against 2 different murine HCC cell lines.

SECTION

Simultaneous ARG1 and iNOS inhibition by tadalafil rescues CIK cell function from suppression by MDSCs

PARAGRAPH

Next, we studied the mechanism by which MDSCs inhibit CIK cell function.

The roles of arginase 1 (ARG1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS [NOS2]), which are part of 2 major suppression pathways used by MDSCs, were assessed using N-omega-hydroxy-L-arginine (L-NOHA, an ARG1-specific inhibitor) and/or N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, an iNOS inhibitor).

Although treatment with L-NMMA or L-NOHA alone only partially reversed the inhibition of CIK cell cytotoxicity against RIL-175 HCC cells by both MDSC subsets (L-NMMA, 30.1% for PMN-MDSCs and 31.6% for M-MDSCs; L-NOHA, 43.1% for PMN-MDSCs and 29.1% for M-MDSCs), the combined treatment achieved ∼51.7% of cytotoxicity (Fig. 3A and B).

This suggests that simultaneous ARG1 and iNOS inhibition is a good strategy by which the tumor lytic function of CIK cells may be rescued from suppression by MDSCs.

PARAGRAPH

Tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor approved by the FDA, has been shown to suppress MDSC function through the downregulation of both ARG1 and iNOS expression.22

Therefore, we tested the possibility of using a single treatment of tadalafil to block both ARG1 and iNOS and to rescue CIK cell function.

Indeed, tadalafil efficiently restored the tumor lytic activity of CIK cells from either PMN-MDSCs or M-MDSCs by achieving up to 51.6% of cytotoxicity (Fig. 3A and B).

No additional effect was found when tadalafil was combined with L-NOHA and/or L-NMMA (Fig. 3A and B), which indicates that tadalafil functions through the blockade of ARG1 and iNOS.

PARAGRAPH

We obtained similar results using BNL HCC tumor cells with CIK cells and MDSCs generated from BALB/c mice (Fig. S7A and B), showing this finding was not dependent on mouse strain or a specific HCC tumor type.

In addition, neither tadalafil, L-NMMA nor L-NOHA had any direct effects on the CIK cell dependent lysis of 2 different HCC murine cell lines (Fig. S8A and B).

SECTION

Tadalafil simultaneously suppresses the number and function of MDSCs

PARAGRAPH

Next, we tested the effect of tadalafil in a murine subcutaneous HCC model using RIL-175 tumors.

Tadalafil therapy was initiated 2 weeks after injection of RIL-175 cells when the tumors were palpable (average tumor volume: 50 mm3).

After 5 days of treatment with tadalafil alone, the subcutaneous tumor volumes were similar to those of control mice (Fig. 4A).

However, when we studied tumor-infiltrating MDSCs in these mice, the numbers of both CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6Clow PMN-MDSCs and CD11b+Ly6G−Ly6Chigh M-MDSCs were significantly decreased in tumors after tadalafil single treatment (p <0.05, Fig. 4B).

Similarly, a reduction in both CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6Clow PMN-MDSCs and CD11b+Ly6G−Ly6Chigh M-MDSCs was observed in the spleens of mice after a single tadalafil treatment (Fig. 4C).

The assessment of intratumoral MDSC infiltration by quantitative real-time PCR to detect CD11b (p <0.05, Fig. 4D) revealed a significant reduction in intratumoral MDSCs, which was consistent with the flow cytometric observations.

PARAGRAPH

To better understand the biology of MDSC reduction in the HCC model using RIL-175 tumors, we obtained serum from mice 5 days after the single tadalafil treatment.

Serum was tested in a cytokine array, which revealed a decrease in cytokines, including CX3CL1 and IL-13, in the tadalafil group compared with the control group (Fig. 4E).

PARAGRAPH

In addition, both MDSC subsets isolated from tadalafil-treated mice did not suppress CIK cell cytotoxicity against RIL-175 HCC cells at any ratio tested (Fig. 4F and G).

SECTION

Tadalafil enhances the antitumor efficacy of CIK cells in vivo

PARAGRAPH

Next, we tested whether tadalafil treatment could be used to enhance the efficacy of CIK cell therapy for HCC in male C57BL/6 mice bearing subcutaneous RIL-175 tumors.

Compared with the controls, a single therapy of CIK cells or tadalafil caused only a mild suppression of tumor growth (Fig. 5A and B).

In contrast, the combination of tadalafil and adoptive CIK cell therapy led to clear tumor growth inhibition (Fig. 5A and B).

Similar results were found in male BALB/c mice bearing subcutaneous BNL tumors (Fig. 5C and D), female C57BL/6 mice (Fig. S9A and B), and female BALB/c mice (Fig. S9C and D).

Again, in all the tested tumor models using 2 different HCC murine cell lines, 2 different mouse strains, and male and female mice, a consistent increase in both CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6Clow PMN-MDSCs and CD11b+Ly6G−Ly6Chigh M-MDSCs levels after CIK cell single therapy was observed in tumor tissues.

This increase was reversed by combination therapy with tadalafil (Fig. S10).

In contrast to tumor tissues, fewer CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6Clow PMN-MDSCs and CD11b+Ly6G−Ly6Chigh M-MDSCs were found in the spleen after CIK cell therapy (Fig. S11).

PARAGRAPH

Next, we established an orthotopic HCC model by direct injection of RIL-175 cells into mouse livers to study the effect of immunotherapy in a model that more closely resembles the condition of patients with HCC.

We took advantage of the fact that RIL-175 cells express luciferase,27 which enabled us to monitor the growth of liver tumors by in vivo imaging.

The imaging analysis showed that CIK cells or tadalafil treatment alone inhibited liver tumor progression, which was consistent with the observation in the subcutaneous tumor model.

However, the combined treatment with tadalafil plus adoptive cell therapy with CIK cells elicited the strongest antitumor effect (Fig. 6A and B).

At the experimental endpoint, intrahepatic tumor tissues were harvested for further evaluation.

As shown, combination treatment (CIK cells + tadalafil) significantly reduced both the liver/body weight ratio and the tumor/liver weight ratio (Fig. 6C and D).

We also studied tumor-infiltrating MDSCs.

Similar to our findings in subcutaneous tumors, CIK cell treatment caused an induction of both the CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6Clow PMN-MDSC and CD11b+Ly6G−Ly6Chigh M-MDSC populations in liver tumors (Fig. 6E).

In contrast, tadalafil treatment reversed the accumulation of tumor-infiltrating MDSCs in response to CIK cell therapy and provided additional protection against HCC (Fig. 6E).

However, similar to our findings in subcutaneous tumor models, MDSCs were decreased in splenic tissues in response to CIK cell therapy (Fig. 6F).

Together, the results from 2 different murine HCC cell lines and those from subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor models suggest that targeting MDSCs improves the efficacy of CIK cell therapy against HCC.

SECTION

Human MDSCs inhibit human CIK cell cytotoxicity

PARAGRAPH

To confirm the above findings in human samples, we generated human CIK cells (Fig. S12) and isolated human CD14+HLA-DR−/low MDSCs (Fig. S13) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

CD14+HLA-DR−/low cells significantly suppressed the cytotoxicity of human CIK cells against the human HCC cell lines, Hep3B (Fig. 7A) and PLC/PRF/5 (Fig. 7B), whereas the control CD14+HLA-DR+ monocytes did not show any significant effect.

The inhibition of human CIK cells by human MDSCs (CD14+HLA-DR−/low) is primarily dependent on ARG1 and iNOS (Fig. 7C and D).

As expected, tadalafil restored the tumor lytic function of CIK cells against both Hep3B (Fig. 7C) and PLC/PRF/5 (Fig. 7D) HCC cells.

No further abrogation of the suppressive activity of MDSCs against CIK cells by tadalafil was observed in the presence of L-NOHA and/or L-NMMA.

Similar to our findings in murine studies, tadalafil, L-NMMA, and L-NOHA had no direct effect on the lytic function of CIK cells when 2 different human HCC cell lines were tested (Fig. S14A and B).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

With the recent FDA approval of nivolumab for the treatment of patients with HCC who have been previously treated with sorafenib, immunotherapy has become a standard of care treatment option for HCC.

Despite encouraging results from different clinical studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors,28,29 other types of immunotherapies including adoptive cell therapy remain of great interest.30,31

CIK cells have been shown to be active in an adjuvant setting.16

Here, we studied the immune-mediated mechanism that suppresses the function of CIK-based therapies and tested how the immunosuppressive mechanism can be overcome using drugs already approved by the FDA with the intent to rapidly bring these approaches into the clinic.

PARAGRAPH

In this study, we unexpectedly observed that adoptive CIK cell therapy recruits MDSCs to tumor tissue.

Functional studies demonstrated that MDSCs can suppress the lytic function of CIK cells against HCC through ARG1 and iNOS.

With 2 different murine HCC cell lines, subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor models, using 2 different mouse strains, we provide evidence that systemic PDE5 therapy with tadalafil, an FDA-approved drug, improves the antitumor effect of CIK cells against HCC.

This is accompanied by a reduction in the number and impairment of the function of tumor-infiltrating MDSCs.

Thus, this study suggests that targeting MDSCs is an effective strategy by which the efficacy of CIK cell-based immunotherapy in the treatment of patients with HCC can be improved.

PARAGRAPH

The interest in immunotherapy for the treatment of HCC has recently garnered substantial attention with the approval of nivolumab for the treatment of patients with HCC who have progressed on sorafenib therapy.32

While the primary focus of this particular study was not to examine MDSCs in HCC, it should be noted that single-agent targeting of MDSCs using a PDE5 inhibitor caused a delay in tumor growth in both murine HCC models described here (Figs. 5 and 6).

This result suggests that MDSCs not only potently suppress antitumor immunity in HCC but also that targeting these cells may significantly enhance different types of immunotherapy in HCC.

PARAGRAPH

A recent series of prospective randomized trials and retrospective studies showed that adjuvant CIK cell-based immunotherapy can significantly improve prognosis in patients with early stage HCC who have undergone curative treatments including hepatic resection and radiofrequency ablation.16,33,34

However, the survival benefits of adjuvant CIK cell-based immunotherapy for patients with advanced-stage HCC remain uncertain.18,19

As in many other types of cancer, MDSCs levels increase dramatically during HCC progression,25,35–39 and MDSCs inhibit both T cells and NK cells in patients with HCC.11,37,40

We propose that suppression of MDSCs using PDE5 inhibitors may represent a new approach to enhance CIK cell-based immunotherapy in HCC.

This concept is also supported by studies in other types of cancer, where chemotherapy is routinely used.41–43

In those studies, different types of chemotherapy (gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) have been shown to reduce the number of MDSCs and increase the efficacy of CIK cell-based immunotherapy.

However, a reduction in MDSCs in those cases may have simply resulted from successful chemotherapy and tumor shrinkage, which would have led to a small number of MDSCs.

PARAGRAPH

Here, our study provides direct pre-clinical evidence that simultaneous reduction in MDSC number and function by an FDA-approved PDE5 inhibitor improved CIK cell-based therapy for HCC.

Moreover, this information will help clinicians design better clinical trials to test CIK cell-based therapies in patients with HCC.

PARAGRAPH

One major finding was the observed increase in MDSC numbers in the tumor tissues of mice upon adoptive transfer of CIK cells (Figs. 1D and 6E).

A similar observation has been described in adoptive T cell therapy.44

It has been speculated that cytokines and/or chemokines released in response to adoptive CIK cell therapy recruit MDSCs to the tumor tissues.

It remains to be determined which factors, if any, might affect the recruitment of MDSCs after CIK cell therapy.

However, clearly, CX3CL1 and IL-3 play an important role in the accumulation of MDSCs at the tumor site, which was associated with CIK cell therapy in this study.25,26

One limitation of our murine models is that subcutaneous tumors do not reflect the situation of HCC that arises in the liver.

To overcome this limitation, we established an orthotopic HCC model to better mimic the condition of patients with HCC.

PARAGRAPH

Although we have shown that a PDE5 inhibitor, tadalafil, suppressed MDSCs in an iNOS- and ARG1-dependent manner, the full mechanism that underlies these effects remains to be elucidated.

One putative mechanism involves the impact of these inhibitors on mRNA stability.

cGMP destabilizes iNOS mRNA by reducing the ubiquitous mRNA binding protein, human antigen R.45 The other possibility is that high levels of cGMP induced by a PDE5 blockade reduce the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration,46 which leads to a reduction in the activity of calcium-dependent protein kinase C,47 this in turn prevents the upregulation of IL-4Rα and ARG1.48

PARAGRAPH

Further work is required to elucidate the exact mechanism by which MDSCs suppress CIK cells.

Additional studies are also needed to determine whether CIK cells can also affect MDSCs in patients with HCC.

The multifaceted role of MDSCs further illustrates the complexity of the immune-suppressive mechanisms in patients with HCC, and consequently, the necessity to design new CIK cell-based immunotherapies that target these pathways.

PARAGRAPH

In summary, our study has uncovered a novel mechanism of immune evasion for HCC tumors whereby MDSCs regulate adoptive immunotherapy and its effector cells, the CIK cells.

Impaired CIK cells can in turn affect the antitumor immune responses, which further contributes to tumor escape from CIK cell-based immunotherapy in patients with advanced HCC.
