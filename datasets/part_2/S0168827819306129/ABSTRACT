ABSTRACT

TITLE

Simplified monitoring for hepatitis C virus treatment with glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir, a randomised non-inferiority trial

PARAGRAPH

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for HCV has high efficacy and limited toxicity.

We hypothesised that the efficacy of glecaprevir-pibrentasvir for chronic HCV with a simplified treatment monitoring schedule would be non-inferior to a standard treatment monitoring schedule.

PARAGRAPH

In this open-label multicentre phase IIIb trial, treatment-naïve adults with chronic HCV without cirrhosis were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive glecaprevir-pibrentasvir 300 mg–120 mg daily for 8 weeks administered with a simplified or standard monitoring strategy.

Clinic visits occurred at baseline and post-treatment week 12 in the simplified arm, and at baseline, week 4, week 8, and post-treatment week 12 in the standard arm.

Study nurse phone contact occurred at week 4 and week 8 in both arms.

Participants requiring adherence support were not eligible, including those reporting recent injecting drug use.

The primary endpoint was sustained virological response at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12), with a non-inferiority margin of 6%.

PARAGRAPH

Overall, 380 participants (60% male, 47% genotype 1, 32% genotype 3) with chronic HCV were randomised and treated with glecaprevir-pibrentasvir in the simplified (n = 253) and standard (n = 127) arms.

In the intention-to-treat population, SVR12 was 92% (95% CI 89%–95%) in the simplified and 95% (95% CI 92%–99%) in the standard arm (difference between arms −3.2%; 95% CI −8.2% to 1.8%) and did not reach non-inferiority.

In the per-protocol population, SVR12 was 97% (95% CI 96%–99%) in the simplified and 98% (95% CI 96%–100%) in the standard arm.

No treatment-related serious adverse events were reported.

PARAGRAPH

In patients with chronic HCV infection without cirrhosis, treatment with glecaprevir-pibrentasvir was safe and effective.

In comparison to standard monitoring, a simplified monitoring schedule did not achieve non-inferiority.
