TITLE

Simplified monitoring for hepatitis C virus treatment with glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir, a randomised non-inferiority trial

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Globally, an estimated 71 million people have chronic HCV infection.1

HCV treatment was interferon-based for more than 2 decades, with the addition of ribavirin,2 pegylated-interferon,3 and first-generation protease inhibitor direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies (telaprevir, boceprevir),4,5 providing stepwise improvements in efficacy as defined by sustained virological response (SVR).

Despite these improvements, treatment uptake remained low in most countries, with <1% to 5% of people with chronic HCV initiating therapy each year.6

PARAGRAPH

Recent years have seen a revolution in HCV therapeutic development, with the availability of interferon-free DAA regimens.7

Simple (once daily dosing oral regimens), well tolerated, short duration (8–12 weeks), pangenotypic DAA therapy with high efficacy (cure rates above 95%) is now standard of care for chronic HCV.

The broad implementation of DAA therapy has considerable public health potential, with the World Health Organization setting ambitious HCV elimination impact targets for reductions in HCV incidence (80%) and liver disease mortality (65%) by 2030.8

PARAGRAPH

The capacity to scale-up DAA therapy should be enhanced by simplified treatment monitoring strategies.

The coformulation of glecaprevir-pibrentasvir, an NS3/4a protease inhibitor and NS5A inhibitor combination, provides key features for HCV treatment simplification, including on-treatment monitoring: i) pan-genotypic activity with high efficacy; ii) minimal drug-related toxicity; iii) ease of dosing (3 pills once daily); and iv) short duration (8 weeks for patients without cirrhosis).

In phase III clinical trials in patients without cirrhosis, an 8-week regimen of glecaprevir-pibrentasvir (300 mg–120 mg) led to SVR rates of 95–100% in HCV genotypes 1–6.9,10

PARAGRAPH

We hypothesised that a simplified monitoring schedule would be non-inferior to a standard monitoring strategy in terms of SVR at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12), in treatment-naïve patients with chronic HCV (genotypes 1–6).

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Study design and randomisation

PARAGRAPH

In this open-label international multicentre phase IIIb trial, treatment-naïve adults with chronic HCV and without cirrhosis were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive glecaprevir-pibrentasvir 300 mg–120 mg for 8 weeks administered with a simplified or standard monitoring strategy (SMART-C; Fig. 1).

Randomisation was computer-generated and stratified according to HCV genotype (genotype 1 or non-genotype 1) and country.

The treatment assignments were not concealed.

Glecaprevir-pibrentasvir was administered orally once daily as 3 fixed-dose combination tablets containing 100 mg of glecaprevir and 40 mg of pibrentasvir, for a total daily dose of 300 mg of glecaprevir and 120 mg of pibrentasvir.

SECTION

Participants

PARAGRAPH

From 21 August 2017 to 16 July 2018, participants were screened and enrolled at 33 sites in Australia (n = 6), Canada (n = 7), France (n = 3), Germany (n = 4), New Zealand (n = 4), Switzerland (n = 2), the United Kingdom (n = 3), and the United States (n = 4).

Study recruitment was conducted through a network of tertiary specialist viral hepatitis clinics (n = 30), and primary care clinics (n = 3).

Scheduled study follow-up continued through 14 December 2018, when the final participant enrolled was assessed for SVR12.

PARAGRAPH

Participants who were at least 18 years of age were eligible for participation if they had chronic HCV genotypes 1–6, were HCV treatment-naïve (interferon-based or DAA) and did not have cirrhosis.

The absence of cirrhosis in all participants was assessed by means of transient elastography or aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI).

The absence of cirrhosis was defined as a liver stiffness measurement by transient hepatic elastography of <12.5 kPa or APRI of <1.0.

Individuals receiving opiate agonist therapy and those with HIV coinfection were eligible.

Participants who were considered by their clinician to require additional treatment adherence support were not eligible, although a standardised adherence assessment tool was not used across sites.

The suitability for enrolment in relation to perceived adherence support needs was based on clinical judgement and was at the discretion of the site investigator, reflecting clinical practice and enhancing generalisability.

Participants who self-reported injecting drug use within the previous 6 months or those who tested positive on urinary drug screen at screening were not eligible.

Individuals with acute or chronic HBV coinfection (HBsAg positive) were excluded.

Participants with prior HBV infection (HBsAg negative, antibody to HBcAg positive) were eligible.

Full eligibility criteria are provided in the study protocol, available with the full text of this article in the supplementary files.

SECTION

Study assessments

PARAGRAPH

In the standard arm, scheduled clinic study visits were undertaken at baseline, treatment weeks 4 and 8 (end of treatment), and post-treatment week 12.

In the simplified arm, scheduled clinic study visits were undertaken at baseline and post-treatment week 12.

Assessments at these visits included measurement of vital signs, symptom-directed physical examinations, assessment of HCV RNA, and standard laboratory testing.

In the standard arm, study drug was dispensed at baseline and treatment week 4.

In the simplified arm, study drug was fully dispensed at baseline.

To standardise reporting and data collection, in both the standard and simplified arms, phone contact was initiated by the study nurse at weeks 4 and 8 (end of treatment) to monitor treatment adherence and adverse events using a structured case report form and questionnaire.

For participants in the standard arm, phone contact was initiated 1 to 2 days prior to their planned clinic visit at weeks 4 and 8.

All adverse events were recorded and graded according to a standard scale (see study protocol for details).

Study drug adherence was assessed by self-reported adherence questionnaires at weeks 4 and 8 (phone contact), and pill count at week 8 (standard arm) or post-treatment week 12 (simplified arm).

Participants were asked to return study drug packaging (and any unused medication) at end of treatment (standard arm) or post-treatment week 12 (simplified arm), with the number of pills returned recorded by the site coordinator and pharmacist.

PARAGRAPH

The presence of HCV RNA in plasma was assessed at all scheduled clinic study visits using Aptima HCV Quant Dx assay, version 2.15.5 (lower limit of quantification [LLoQ] 10 IU/ml; Hologic, Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA), with centralised testing performed at St Vincent’s Centre for Applied Medical Research (Sydney, NSW, Australia).

Reverse transcription of RNA with random hexamers was performed using the Invitrogen Superscript™ system (Vilo IV), and the Core-E2, NS5A and NS3 HCV regions were amplified by PCR.11,12

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Australian Genome Research Facility on the Applied Biosystems™ 3730xl DNA Analyzer.

Sequence curation was performed using RECall.13

The presence of polymorphisms in NS3 and NS5A at baseline was evaluated using Geno2PhenoHCV.

Among participants with virological failure, substitutions (relative to an individual’s baseline HCV sequence) that developed on-treatment were examined.

SECTION

Study definitions

PARAGRAPH

Stage of liver fibrosis was assessed by liver stiffness measurement (transient elastography [FibroScan®]) or APRI.

For liver stiffness measurements, the chosen cut-offs for significant liver fibrosis and cirrhosis were 7.1 kPa and 12.5 kPa, respectively.14

APRI below 1.0 excluded cirrhosis with high specificity.15

PARAGRAPH

HCV virological suppression was defined as HCV RNA below the LLoQ.

An end of treatment response was defined as HCV RNA below the LLoQ (target not detected or target detected, not quantifiable) at the end of treatment (date of treatment cessation).

PARAGRAPH

HCV treatment outcome was classified as SVR12 (defined as HCV RNA below the LLoQ at or after 12 weeks post cessation of treatment), virologic failure (HCV RNA above the LLoQ at 12 weeks post cessation of treatment with reinfection excluded on sequencing) or non-virologic failure (including reinfection, death, premature treatment discontinuation, loss to follow-up or missing HCV RNA values).

In the standard monitoring arm, HCV virologic failure was further defined as on-treatment failure (non-response or breakthrough) or post-treatment relapse (presence of quantifiable HCV RNA after end of treatment with detection of infection with an HCV strain consistent with the primary infecting strain, confirmed as homologous virus on sequencing).

Reinfection was defined as HCV RNA above the LLoQ after end of treatment with detection of infection with an HCV strain that was distinct from the primary infecting strain, confirmed as heterologous virus on sequencing.

SECTION

Study endpoints

PARAGRAPH

The primary endpoint was SVR12 by intention-to-treat following glecaprevir-pibrentasvir for 8 weeks, administered with a standard or simplified monitoring schedule, in patients with chronic HCV who were treatment naïve and did not have cirrhosis.

Secondary endpoints included premature treatment discontinuation, treatment adherence, and treatment-emergent serious adverse events.

SECTION

Statistical analysis and sample size

PARAGRAPH

A total of 375 participants (2:1 randomisation) were planned for enrolment and evaluation as the intention-to-treat population.

With these participant numbers and under the assumption that the proportion achieving SVR12 would be 96% in both arms, the study had approximately 80% power to show non-inferiority of the simplified monitoring strategy compared to the standard monitoring strategy, with a lower confidence bound for SVR12 in the simplified monitoring arm greater than 90% or with a lower confidence bound for the difference (simplified arm minus standard arm) in SVR12 greater than −6%.

The 90% threshold for non-inferiority in the standard monitoring arm was based on the clinical trial data available at the time of study design (SVR12 96%), minus a 6% non-inferiority margin.9,16

The non-inferiority margin of 6% was selected in accordance with the principles outlined in guidance on conducting non-inferiority trials;17,18 the choice of margin ensured minimal to no loss of efficacy.

PARAGRAPH

Primary efficacy and safety data were analysed in the intention-to-treat population (all enrolled participants for efficacy and safety, as all received study drug), with loss to follow-up deemed treatment failure.

The modified intention-to-treat population included participants in the intention-to-treat population, but excluded those who did not attend follow-up at or after post-treatment week 12.

The per-protocol population included participants who completed the prescribed 8-week treatment course and attended follow-up after treatment.

SVR12 assessment was nominally set at post-treatment day 84, with a lower limit of post-treatment day 70.

The upper limit was not specified and was set to study close.

PARAGRAPH

Categorical parameters were summarised as number and proportion.

Continuous variables were summarised as either mean (SD) or median (IQR), as appropriate.

For all efficacy endpoints, means and proportions with 2-sided 95% CIs were determined.

Adherence was measured by a self-reported adherence questionnaire (on-treatment week 4 and 8) at phone contact visits, and by pill count at post-treatment week 12.

On-treatment adherence was calculated by subtracting the number of missed doses from the total number of doses prescribed for therapy duration and dividing by the total number of doses prescribed for therapy duration.

By pill count and self-reported questionnaire, glecaprevir-pibrentasvir adherence was individually calculated at the 90/90 and 95/95 levels, defined as receipt of ≥90% or ≥95% of scheduled doses for ≥90% or ≥95% of the scheduled treatment period, respectively.

In calculating adherence, pill count took precedence over self-report if discrepancies were noted.

A participant was considered adherent if that individual received ≥95% of scheduled doses for ≥95% of the scheduled treatment period.

Analysis was performed using STATA (version 15.0; StataCorp, College Station, TX).

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

Of 433 participants screened between 21 August 2017 to 16 July 2018, 380 were enrolled and randomised into the simplified (n = 253) and standard (n = 127) arms (Fig. 2).

Of the 53 participants excluded at screening, 43 (81%) did not meet eligibility criteria, most commonly due to HCV RNA <10,000 IU/ml (n = 18), and positive urinary drug screen (n = 10) (Table S2).

PARAGRAPH

The demographic and clinical characteristics of enrolled participants were similar between the arms (Table 1).

Overall, median age was 51 years, and 39% were female.

The genotype distribution included 47% (n = 179) genotype 1 (1a 33%, n = 124; 1b 13%, n = 51; 1 no subtype 1%, n = 4); 14% (n = 52) genotype 2; 32% (n = 121) genotype 3; 5% (n = 18) genotype 4; <1% (n = 1) genotype 5; 2% (n = 8) genotype 6.

One participant had an indeterminate genotype.

Median baseline HCV RNA was 6.3 log10 IU/ml (IQR 5.4–7.0), with baseline HCV RNA >1,000,000 IU/ml (>6 log10) in 59% (n = 101) and >10,000,000 IU/ml (>7 log10) in 22% (n = 83).

HIV coinfection was documented in 7% (n = 27), with median CD4 count 698 cells x 106/L and HIV viral load below 50 copies/ml in 89% (n = 24; 3 participants had missing results at screening).

All participants with HIV were receiving antiretroviral therapy (n = 27) (Table S5).

PARAGRAPH

Among all participants enrolled, the prevalence of polymorphisms in NS3 and NS5A was 19% and 16%, respectively, and was seen with similar frequency in the simplified and standard arms (Table S6).

The most common NS5A polymorphisms were at positions 28 and 30.

The prevalence of the Y93H/N variant was 3% in the simplified arm and 3% in the standard arm (Table S6).

Among participants with HCV genotype 3, the prevalence of the A30K variant was 2% (5/253) in the simplified arm and 1% (1/127) in the standard arm.

PARAGRAPH

Among all participants enrolled, 99% (simplified arm 98%; standard arm 100%) completed their treatment course.

Of the 4 participants in the simplified arm who did not complete treatment, 2 discontinued treatment (both within week 1), 1 due to an adverse event and 1 unwilling to continue, and 2 were lost to follow-up on-treatment (Table 2).

Overall, 96% of participants were ≥95% adherent to the prescribed treatment course (simplified arm 95%; standard arm 98%; difference between arms −3.2%, 95% CI −6.6%–0.2%) (Table 2).

PARAGRAPH

In the intention-to-treat population (n = 380), SVR12 was 92% (233/253; 95% CI 88%–95%) in the simplified arm and 95% (121/127; 95% CI 90%–98%) in the standard arm (difference between arms −3.2%, 95% CI −8.2% to 1.8%) (Table 3, Fig. 3).

Thus, non-inferiority of the simplified arm to the standard arm was not shown, with the 95% lower confidence bound for the difference in SVR12 rates falling below −6% (−8.2%).

PARAGRAPH

In the modified intention-to-treat population (n = 364), which excluded participants who died (n = 1), were lost to follow-up (n = 14), or had missing HCV RNA results (n = 1; unable to perform phlebotomy due to difficult venous access), SVR12 was 97% (233/241; 95% CI 94%–99%) in the simplified arm and 98% (121/123; 95% CI 94%–100%) in the standard arm (difference between arms −1.7%; 95% CI −4.9% to 1.5%) (Table 3).

PARAGRAPH

In the per-protocol population (n = 362), excluding participants who died (n = 1), discontinued treatment (n = 2), were lost to follow-up (n = 14) or had missing HCV RNA results (n = 1), SVR12 was 97% (233/239; 95% CI 95%–99%) in the simplified arm and 98% (121/123; 95% CI 94%–100%) in the standard arm (difference between arms −0.9%; 95% CI −3.9% to 2.1%) (Table 3).

PARAGRAPH

The proportion with SVR12 (including 95% CI) stratified by key characteristics is shown in the supplementary information (Table S8A,B).

In the intention-to-treat population, SVR12 was higher among participants with genotype 1 (96%) compared to those with non-genotype 1 infection (91%; p = 0.03; Fig. 3); SVR was 91% among participants with genotype 3.

In the per-protocol population, SVR12 was similar among participants with genotype 1 (99%) compared to those with non-genotype 1 infection (97%; p = 0.12); SVR12 was 97% among participants with genotype 3.

In the intention-to-treat population, SVR12 was higher among participants who were ≥95% adherent to therapy (345/366, 94%) compared to those <95% adherent to therapy (9/14, 64%; p <0.001).

Of the 5 non-adherent participants without an SVR12, 2 were early treatment discontinuations and 3 were lost to follow-up.

PARAGRAPH

Overall, 26 participants did not achieve SVR12 (simplified arm, 20/253; standard arm, 6/127; Table 3), with the majority related to loss to follow-up.

There were 8 cases of virological failure, including 6 (2.4%) in the simplified arm and 2 (1.6%) in the standard arm (Table 3).

All participants with virological failure were ≥95% adherent to treatment.

Further details on participants with virologic failure are provided (Table S9A,B).

PARAGRAPH

There were 14 participants lost to follow-up, 4 (3%) in the standard arm and 10 (4%) in the simplified arm.

No baseline factors were significantly associated with loss to follow-up, although the rate was higher among those aged less than 50 years (6%) compared to older participants (2%) (Table S10).

Of note, among study participants lost to follow-up (n = 14) or without SVR12 assessment (n = 1), adherence reporting was available in 13 participants and was reported as above 95% in all.

PARAGRAPH

Of the 380 participants enrolled, 1 participant (<1%) discontinued treatment prematurely because of an adverse event (simplified arm 1/253; standard arm 0/127) (Table 4).

Overall, 53% of participants experienced at least 1 adverse event (simplified arm 133/253; standard arm 70/127), of which the majority were of mild to moderate severity (Table 4).

The most common adverse events were fatigue, headache and nausea, with similar rates in the simplified and standard arms (Table 4).

Three participants (simplified arm 3/253; standard arm 0/127) experienced a treatment-emergent serious adverse event; none was deemed related to treatment (Table S12).

One participant died after post-treatment week 4 due to lung adenocarcinoma.

PARAGRAPH

Adverse event reporting was similar across arms, despite the additional clinic-based contact in the standard arm.

Among all treatment-emergent adverse events reported in the simplified arm (n = 294), most were reported by phone at week 4 (64%, n = 188) or week 8 (20%, n = 60).

Among all treatment-emergent adverse events reported in the standard arm (n = 192), most were reported by phone at week 4 (59%, n = 114) or week 8 (17%, n = 33); a minority were reported at scheduled clinic visits at week 4 (13%, n = 25) or week 8 (5%, n = 9).

PARAGRAPH

Participants underwent unscheduled reviews during the study (in addition to protocol mandated clinic visits or phone contact) with similar frequency in the simplified arm (8%; 20/253) and the standard arm (6%; 8/127) (p = 0.68), of which only a small number presented for additional review on-treatment (simplified arm 4%, 11/253; standard arm 2%, 3/127; Table S15).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Among treatment-naïve patients with chronic HCV infection without cirrhosis, the efficacy of glecaprevir-pibrentasvir for 8 weeks with a simplified treatment monitoring schedule did not achieve non-inferiority compared to a standard treatment monitoring schedule.

In the intention-to-treat population, the SVR was 92% in the simplified arm and 95% in the standard arm.

The lower SVR in the simplified arm did not relate to virological failure (simplified arm 2.4%; standard arm 1.6%).

A higher proportion with non-virological failure in the simplified arm (5.5%) compared with the standard arm (3.1%) contributed to the difference in efficacy, including early treatment discontinuations in 2 participants, 1 death, and a marginally higher loss to follow-up (4.3% vs. 3.1%).

Safety was comparable across both arms.

These findings suggest that for many patients, particularly those without cirrhosis or adherence concerns, a simplified treatment monitoring schedule may be appropriate.

Equally, the findings highlight the need for careful selection of patients for simplified treatment monitoring and the need to optimise post-treatment follow-up.

PARAGRAPH

A per-protocol SVR of 97%–98% across the study arms is consistent with the high efficacy of 8-week glecaprevir-pibrentasvir demonstrated in phase III clinical trials (95%–99%).9

The lower intention-to-treat SVR in SMART-C (92%–95%) is attributed to a higher loss to follow-up, with recruitment into this investigator-initiated trial through a large network of tertiary and primary care sites.

The majority of those lost to follow-up after treatment (n = 14) had reported high adherence during treatment, and thus may have been cured.

There were no baseline factors associated with loss to follow-up, although the power to detect such associations was limited by the small sub-population.

PARAGRAPH

A lack of non-inferiority in SVR between simplified and standard arms was observed, with a difference in efficacy of −3.2% (95% CI −8.2%–1.8%).

The study sample was determined, based on an expected SVR of 96% and a non-inferiority margin of 6%.

This primary endpoint difference in intention-to-treat efficacy may reflect a true decrement in treatment outcome due to the simplified monitoring approach, or alternatively be a limitation of the study power (sample size provided 80% power to determine non-inferiority).

PARAGRAPH

A simplified on-treatment monitoring schedule, with nurse phone contact at week 4 and week 8 (end of treatment) and no face-to-face clinic visits or laboratory assessments, was safe and associated with high treatment adherence.

Adverse event and adherence reporting were standardised across the randomised arms, with all study participants reporting via study nurse phone calls at week 4 and 8.

Based on this reporting, adverse events were comparable across the study arms, in terms of overall adverse event occurrence (simplified arm 53%; standard arm 55%), pattern of adverse events, and serious adverse events (simplified arm 1%; standard arm 0%).

PARAGRAPH

Adherence to glecaprevir-pibrentasvir (taken as 3 co-formulated pills once daily) was high in both arms (≥95% adherent to prescribed treatment course; simplified arm 95%; standard arm 98%).

The absence of a week 4 clinical visit and virological assessment in the simplified arm had limited impact on treatment adherence.

The proportion of participants missing at least 1 dose by week 4 was higher in the simplified (10%) compared to standard (3%) arm, although this measure was similar by week 8 (12% vs. 11%).

Furthermore, the SVR in those missing at least 1 dose by week 4 in the simplified arm was high (100%), consistent with most of these participants missing only 1 dose.

The potency and predictability of DAA therapy means the vast majority of patients have either undetectable or very low-level HCV RNA at week 4.

Early virological assessment has therefore been considered more important for monitoring of treatment adherence.

PARAGRAPH

The eligibility criteria for SMART-C highlight the need for careful clinical assessment, including discussion of adherence support needs, prior to recommending a simplified monitoring schedule.

For example, people who reported injecting drug use within 6 months of screening were not eligible for enrolment due to their generally enhanced support needs.

We have undertaken clinical trials of DAA therapy among people who inject drugs, that have demonstrated high adherence and efficacy, but these trials have incorporated weekly clinic visits during treatment.19

Adherence rates decline with increasing treatment complexity, longer duration of therapy, and more than daily dosing,20–25 highlighting the importance of simple HCV treatment strategies to optimise adherence and outcomes.

PARAGRAPH

Some HCV treatment guidelines have already incorporated optional on-treatment virological monitoring.

The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) recommends that among patients receiving DAA therapy, HCV RNA (or HCV core antigen) and alanine aminotransferase should be measured at baseline and at post-treatment week 12 (or 24) to assess treatment efficacy (level of evidence: A1) and safety (level of evidence: B1), respectively.26

Indeed, the current EASL recommendations push the boundary further and suggest that “given the high SVR12 rates expected with these regimens across all groups of patients if adherent, checking SVR12 12 weeks after the end of treatment is dispensable (level of evidence: B1/B2)”.26

The American Association for the Study for the Liver guidelines remain more conservative, recommending on-treatment laboratory assessments of efficacy (HCV RNA) and safety (liver and renal function; level of evidence: B1).27

PARAGRAPH

The lack of non-inferiority in the SMART-C study indicates that caution should be exercised in relation to the EASL guidelines regarding simplified on-treatment monitoring.

The possibility remains that some patients, even within the restricted eligibility of the SMART-C study, may have benefited from standard on-treatment monitoring.

We also believe that documentation of SVR12 remains an important component of HCV therapeutic management, despite a low virological failure rate.

The SMART-C study incorporated a nurse phone contact at week 4 and 8 (end of treatment).

This contact may have assisted treatment adherence and post-treatment follow-up, therefore our findings should not be extrapolated to situations without this form of patient contact.

PARAGRAPH

The SMART-C study has some limitations that should be considered.

First, although the protocol excluded patients whom the clinician judged to have treatment adherence concerns, a standardised adherence assessment tool was not incorporated within the study.

Second, the study population was restricted to patients who were HCV treatment naïve, without cirrhosis, and recruited in high-income countries, largely through tertiary clinics.

Further studies of simplified monitoring are required in different settings and populations.

Importantly, the MINMON (clinicaltrials.gov; NCT03512210) single-arm trial is evaluating a simplified monitoring schedule for sofosbuvir-velpatasvir in the United States and several low- and middle-income countries.

Finally, a cost-effectiveness evaluation has not been undertaken to date.

Clinical care cost reductions through a simplified monitoring schedule could be offset if the SVR is reduced, even by a small margin.

PARAGRAPH

Additional aspects of simplified monitoring that could be evaluated, are the need for phone contact on-treatment, and mechanisms to enhance post-treatment follow-up, including self-collection and posting of samples (such as dried blood spots) for SVR12 assessment.

A key aspect of simplified monitoring trials is provision of the full course of therapy at treatment initiation, 8 weeks therapy with glecaprevir-pibrentasvir for SMART-C and 12 weeks therapy with sofosbuvir-velpatasvir for MINMON.

Incorporation of this simplified aspect may require regulatory changes in relation to pharmacy dispensing in different countries.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, the SMART-C study has demonstrated high adherence, high tolerability, and high treatment efficacy with an 8-week regimen of glecaprevir-pibrentasvir in patients with chronic HCV who are treatment naïve and without cirrhosis.

Although the comparison of simplified to standard treatment monitoring did not achieve non-inferiority, we believe that simplified monitoring can be recommended for many patients with chronic HCV, following careful individualised clinical assessment, including adherence support needs.

Progress towards achieving the WHO HCV elimination 2030 goals should be enhanced through greater simplification of DAA treatment and monitoring.
