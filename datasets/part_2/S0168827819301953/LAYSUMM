TITLE

Dynamics and predicted drug response of a gene network linking dedifferentiation with beta-catenin dysfunction in hepatocellular carcinoma

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a heterogeneous disease driven by the concomitant deregulation of several genes functionally organized as networks.

Here, we identified a gene regulatory network involved in a subset of HCCs.

This subset is characterized by increased proliferation and poor prognosis.

We developed a mathematical model which uncovers the dynamics of the network and allows us to predict the impact of a therapeutic agent, not only on its specific target but on all the genes belonging to the network.
