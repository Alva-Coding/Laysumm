ABSTRACT

TITLE

Development of a simple score based on HBeAg and ALT for selecting patients for HBV treatment in Africa

PARAGRAPH

To eliminate hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, it is essential to scale up antiviral treatment through decentralized services.

However, access to the conventional tools to assess treatment eligibility (liver biopsy/Fibroscan®/HBV DNA) is limited and not affordable in resource-limited countries.

We developed and validated a simple score to easily identify patients in need of HBV treatment in Africa.

PARAGRAPH

As a reference, we used treatment eligibility determined by the European Association for the Study of the Liver based on alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver histology and/or Fibroscan and HBV DNA.

We derived a score indicating treatment eligibility by a stepwise logistic regression using a cohort of chronic HBV infection in The Gambia (n = 804).

We subsequently validated the score in an external cohort of HBV-infected Africans from Senegal, Burkina Faso, and Europe (n = 327).

PARAGRAPH

Out of several parameters, two remained in the final model, namely HBV e antigen (HBeAg) and ALT level, constituting a simple score (treatment eligibility in Africa for the hepatitis B virus: TREAT-B).

The score demonstrated a high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.85, 95% CI 0.79–0.91) in the validation set.

The score of 2 and above (HBeAg-positive and ALT ≥20 U/L or HBeAg-negative and ALT ≥40 U/L) had a sensitivity and specificity for treatment eligibility of 85% and 77%, respectively.

The sensitivity and specificity of the World Health Organization criteria based on the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and ALT were 90% and 40%, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

A simple score based on HBeAg and ALT had a high diagnostic accuracy for the selection of patients for HBV treatment.

This score could be useful in African settings.
