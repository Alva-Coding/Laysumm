TITLE

Liver transplantation in patients with multiple organ failures: Feasibility and outcomes

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Patients with advanced liver disease may develop one or more organ failures (OFs) when acute decompensation occurs.

Acute decompensation is often precipitated by hepatic or extra-hepatic insults such as infections, gastrointestinal bleeding, reactivation of viral hepatitis or alcohol abuse.1–7

Recently there has been a renewed interest in the impact of OFs on short-term mortality of patients with chronic liver diseases.1–4,8–10

It has been suggested that those who develop OF after acute decompensation may have a different pathophysiology and prognosis compared to those who decompensate without the development of OF.

The term acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) has been used recently to describe this entity.

Although studies from Asia, Europe and North America have used different definitions to describe OF, and hence ACLF, these studies have consistently shown that patients with multiple OF have poor short-term outcomes, irrespective of the precipitating cause of decompensation.1–4,11–13

These studies, based on relatively small sample sizes, also showed that mortality increased with increasing number of OFs, with 30-day mortality reaching well over 80% in those with 3–4 OFs.

Patients with cirrhosis who experience an acute decompensating event and develop one or more OFs utilize enormous resources since they are managed in the intensive care units, often requiring dialysis and ventilatory support, while awaiting spontaneous recovery or liver transplantation (LT).

There are, however, only limited data on the effectiveness or futility of LT in the setting of patients with multiple OF.11–21

PARAGRAPH

We believe that a significant proportion of patients who receive LT within 30-days of listing for LT may have multiple OF, and many of them may indeed have ACLF.

The role and outcomes of LT in patients with multiple OF are not very well defined in the literature.

Additionally, it is not known whether the type of OF influences the graft and patient survival.

To explore the impact of type and number of OFs on LT outcomes, we decided to retrospectively examine a cohort of patients listed for LT with the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) from 2002 to 2016, who were transplanted within 30 days of listing.

SECTION

Patients and methods

PARAGRAPH

All adult patients listed for LT with the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) between February 27, 2002 and September 30, 2016 were included in the study (Fig. 1).

We excluded patients who were younger than 18 years old, those listed for multiple organ transplantation, and those listed as status 1A (this high priority status is designated for those who develop acute or fulminant liver failure, without pre-existing cirrhosis, with a life expectancy of a few days without an LT).

The starting date was limited to February 27, 2002 since the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score-based system for organ allocation was introduced on that date.

PARAGRAPH

Of the patients listed for LT, 4,714 (4.1%) died and 19,375 (16.6%) received an LT within 30-days, and the remaining 92,493 (79.3%) were still on a waiting list at the end of 30-days.

Among these patients, we determined the prevalence of OF using a modified version of the CLIF-SOFA scale.2

The OF types included were: i) cerebral failure defined as encephalopathy 3–4 grade, ii) coagulation failure defined as international normalized ratio (INR) ≥2.5, iii) liver failure defined as bilirubin ≥12.0, iv) renal failure defined as creatinine ≥2.0; v) respiratory failure defined as being on mechanical ventilation and vi) circulatory failure defined as being on life support (use of vasopressors).

The only difference between CLIF-SOFA scale and our definition of OF was that the CLIF-SOFA defined respiratory failure as PaO2/FiO2 of ≤200 or SpO2/FiO2 of ≤214 or being on a ventilator.

Since we did not have information on PaO2/FiO2 or SpO2/FiO2, we defined respiratory failure as being on a ventilator.

We determined the number of OFs based on this definition at the time of LT and grouped them as shown (Fig. 2); we combined those with five or six OFs into one group because of the relatively small sample size in those groups.

The distribution of OFs at the time of listing is provided in the supplementary information (Fig. S1), and at the time of LT is shown (Fig. 2).

PARAGRAPH

For this study, we focused on patients who were transplanted within 30 days of listing.

We estimated the incidence of LT and their survival probability during the first year after receiving a transplant.

Considering that a recent study suggested that most patients removed for ‘other’ reasons were in fact removed due to clinical deterioration, we combined those who were removed from the list within 30 days of listing with the group that experienced death to reduce the bias in the estimates of the incidence rates of waitlist mortality.22

We examined immediate, one-year and long-term post-LT survival in those who received LT within 30 days of listing after stratifying them by the number and type of OF.

SECTION

Statistical methods

PARAGRAPH

The baseline characteristics of patients who were transplanted within 30 days of listing and those who are alive and waiting for a transplant at the end of 30 days were compared using Student’s t tests for continuous variables or Chi-squared tests for categorical variables.

We used Kaplan-Meier curves to estimate a probability of removal from the waitlist because of death or transplantation.

The cumulative incidences of the two competing events, the waiting list mortality and LT, were estimated using a cumulative incidence competing risk approach.23–25

We adjusted the cumulative incidences for the differences in patient characteristics and disease severity by estimating cause-specific cumulative incidence functions using a Fine and Gray model,23 to account for competing risk outcomes.

PARAGRAPH

For the population that received LT within the first 30 days, we estimated post-LT survival probability using a Kaplan-Meier approach, and the differences were assessed by log-rank test.

The strength of association between graft and patient mortality within one-year and the risk factors were analyzed via estimating hazard rate ratios.

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

After excluding patients with missing date of listing (n = 1,122), patients <18 years old, those listed for multiple organ transplantation (n = 11,417), and status 1 or 1A (n = 3,879), 116,582 patients were included in the analysis (Fig. 1).

Of these 4,714 (4.1%) died within 30-days of listing and 19,375 (16.6%) were transplanted within 30 days of listing; the remaining 92,493 (79.3%) remained on the waiting list after 30 days.

SECTION

Clinical characteristics at the time of listing

PARAGRAPH

The clinical characteristics of patients at the time of listing stratified by those who died within 30 days, those who had LT within 30 days and those who were alive after 30 days without LT are shown (Table 1).

There were significant differences between the three groups.

Women or Hispanics were more likely to die and less likely to receive LT within 30 days; Blacks were more likely to die and more likely to receive LT. Mean MELD scores (±SD) were 29.8 (±10.5), 25.3 (±10.4) and 13.9 (±5.4) in those who died, transplanted and alive without transplantation respectively; the proportion of patients with MELD scores 35 or above were 35.5%, 21% and 0.4%, respectively, for the three groups.

Patients who died within 30 days had higher MELD scores and had more OFs than those who were transplanted within 30 days.

PARAGRAPH

One or more OFs were more common at the time of listing in those who died (74.4%) or were transplanted (57.4%) compared to those who were alive without LT (9.5%).

The most common OFs were renal (n = 2,021), liver (n = 2,240), and coagulopathy (n = 1,676) followed by stage 3–4 hepatic encephalopathy (n = 1,067), circulatory failure (n = 784) and respiratory failure (n = 703).

Based on the number of OFs, patients were stratified into six groups; those with five and six OFs were combined because of relatively small sample sizes.

The frequency of OF in the three groups is shown (Table 1), and the distribution of the type of OF in different groups at time of listing is shown (Fig. S1).

While respiratory and circulatory failure were uncommon in those with 1–3 OFs, it was very common in those with 4–6 (Fig. S1).

While three or more OFs were present in 29.8%, 13.2% and 0.3% in the groups that died, transplanted or alive respectively, four or more OFs were present in 16%, 4.6% and 0.1%, respectively.

SECTION

Clinical characteristics at the time of liver transplantation

PARAGRAPH

There was worsening of clinical characteristics between listing and LT. Among those who received LT within 30 days, there were 2,515 patients with three or more OFs at listing, there were 3,556 patients with three or more OFs at the time of LT. Five or six OFs were present in 333 patients at listing and 677 patients at the time of LT. A comparative analysis of clinical characteristics and the time of listing and LT is shown (Table 2).

Because of these significant differences, we analyzed the LT outcomes based on the number of OFs at listing and also at the time of LT.

SECTION

Removal from waitlist due to death or liver transplantation

PARAGRAPH

The probability of waitlist removal due to death or transplantation within 30 days of listing for LT increased with increasing number of OFs; while only 10% were removed from the waitlist due to death or LT at 30 days in those without OF, 80% were removed when there were two OFs, and 92–98% were removed when there were three or more OFs.

Only 20% remained on the list at 10 days and only 2% remained on the list at 30 days in the presence of 5–6 OFs; the corresponding proportion at 10 and 30 days in the absence of OF was 96% and 90%, respectively (Fig. 3A, Table S1).

PARAGRAPH

The cumulative incidence of LT stratified by the number and type of OFs is shown (Fig. 3B and 3C).

Patients with two or more OFs had a higher incidence of LT (Fig. 3B).

The median time to LT was 156 days in the absence of OF, 26 days with one OF, eight days with two OFs, five days with 3–4 OFs, and four days with 5–6 OFs (Table S1).

The median time to death (in patients not receiving LT) was 439 days in the absence of OF, 76 days with one OF, 15 days with two OFs, 10 days with three OFs, 7 days with four OFs, and 6 days with 5–6 OFs.

The type of OF also had an impact on median time to LT – 15 days with cerebral failure, 8 days with renal or coagulation failure, 9 days with liver failure and 6 days with circulatory or respiratory failure (Table S1).

PARAGRAPH

The mean MELD score of patients with three or more OFs was 39–40 (median 40–42, 40 being the MELD cut-off) and 34 with two OFs suggesting that the MELD score did not discriminate these groups very well (Fig. 3B, 3C, Table S2).

SECTION

Post-LT graft and patient survival based on the number of OFs

PARAGRAPH

One-year post-LT patient survival, in those who received LT within 30 days of listing, by the number of OFs at LT is shown (Fig. 4A); graft survival is shown (Fig. S2).

There was a decline in 90-day and one-year graft and patient survival for those with higher numbers of OFs, but the maximum difference in survival between those with no OF and 5–6 OFs was 9% for graft and patient at 12 months based on OF at LT (Table 3).

When the same analysis was performed based on OF at the time of listing, there was a 10% difference in graft and 9% difference in patient survival between those with no OF and those with 5–6 OFs at one year (Table 3, Table S1 and S3).

PARAGRAPH

The primary graft non-function (PGNF) was seen in 532 patients (2.75%), and there were no differences in PGNF between the groups (3.2% in those with no OF, and 2.7% in those with 5–6 OFs) (Table S3).

PARAGRAPH

We also examined whether there were differences in patient survival during the study period (2002–2016).

When we compared patient survival in those who were transplanted between 2002 and 2009 with those transplanted between 2010 and 2016 based on the number of OFs at the time of listing, there was 4–7% improvement in survival in those who were transplanted between 2010 to 2016.

These differences, however, were not statistically significant (Table S4).

However, there was 8–11% improvement (statistically significant p <0.05) in one-year patient survival for those with three OFs or more when analyzed by the number of OFs at the time of LT in those transplanted during 2010-2016.

PARAGRAPH

When we followed the LT recipients for five years, patient survival differences between the groups more or less remained unchanged with 67–74% surviving five years or more (Table 3).

SECTION

Post-LT graft and patient survival based on the type of OF

PARAGRAPH

When survival was stratified by the type of OF, there was a lower survival in those with circulatory or ventilatory failure (one-year patient survival 79–81% vs. 84–87%) when compared to other types of OF (Fig. 4B, Table S5).

The reduced survival in those with circulatory or ventilatory failure could be a reflection of multiple OF in these patients.

PARAGRAPH

There were 625 patients who were on dialysis, life support and respiratory failure (three non-hepatic OFs) at the time of LT (282 at the time of listing).

We examined the graft (Fig. S5) and patient survival (Fig. 4C) in that group (n = 625) and compared them to others (n = 18,699).

The graft survival was 74% and patient survival was 77% in those with three non-hepatic OFs; the graft and patient survival were 86% and 88% respectively for others.

SECTION

Independent predictors of graft and patient survival

PARAGRAPH

Independent negative predictors (on multivariate analysis) of graft survival were age, hepatitis C infection, donor risk index (DRI) and the number of OFs; Asians (0.69; 95% CI 0.54–0.88; p <0.01) had relatively better graft survival when compared to the White population (Table 4).

Independent negative predictors (on multivariate analysis) of patient survival were age, hepatitis C infection or hepatocellular carcinoma, DRI and the number of OFs; both Asians and Hispanics had relatively better patient survival when compared to the White population (Table 5).

The hazard ratio (HR) increased steadily from 1.32 with one OF to 2.73 with 5–6 OFs (Table 5).

The MELD score was not an independent predictor of either graft or patient survival.

PARAGRAPH

We also analyzed data based on OF at the time of listing, and these results are shown (Tables S6 and S7).

The independent impact of OF on survival was more obvious when analysis was based on OF at LT. These differences could be a reflection of the differences in the sample size.

PARAGRAPH

To identify variables that could potentially predict futility of LT in the presence of three or more OFs, we examined the differences in patient characteristics in those who died or survived one-year or more after LT (Table S8).

Of the 3,556 patients who were transplanted with three OFs or more, 581 died within one-year after LT and 2,975 survived one-year or more.

Although there were many differences between those who died within one-year or survived one-year or more after LT by univariate analysis (Table S8), on multivariate analysis, age (HR 1.024, p <0.0001) and being on a ventilator (HR 1.7, p <0.001) were the only two negative predictors of survival.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this study we have shown that 92–98% of patients were removed, either due to death or LT, from the waitlist within 30 days of listing if they had three or more OFs and 80% were removed in the presence of two OFs.

In contrast, only 10% were removed in the absence of OF.

Patients with three or more OFs had only a small window (median time to death 6–10 days) to receive LT after listing.

Despite multiple OF, if patients received LT expeditiously (median time to LT was 4–5 days in the presence of three or more OFs), they had excellent post-LT one-year survival ranging from 81% with 5–6 OFs to 84 with three OFs.

The increasing number of OFs at the time of transplantation had a small negative impact on survival.

Considering that patients with 5–6 OFs had 98% probability of waitlist removal either due to death or LT, these differences in post-LT survival are clinically irrelevant as almost all of them would have died within 30 days of listing without an LT. We also did not find an increase in PGNF in those with more OFs.

PARAGRAPH

It is difficult to compare our study with ACLF studies for many reasons including the retrospective nature of the data analysis and the lack of granularity on data collection.

The definition of OFs we used in this study is similar to the CLIF-SOFA scale except for respiratory failure.2,8–13

It is possible that mechanical ventilation was used in some patients for airway protection and vasopressors were used in some patients to maintain them on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis, and therefore we may have overestimated both respiratory and circulatory failure in this cohort.

In this study, we are assuming that many of these patients may have had ACLF based on OF, however it is pertinent to note that the definition of ACLF is also mostly based on the presence of OF and very high 28-day mortality in the background of an acute decompensating event and not based on any measurable factors or precisely definable event.1–3,8–13

In ACLF studies, 28-day mortality data were assessed based on the interval between hospitalization and death whereas we estimated 30-day waitlist mortality from the time of listing to death or LT by competing risk analysis.

It is more than likely that many patients with ACLF were not listed for LT due to a variety of reasons including age, ongoing infections, cardiac diseases and other major co-morbid illnesses including cancer, or perhaps on the assumption that they were too ill to survive LT. There could also be a significant delay in listing for logistical reasons or because of indecisiveness about the utility or futility of LT in such a situation.

Additionally, there also may be center specific differences in listing for LT in the presence of multiple OF.

These factors introduce a dimension of selection bias in our study although one could argue that it is equally applicable to ACLF studies published to date.

Despite all these limitations, we feel that our data are compelling to suggest that patients with multiple OF do well if they received LT in a timely manner and moreover, they would have had a dismal prognosis without LT.

PARAGRAPH

The cumulative incidence of LT within 30 days of listing in the presence of two or more OFs ranged from 48 to 66%, but the type of OF did not significantly impact the incidence of LT except for marginally lower incidence rate with cerebral failure (40% vs. 46–56%).

The higher LT incidence rates for coagulation, renal and liver failure were to be expected as these are components (INR, serum creatinine and bilirubin) of the MELD score that were used to prioritize organ allocation.

We have shown that post-LT graft and patient survival rates were excellent despite multiple OF; only 4–6% patients died within 30 days and 9–11% died within 90 days when they were transplanted in the presence of three or more OFs with mean MELD scores of 39 to 40.

In this large cohort of patients, one-year patient survival was 81% in those who had 5–6 OFs, 84% with three OFs and 90% in those without OF.

In multivariate analysis, the HR increased steadily with increasing number of OFs.

When the type of OF was assessed, only respiratory failure was associated with a lower one-year survival.

Nevertheless, the one-year survival difference between those who had no OF and those with 5–6 OFs was only 9%.

When we analyzed the group with three OFs that included dialysis, circulatory and ventilatory failure, the patient survival was still 77% at one year.

The excellent short and long-term survival in these very sick patients underscores the remarkable progress that we have made in the surgical field of LT.

PARAGRAPH

When we divided the cohort into two groups based on the year of LT (2002–2009 and 2010–2016), one-year patient survival was 8–11% better in those with three OFs or more in those who were transplanted during 2010–2016.

Improvement in surgical techniques alone will not explain this improvement.

A number of factors including increased number of patients with alcoholic liver diseases, improvement in HCV treatment, MELD-35 share and a better overall management of immunosuppression and infections may explain the better survival in those who were transplanted between 2010–2016.

PARAGRAPH

In this cohort of patients with OF, the median time to death, if they were not to receive a suitable organ, was only 6–7 days with four or more OFs and 10 days with three OFs.

When patients with three or more OFs received an LT, it happened within a median interval of 4–5 days after listing.

These observations suggest that the window for LT is very small and if they did not receive an organ within a week, the majority of patients with three or more OFs died.

On the basis of these findings, we suggest that LT organ allocation agencies may have to seriously consider prioritizing organ allocation based on the number of OFs (and not just MELD score alone since MELD scores were similar in groups with three or more OFs) to those who are admitted to the hospitals with multiple OF.

PARAGRAPH

There are only limited data on LT in patients with multiple OF.14

In one ACLF study from Europe, only 9% (37 of 415) of patients with ACLF were transplanted within 28 days, and in those with ACLF grade 2 or 3, post-LT survival was 80% and they received LT at a median interval of 11 days (1–28 days) from the time of diagnosis of ACLF; in contrast the survival was less than 20% in those who did not receive LT.2 In another single center retrospective study, 94 of 144 patients with ACLF were evaluated for LT, 71 were listed, 33 underwent LT and 38 died on the waiting list; in those who were transplanted, one-year survival was 87%.20

In that study, those who received renal replacement therapy or mechanical ventilation were less likely to undergo LT. Although we found that patients on mechanical ventilation had a higher mortality, they did relatively well if they received a timely LT, indicating that mechanical ventilation is not a contraindication for LT in the presence of multiple OF.

In another retrospective study of 73 patients, from three liver intensive care units, with three or more OFs transplanted after a median of nine days after hospitalization, the post-LT survival was 83.9%, but there were higher rates of complications and longer hospital stays when compared to matched control patients.14

The role of live donor LT in the presence of ACLF was examined in a retrospective manner recently in 190 patients (three or more OFs in 51 patients).

A one-year patient survival of 79.5% was found, suggesting that live donor LT could be considered in this situation.21

There was a statistically insignificant trend towards lower graft survival in those with three or more OFs when compared to those with one OF, and moreover, those with OF stayed longer in the intensive care unit when compared to those without OF, and these observations are similar to those with cadaver LT in this situation.

Based on our observations and the above studies, we feel that patients with multiple OF, irrespective of the number or type of OFs, should be offered LT, cadaver or live donor, if there are no other contraindications.

MELD scores alone will not permit us to prioritize these patients for expedited LT, and we need to develop suitable organ allocation models for patients with multiple OF.

PARAGRAPH

Since there is only a small window for LT in patients with multiple OF, we should explore treatment options to prolong survival while awaiting LT in those with multiple OF.

Extracorporeal liver assist systems such as molecular adsorbent recirculation system (MARS) or plasma separation and absorption system (Prometheus) have shown inconsistent results in prolonging life in those with ACLF.26–28

A recent, retrospective study has shown promising results with MARS in prolonging life in those with advanced ACLF, and if this could be replicated in prospective studies, we may further advance the management of these patients by enlarging the window for LT in these patients.27

Better studies, however, are necessary before we can define the role of liver support systems in patients with cirrhosis who present with multiple OF.

Other modalities such as treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or stem cell transplantation are only at exploratory phases, and cannot currently be recommended.29–31

PARAGRAPH

There are a few limitations with our study.

We did not perform center specific differences in post-LT outcomes in view of the overall excellent results after LT. The database also did not permit us to determine the cause of decompensating events, and this is perhaps not important for this study as previous studies characterized the causes from many parts of the world.1–7

The decompensating events vary in different parts of the world, but about 40% have no identifiable cause.

Based on North American studies, we assume that many of these patients with multiple OF may have had infection as the precipitating event that resulted in a cascade of events causing multiple OF.3

Although one may consider ongoing infection as a relative contraindication for LT, our study shows that these patients could be successfully transplanted with appropriate antibiotic coverage.

The UNOS database, however, does not have the granularity to identify the type of antibiotics, duration of treatment and interval between treatment and LT. Despite these limitations, our study has many strengths in addition to a large, unselected cohort of patients from all transplant centers in the USA.

We used hard endpoints including death/deterioration or LT. We had detailed information about patient characteristics, type and number of OFs at the time of listing and transplantation, interval between listing and transplantation, and donor characteristics in those who received LT.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, we have shown that among patients who died within 30-days of listing for LT, the number of OFs was an important predictor of short-term survival with 92–98% of patients removed from the waiting list because of death or LT in the presence of three or more OFs.

If these patients with three or more OFs received LT in a timely fashion, 80–85% survived one year and beyond.

Based on these data, we believe that patients with cirrhosis and multiple OF should be given priority for expedited LT. Our observations also suggest that the effects of a recent decompensation could be ameliorated by LT and transplant futility may not apply to these patients.
