TITLE

Interferon-inducible MX2 is a host restriction factor of hepatitis B virus replication

PARAGRAPH

This study shows that the protein MX2, which is induced by interferon-α, has important anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) effector functions.

MX2 can reduce the amount of covalently closed circular DNA, which is the form of DNA that HBV uses to maintain viral persistence within hepatocytes.

MX2 also reduces HBV RNA levels by downregulating synthesis of viral RNA.

MX2 likely represents a novel intrinsic HBV inhibitor that could have therapeutic potential, as well as being useful for improving our understanding of the complex biology of HBV and the antiviral mechanisms of interferon-α.
