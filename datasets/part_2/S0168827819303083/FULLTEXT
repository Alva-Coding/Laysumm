TITLE

Longitudinal neurometabolic changes in the hippocampus of a rat model of chronic hepatic encephalopathy

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Chronic hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complication of chronic liver disease (CLD) and is characterized by cognitive and motor deficits.1–3

While minimal and overt HE may affect 20–70% of patients with CLD, the diagnosis is difficult in its early stages.4,5

Tools enabling the detection of early neurometabolic changes in patients may allow for timely intervention, thereby minimizing the number of overt HE episodes and ensuing complications and costs.

PARAGRAPH

Neurological alterations in HE are accepted to be the result of declining liver function, leading to impaired detoxification of ammonium (NH4+) and other substances that reach the brain.3,6–11

Although the molecular mechanisms leading to HE remain unclear, NH4+ and glutamine (Gln) are a common thread in the complex and multifactorial model of HE pathogenesis.

They are accepted to contribute to the incompletely understood metabolic cascades underlying the neurological manifestations of HE.

PARAGRAPH

Gln synthesis in the central nervous system (CNS) is largely confined to astrocytes (glutamine synthetase activity12).

In liver dysfunction or portosystemic shunting, increased NH4+ delivery to the brain increases astrocytic Gln, raising intracellular osmotic pressure and leading to astrocyte swelling and cytotoxic brain oedema.13–16

In addition, increased astrocytic Gln can lead to the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and interfere with glutamatergic neurotransmission.17–19

The mechanisms of NH4+ neurotoxicity also implicate oxidative/nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, cell-signalling disruption, neuroinflammation and alterations in neuronal process growth.9,10,16,20–24

While all these mechanisms appear implicated in the pathogenesis of HE, the sequence of events remains unclear, owing largely to the lack of reliable longitudinal studies.

PARAGRAPH

In vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is widely used to investigate brain metabolism non-invasively, allowing for longitudinal follow-up of disease and response to treatment.

1H-MRS was among the first techniques to provide indirect evidence in vivo of osmoregulatory disturbances: an increase in the sum Gln + glutamate (Glu; Gln + Glu = Glx) concentration together with a decrease in brain osmolyte myo-inositol (Ins).16

These changes have since been thought to underlie the low grade cerebral oedema observed in chronic HE in humans.

Later, other magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques (i.e. diffusion weighted/tensor imaging, water mapping) further expanded our understanding of chronic HE by demonstrating the presence of low grade cerebral oedema.13,25–28

Although these studies were instrumental in demonstrating neurometabolic disturbances, their contribution was limited by comparatively low magnetic field strengths used and the ensuing limitation in the number of metabolites quantified (i.e. Glx, total creatine (tCr), total choline (tCho) and Ins5,28–31).

Therefore, present day availability of very high magnetic field strengths (≥7T) combined with spectra acquisition at very short echo times (<10 ms) offer unprecedented opportunities to further understand the longitudinal neurometabolic events of chronic HE in detail by expanding the number of brain metabolites detectable in vivo to about 18 both in animal models and humans.32–35

PARAGRAPH

The bile-duct ligation (BDL) rat model is accepted by ISHEN (International Society for Hepatic Encephalopathy and Nitrogen Metabolism) as a model of type C HE, namely HE associated with liver disease, portal hypertension and hyperammonemia.36

To date, the few studies in this model have used in vivo or ex vivo 1H-MRS combined with MRI or behavioural tests at late time points.

The main findings of these studies were that plasma NH4+ and brain Gln increased while other brain osmolytes decreased (Ins and tCho).

They also brought controversial data regarding fluctuations in lactate (Lac), Glu, N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and brain water content.26,37–39

Further studies are required to understand the significance of these findings and to comprehend the chronology of events leading to these metabolic perturbations, including early molecular and cellular brain changes which may offer insight into the primary mechanisms of HE.

PARAGRAPH

Thus, we aimed to use a multimodal and longitudinal approach to test the hypothesis that neurometabolic changes are detectable very early on in the course of CLD.

Using the advantages of high field spectroscopy, we would therefore be able to analyse the longitudinal changes in tissue osmoregulation, neurotransmission, oxidative stress and energy metabolism leading to the well-characterized end-stage events in the BDL rat model, bringing important insight into the chronology of events leading to HE.

We combined in vivo longitudinal 1H-MRS at very high magnetic field (9.4T) and short echo time (TE = 2.8 ms) in the hippocampus, with biochemical, histological analysis and behavioural studies.

The rationale was to identify an unprecedented number of brain metabolites involved in chronic HE at key time points and analyse their implications at the molecular and tissue levels during the course of chronic HE in an established animal model.

Materials and methods

SECTION

BDL rat model for CLD

PARAGRAPH

All experiments were approved by the Committee on Animal Experimentation for the Canton de Vaud, Switzerland (VD3022/VD2439).

Wistar male adult rats (n = 44, 150–175 g, Charles River Laboratories, L’Arbresle, France) were used: 26 rats underwent BDL while 18 rats were sham-operated.

Experiments were performed before BDL (week 0) and at post-operative weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8 using isoflurane anaesthesia.

Early changes were defined as changes happening between weeks 0–4, and late changes those happening beyond week 4.

The 4-week limit was based on 2 factors: i) animal half-life in this model and ii) time until animals showed minimal signs of disease and steady weight gain.

SECTION

Validation of the CLD-induced HE in BDL rats: biochemical and behavioural measurements

PARAGRAPH

The following liver parameters were quantified on Integra© or COBAS8000© analysers (Roche, Switzerland): plasma NH4+ (n = 17), total bilirubin (n = 18), alanine aminotransferase (ALT; n = 14) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT; n = 12).

PARAGRAPH

To test the presence of fine motor deficits (characteristic of chronic HE), locomotor activity was assessed in the open field test.

The following parameters were evaluated using video tracking system (Noldus Ethovision software 11.5): frequency of crosses, percent time spent, latency to enter each zone [s], distance moved [m] and velocity [cm/s].

These parameters were calculated for the entire 10 min of the open field test.

A total of 17 BDL and 7 sham-operated rats were observed at 4, 6 and 8 weeks post-operation.

SECTION

In vivo 1H-MRS

PARAGRAPH

In vivo 1H-MRS measurements were performed longitudinally on a horizontal actively shielded 9.4T magnet using the SPECIAL sequence (TE = 2.8 ms) in a volume of interest (VOI) of 2 × 2.8 × 2 mm3 positioned in hippocampus, a key region implicated in cognitive deficits (i.e. learning, memory) observed in chronic HE.3

A total of 18 brain metabolites were quantified using LCModel and water as internal reference.

1H-MRS was performed before BDL (week 0; n = 26) and at post-operative weeks 2 (n = 10), 4 (n = 26), 6 (n = 22) and 8 (n = 22).

Each animal served as its own control, compared to week 0.

Animals were sacrificed at post-operative weeks 4 (n = 4 for BDL rats and n = 4 for sham-operated rats) and 8 (n = 7 for BDL rats and n = 7 for sham-operated rats), after 1H-MRS, for histological measurements.

SECTION

Immunohistochemistry

PARAGRAPH

A mouse monoclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; MAB360 Merck Millipore) antibody was used to characterize astrocyte morphology and counterstained with DAPI (nucleus labelling, blue fluorescence, D1306, Thermofisher).

To monitor the suspected change in water and ion balance in the brain tissue of BDL rats, a rabbit polyclonal anti-aquaporin 4 (AQP4; AB3594 Merck Millipore) antibody was used.

Secondary antibodies were goat or rat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG labelled with Alexa Fluor® 488 (green; Thermo Fisher Scientific), Alexa Fluor® 555 (red; Life Technologies) or Alexa Fluor® 594 (red; Jackson ImmunoResearch Europe Ltd).

Sholl analysis of astrocytes is described in detail in the Supplementary information.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Results are presented as mean ± SD and % increase/decrease compared to week 0.

One-way ANOVA (Prism 5.03, Graphpad, La Jolla CA USA) with respect to each metabolite in the neurochemical profile followed by Bonferroni’s multi-comparisons post-test (weeks post-BDL, total of 10 comparisons) were used.

For behavioural tests and Sholl analysis of astrocytes, 2-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multi-comparisons post-test were used to compare BDL and sham-operated rats.

All tests were 2-tailed.

Pearson correlation analysis was performed on all longitudinally acquired data to test for correlations between brain metabolites, plasma values and behavioural tests.

Of note, correlations between brain metabolites and behavioural tests were not performed since the hippocampus is known for its role in cognition/memory rather than motor coordination.

Significance in all tests was attributed as follows: *p <0.05; **p <0.01; ***p <0.001; ****p <0.0001.

Results

SECTION

Validation of the CLD-induced HE in BDL rats by biochemical and behavioural measurements

PARAGRAPH

Plasma values were in normal ranges for all rats before BDL, while NH4+ and bilirubin (Fig. 1A) rose following BDL.

The Fig. S1 shows the weight of the BDL animals.

BDL rats travelled a shorter distance than sham-operated animals at week 4 post-BDL (−24%), and this distance continued to decrease, reaching −54% at week 8 (Fig. 1B).

There was no difference between BDL and sham rats for the following: time spent in the wall-zone, centre-zone and inter-zone, and latency to enter centre-zone (Fig. S2), suggesting animal anxiety was not a variable.

SECTION

BDL-induced increase in cerebral Gln and decrease in other osmolytes, antioxidants and neurotransmitters, measured by 1H-MRS

PARAGRAPH

The first metabolite to increase was Gln at week 2 (compared to week 0), reaching significance at week 4 (+47%) and showing a gradual increase towards +136% at week 8 (Figs. 2, 3, Table S1).

The NH4+-induced increase in Gln was followed by a decrease in several metabolites commonly accepted as CNS osmolytes and brain cell volume regulators (Ins, tCho, taurine (Tau), creatine (Cr), phosphocreatine (PCr))40–42 (Figs. 2, 3, Table S1).

Ins showed a significant decrease at week 6 (−15%) and reached −30% at week 8.

Similarly, tCho (glycerophosphocholine (GPC) + phosphocholine (PCho)) showed a progressive decline reaching a significant −26% decrease at week 8 (Figs. 2, 3, Table S1).

Tau showed a −9% decrease from week 0 to week 8 (Figs. 2, 3, Table S1).

Cr displayed an early and statistically significant decrease at week 2, reaching a −11% decrease from week 0 to week 8 (Figs. 2, 3, Table S1).

PARAGRAPH

Next, we computed the sum of the main cerebral organic osmolytes to evaluate the osmoregulatory response to the Gln-induced osmolar stress (Fig. 4).

The sum which included Gln appeared to be constant (Fig. 4B), while the same sum without Gln showed a rapid decrease as early as 2 weeks post-BDL, reaching statistical significance at 6 weeks and −16% at 8 weeks post-BDL (Fig. 4C).

However, the absolute increase in Gln was slightly higher than the decrease in other organic osmolytes (at 8 weeks post-BDL: Gln: +4.4 mmol/kgww vs sum of osmolytes: −3.8 mmol/kgww, Fig. 4D).

PARAGRAPH

Among neurotransmitters, only Glu showed a late significant decrease at week 6, reaching −11% at week 8, while aspartate (Asp) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) showed no significant changes (Fig. 3).

In addition, NAA, a neuronal marker,43 did not display any changes during the course of the study.

Lac, a metabolite involved in CNS energy metabolism, showed a tendency to increase at week 8, although this finding did not reach statistical significance (+10%).

PCr displayed no changes throughout the course of the study even though Cr showed a significant decrease (Fig. 3).

This decrease in Cr was associated with a significant decrease of tCr (−8%).

PARAGRAPH

Finally, looking at antioxidants, ascorbate (Asc) showed an early and statistically significant decrease at week 4 compared to week 0 (−12%) and reached −15% at week 8, while no significant changes were observed for glutathione (GSH), even though a slight decrease was noticed over the course of the study (Fig. 3).

SECTION

Astrocyte changes and dysregulation of AQP4 in BDL rats

PARAGRAPH

Using GFAP staining, we demonstrated that BDL rats, compared to sham-operated controls, developed time-dependent changes in astrocyte morphology, observable starting at 4 weeks post-BDL and increasing until 8 weeks post-BDL (Fig. 5A,B).

Astrocytes showed a thickening of their main proximal processes, as well as retraction (shortening of processes length measured on sections: week 4 post-BDL: −13%, p <0.0001; week 8 post-BDL: −32%, p <0.0001).

They also displayed a decrease in number of processes (decreased number of intersections, depending on the distance from the cell body: week 4 post-BDL: up to −45%, p <0.005; week 8 post-BDL: up to −73%, p <0.0001) (Fig. 5A).

In parallel, AQP4 staining, expressed in astrocytic feet lining microcapillaries, as well as within microcapillary endothelial cells at blood brain barrier (BBB), was increased in the hippocampus of BDL rats (weeks 4 and 8 post-BDL) as compared to sham-operated animals (Fig. 5C,D).

SECTION

Pearson correlations between brain metabolites, plasma values and behavioural tests

PARAGRAPH

Pearson correlation coefficients were used to identify dependences between measured parameters with the goal of highlighting metabolic pathways involved in the neurological changes associated with type C HE (Fig. 6).

First, the correlation between brain Gln and plasma NH4+ was highly significant (r = 0.61, p ≤0.0001).

As these 2 metabolites are considered responsible for many of the changes in HE, we further evaluated the correlations between plasma NH4+ or brain Gln with other metabolites or study parameters.

Elevation of plasma NH4+ correlated with the decrease in distance moved (r = −0.60, p ≤0.0001).

The correlation between brain Cr and brain Gln was stronger (p = 0.001) than the one with plasma NH4+ (p = 0.02).

In contrast, plasma NH4+ showed a significant correlation with brain Asc (p = 0.002), while brain Gln showed no correlation (p = 0.48).

As expected, brain Gln showed stronger correlations with the other brain osmolytes (Ins, tCho, Tau) than plasma NH4+.

In addition, Glu strongly correlated with brain Gln (p ≤0.0001), while the correlation with plasma NH4+ was less pronounced (p = 0.002).

PARAGRAPH

We also identified additional correlations between Glu and Cr, and Glu and other osmolytes (data not shown).

These correlations are most likely the direct consequence of increased brain Gln.

Given that their biological relevance is not yet understood, these correlations will not be discussed further.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The present study shows for the first time that significant neurometabolic changes are present in the rat hippocampus as early as 2–4 weeks after BDL: increases in plasma NH4+ and brain Gln, decreases in brain Cr and Asc, decreases of distance moved, and dysregulation of astrocyte morphology.

These compelling and novel findings are likely the premise of later changes and raise the question of whether similar changes might exist in humans but are missed owing to 1H-MRS methodological limitations both in field strength and echo times.

SECTION

Early neurometabolic events in CLD

PARAGRAPH

Little is currently known about the early neurometabolic events associated with CLD, something which we aimed to analyse using a detailed, longitudinal, in vivo analysis of an established model of type C HE at 4 time points.

We reasoned that focusing on early metabolic changes might shed light on which neurometabolic alterations are secondary to CLD alone, prior to the onset of complications associated with advanced, decompensated liver disease such as ascites, bleeding, infections, and malnutrition.4

Indeed, as early as 2 weeks post-BDL we observed increased plasma NH4+ (and bilirubin), brain Gln and decreased brain Cr and Asc (Fig. 3).

Given the ongoing progression of these early metabolic changes, they might be the biologically relevant premise underlying the histological and potentially the behavioural changes at 4 weeks and beyond (Figs. 3 and 6), together with other factors not assessed herein.

Since BDL rats at early time points were otherwise well and displayed satisfactory weight gain, the behavioural modifications at 4 weeks post-BDL are most likely attributable to early HE rather than secondary to systemic repercussions of end-stage liver disease.

PARAGRAPH

Brain Gln and plasma NH4+ were highly correlated in our BDL rats (Fig. 6), suggesting that Gln is probably the first metabolite influenced by increasing plasma NH4+, in agreement with our previous work.38

In addition, changes in plasma NH4+ correlated with the decrease in distance moved over the 8-week course of the disease (Fig. 6).

These findings have been historically difficult to verify in CLD for several reasons.

First, plasma NH4+ levels in CLD are both lower and more variable than in acute liver failure.8

Second, the use of low magnetic fields may have been limiting in human studies where brain Gln is not reliably quantified.

Finally, very few studies have been performed in animal models to date.

Only rare studies have identified a correlation between plasma NH4+ and brain Gln or severity of HE in CLD,29,44–46 while others did not find any correlation.37

PARAGRAPH

The behavioural changes observed in BDL rats are of interest since it is well known that patients with chronic HE exhibit impaired motor function,3,47 something also observed previously in rats 6 weeks post-BDL together with a decreased discrimination index for short term memory,48,49 altered spatial working and spatial reference memory (prefrontal cortex and hippocampal functions, respectively).50

Although the molecular underpinnings are still elusive, a number of neurotransmitter systems have been proposed to be involved.48,51

PARAGRAPH

NH4+-induced oxidative and nitrosative stress in CNS is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of HE, and there is growing evidence that osmotic and oxidative stress are closely related.52,53

Although Asc is an important CNS antioxidant preferentially located in neurons,54 the present study is the first to report an in vivo measurable Asc decrease in a model of chronic HE, occurring as early as 4 weeks post-BDL.

The decrease in Asc concentration over time correlated mainly with the rise in plasma NH4+ (Fig. 6).

Given that there was no correlation observed with brain Gln, this finding suggests a direct effect of NH4+ on CNS antioxidant pathways.52

The presence of systemic oxidative stress has also been shown in BDL rats.

Likewise, the synergistic effects of both NH4+ and systemic oxidative stress have been shown to increase brain water content.55

A close relationship was also previously shown between NH4+, precipitating factors, Gln, astrocyte swelling, NMDA receptor activation, oxidative stress, and the auto-amplificatory loop between astrocyte swelling and oxidative stress.4,16,52

All these factors lead to altered astrocyte function, glial/neuronal communication and multiple neurotransmitter systems, and thus impact synaptic plasticity and cerebral networks which may account for the signs and symptoms of HE.4,16,52

PARAGRAPH

It is commonly accepted in chronic HE that increased plasma NH4+ generates a rise in the osmolyte Gln leading to osmotic imbalance followed by a partial compensation through the gradual decrease of other brain osmolytes (Ins, tCho, Tau and Cr), thus leading to low grade brain oedema.5,13–16,38,45

Previous studies in BDL rats have reported an increase in brain water content (from ∼76% to ∼78% at 4 weeks or from ∼78% to ∼79% at 6 weeks post-BDL), while no changes were reported by other studies.39,55–57

The changes in brain water content appear to be small 1–2% and sometimes difficult to assess.13,58

However, this does not exclude the presence of astrocytic osmotic stress and/or morphological changes.59

Although several hypotheses have been elaborated to explain the relationship between neurometabolic changes, cell swelling/oedema and neurological outcome in chronic HE, these remain controversial.

PARAGRAPH

Among the potential metabolites implicated in osmoregulation, Cr was the first to decrease, as early as 2 weeks post-BDL (Fig. 3).

This decrease in hippocampal Cr correlated significantly with brain Gln rise.

The correlation was less strong with plasma NH4+ (Fig. 6), suggesting that the Cr decrease is a direct compensatory mechanism to Gln osmotic stress.

While Cr has been shown to efflux from astrocytes following osmotic challenge,60,61 we cannot exclude neuronal efflux as a mechanism for this decrease in Cr.

This is particularly relevant in the hippocampus given that hippocampal neurons are both known to harbour very high concentrations of Cr and to synthesize it.42,62

The release of osmotically active Cr by neurons in response to increases in Gln may hamper their function under CLD conditions, as their rate of Cr utilization is known to be high.63

The other measurable brain organic osmolytes (i.e. Ins, Tau, tCho) showed only a trend toward a decrease during this early period.

PARAGRAPH

Several changes were observed in astrocyte morphology starting 4 weeks post-BDL: decreased number and shortening of processes, as well as thickening of proximal processes.

These findings were further corroborated by an increase of AQP4 (a plasma membrane protein regulating water transport and homeostasis41) expression on the astrocytic feet around BBB and in microcapillary endothelial cells forming the BBB, a finding previously reported in cultured astrocytes exposed to ammonia and in BDL rats.64,65

Our data suggest that BDL-induced imbalance in osmolytes, as shown by 1H-MRS together with increased AQP4 immunostaining, likely leads to early osmotic stress.

The observed changes in astrocyte morphology might also be linked to their reactivity as previously shown in hyperammonemic rats without CLD,66 findings which need further validation in BDL rats.

Moreover, it has been previously shown that hyperammonemia and inflammation cooperate in inducing the neurological alterations in HE probably through altered neurotransmission.21,51,67

Therefore, our findings add to the body of literature by suggesting that early neurometabolic changes reflecting osmotic/oxidative stress and the related changes in astrocyte morphology might underlie the early neurobehavioral manifestations of HE among other existing factors, such as neuroinflammation and neurotoxins all of which are linked in a self-amplifying loop.4,11,21,23,52,66

Histological studies of BDL rat brains are controversial, some reporting no change, increased or decreased of GFAP staining in different brain regions.26,68,69

Regarding AQP4, a recent study showed reduced expression in the olfactory bulb and prefrontal cortex in BDL rats.50

Thus, additional studies in BDL rats would be useful to further our understanding of the changes/mechanisms/factors implicated in this animal model.

PARAGRAPH

We observed a rapid decrease of the sum of osmolytes (∼0.87 mmol/kgww) as early as 2 weeks post-BDL (Fig. 4C), concomitant to Gln increase.

Despite this prompt osmoregulatory response to the early rise in plasma NH4+and brain Gln, astrocytes displayed signs of osmotic/oxidative stress at 4 weeks post-BDL as shown by 1H-MRS, which coincided with the first observed astrocytic and behavioural changes, suggesting that osmoregulation was insufficient.

Several reasons may explain the apparent discrepancy between the rapid and ongoing osmotic response in hippocampus of BDL rats and the astrocytic osmotic imbalance observed later on.

First, osmolytes are measured as a mean in the voxel, which is not representative of cellular osmoregulation.

Second, most of these metabolites are differentially distributed among CNS cell types and cellular compartments, making it difficult to decipher their respective roles in osmoregulation using MRS. For example, Ins is preferentially concentrated in astrocytes, Tau in neurons, while Cr is ubiquitous.62,70,71

Third, choosing which metabolites to include in the sum is difficult for 2 reasons: the osmoregulatory role of some metabolites is controversial and osmotically active small ions (e.g. Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl−) and proteins, which also play important roles in osmoregulation, are not measurable by 1H-MRS.

Finally, brain NH4+ also acts as an osmolyte before being converted to Gln which might explain its correlation with Ins.

A previous study37 which reported higher brain osmolytes (sum of Gln, Glu, Ins, Tau) in BDL rats compared to sham-operated rats concluded that brain osmoregulation cannot compensate for the increase in both brain Gln and Lac.

In contrast to this study, we chose not to include Glu in our osmotic calculations, because most Glu is localized in synaptic vesicles and therefore does not contribute significantly to osmotic pressure in the cytoplasm.

SECTION

Late neurometabolic events in CLD

PARAGRAPH

Unlike previous studies, we followed rats to 8 weeks post-BDL.

To the best of our knowledge, there is only 1 published study of brain metabolism in BDL rats using in vivo 1H-MRS,39 examining rats at 4, 5 and 6 weeks post-BDL using a larger voxel (6.5 × 6.5 × 6.5 mm3).

It showed increased brain Gln and decreased Ins and tCho, in agreement with our results, but is of limited use for comparison with our data given the limited temporal analysis.

PARAGRAPH

As expected,38 brain Gln and plasma NH4+ continued to increase beyond the 4th week after ligation reaching a more than 2-fold increase at 8 weeks (Figs. 1 and 3) in line with the stronger decrease of other major brain osmolytes.

Ins showed the strongest relative and absolute decrease (−30%).

It was followed by Tau, Cr and consequently tCr.

tCho showed a significant decrease only at 8 weeks post-BDL (Fig. 3).

As expected, the main brain osmolytes correlated more significantly with Gln than with NH4+ (Fig. 6).

PARAGRAPH

Cr also continued to decrease until 8 weeks post-BDL (−11%).

The continuous decrease in Cr (also tCr) during the disease may be due to the direct toxic effect of NH4+ through inhibition of the enzyme arginine:glycine amidinotransferase involved in Cr synthesis,72 to the release of Cr by astrocytes in response to osmotic stress,40 or both.

The overall and progressive decrease in Cr in CLD brain may in turn lead to cellular energy dysfunction, through decreased cellular capacity to store energy rather than through direct PCr decrease, in keeping with our previous work demonstrating that PCr levels were stable in the same animal model using in vivo 31P-MRS.38

PARAGRAPH

Chronic HE has been linked repeatedly to disturbances in neurotransmission systems, although the mechanisms are incompletely understood.17,20

The cognitive and motor alterations in HE are believed to be the result of altered neurotransmission, mainly glutamatergic and GABA-ergic.51

Several metabolites involved in neurotransmission were reliably quantified in our study.

Glu concentration dropped at 6 weeks post-BDL, together with a trend toward declining concentrations of Asp and GABA.

Glu correlated strongly with brain Gln, while the correlation with plasma NH4+ was lower (Fig. 6), all findings in keeping with our previous data.38

The presumed reduction in Glu could simply be the result of NH4+ detoxification driven by increased Gln synthesis from Glu in astrocytes.

In support of this hypothesis, no significant changes in the Glu-Gln cycle between astrocytes and neurons were measured in a recent in vivo 13C-MRS study performed in the same animal model.73

The decline in Glu concentration may in turn induce the decrease in Asp, since the 2 metabolites are linked by transamination.

Although not measurable by 1H-MRS, this finding also raises the question of whether this change influences alpha-ketoglutarate.

Based on present data, it is important to emphasize that these changes are likely to arise at terminal stages of disease.

PARAGRAPH

Cerebral energy metabolism is believed to be altered in chronic HE, but findings on energy metabolism disturbances in chronic HE are inconsistent, and their direct role in the development and progression of brain oedema is not firmly established.74

NH4+ acts as a neurotoxin interfering with cerebral metabolism and possibly with energy pathways.

The secondary increase in Gln may impact energy metabolism through one of several mechanisms: initial osmotic stress, changes in the Glu-Gln cycle, or deleterious effects of cytotoxic brain oedema.

Lac, Cr and PCr, metabolites involved in energy metabolism, were reliably measured in our study (in particular separate detection of Cr from PCr).

While Cr showed a decrease in the brain of BDL rats, Lac and PCr did not change significantly, in keeping with previous studies,38,39 both in BDL rats.

However, they contrast with a previous report performed on post mortem rats 6 weeks post-BDL37 where increased cerebral Lac rather than Gln was suggested to be a key factor in the pathogenesis of brain oedema together with alterations in osmoregulation.

PARAGRAPH

The presence of oxidative stress as measured by decreasing Asc levels continued to be noticeable at late stages of the study.

GSH also showed a trend toward declining concentrations at 8 weeks post-BDL.

GSH is present at lower concentrations than Asc in brain, and therefore its estimation showed some variations which hindered statistical analysis.

Our previous study in a different brain region38 showed no changes in brain Asc, while GSH tended to decrease by 8 weeks post-BDL.

These different findings could reflect the differential vulnerability of distinct anatomical regions to CLD, something which requires further study.

SECTION

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

Using a multimodal, in vivo and longitudinal approach we have shown that biologically relevant neurometabolic changes in a rat model of chronic HE are already noticeable 2 weeks after BDL, and progress throughout the 8 week course of the disease.

The well-described increase in brain Gln in response to plasma NH4+ rise was confirmed, together with a decrease in brain Cr and Asc, both novel findings.

Brain Gln and plasma NH4+ were closely correlated, and plasma NH4+ correlated significantly with the decrease in distance moved by the animals.

In addition, Gln showed stronger correlations with other metabolites than plasma NH4+, suggesting that some of the changes are directly related to Gln increase rather than indirectly via NH4+ toxicity.

A decrease in brain organic osmolytes mirrored the rise in brain Gln concentration.

In addition, changes in astrocyte morphology together with an increase in AQP4 expression were observed as early as 4 weeks post-BDL, offering evidence that osmoregulation was incomplete in spite of these adaptive changes.

To conclude, these early changes are suggestive of osmotic and oxidative stress and are the likely premise of any of several later factors known to be involved in HE pathogenesis.

In addition, the novel finding of decreased cerebral Cr and Asc creates new opportunities to explore neuroprotective strategies for the treatment of HE.
