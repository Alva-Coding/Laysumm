TITLE

Longitudinal neurometabolic changes in the hippocampus of a rat model of chronic hepatic encephalopathy

PARAGRAPH

The sequence of events in chronic hepatic encephalopathy (HE) remains unclear, therefore using the advantages of in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 9.4T we aimed to test the hypothesis that neurometabolic changes are detectable very early in an established model of type C HE, offering insight into the primary events underpinning HE, before advanced liver disease confounds the findings.

These early, previously unreported neurometabolic changes occurred as early as 2 to 4â€¯weeks after bile-duct ligation, namely an increase in plasma ammonium and brain glutamine, a decrease in brain creatine and ascorbate together with behavioural and astrocyte morphology changes, and continued to progress throughout the 8-week course of the disease.
