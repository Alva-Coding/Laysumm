TITLE

Hepatitis B virus-induced modulation of liver macrophage function promotes hepatocyte infection

PARAGRAPH

Hepatitis B virus modulates liver macrophage function in order to favour the establishment and likely maintenance of infection.

It impairs the production of the antiviral cytokine IL-1β, while promoting that of IL-10 in the microenvironment.

This phenotype can be recapitulated in naive liver macrophages or monocyte-derived-macrophages ex vivo by short exposure to the virus or cells replicating the virus, thus suggesting an “easy to implement” mechanism of inhibition.
