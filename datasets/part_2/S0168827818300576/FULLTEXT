TITLE

No-touch multibipolar radiofrequency ablation vs. surgical resection for solitary hepatocellular carcinoma ranging from 2 to 5 cm

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Surgical resection (SR) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) represent two treatments of choice for the curative management of early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients not eligible for or awaiting liver transplantation.1–4

In the past, several studies mainly from Eastern centers suggested that RFA was as effective as SR for solitary HCCs of less than 2 to 3 cm.

Furthermore, it is associated with less procedure-related morbidity,5–8 resulting in better cost-effectiveness9 and quality of life.10

However, for larger lesions, SR appears to be superior to the various existing modalities of thermoablation, such as radiofrequency or microwave ablation in terms of local control and disease-free survival.8,11–14

Therefore, SR is currently considered the best therapeutic option in patients with intermediate-sized HCC ranging from 2 to 5 cm, with no contraindication for surgery.1,3,4,15

PARAGRAPH

No-touch multibipolar RFA (NTM-RFA) represents a novel technique of local ablation, which consists of the delivery of high-intensity energy between pairs of electrodes placed around the targeted tumor, enabling treatment of large lesions with safety margins according to the “no-touch” principle.16,17

It was recently reported as a more effective ablation technique than standard monopolar RFA in terms of histological response and local control, both for small (<3 cm) and large HCC.18,19

Thus, it may represent an alternative to SR for larger HCCs of up to 5 cm, but no comparative study between NTM-RFA and SR has yet been performed.20

PARAGRAPH

The aim of the present study was to compare the post-procedural and oncological outcomes of patients with a single HCC ranging from 2 to 5 cm treated with SR or NTM-RFA.

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Study population

PARAGRAPH

The study population consisted of adult patients who underwent elective hepatectomy or NTM-RFA for a solitary HCC ranging from 2 to 5 cm between September 2012 and December 2016 at a single tertiary center.

Patients previously treated for HCC with RFA, SR or any other specific therapy including transarterial chemoembolization and sorafenib were excluded.

All patient files were discussed at a weekly multidisciplinary team meeting dedicated to the management of HCC, and the final therapeutic decision for each patient was undertaken in the presence of hepatobiliary and transplant surgeons, onco-hepatologists, and interventional radiologists specialized in the management of hepato-pancreato-biliary diseases and highly experienced in the use of local ablation therapies.

The diagnosis of HCC was confirmed pathologically for patients receiving SR.

For patients undergoing NTM-RFA, the diagnosis of HCC was confirmed by either biopsy during the NTM-RFA procedure or according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) current HCC management guidelines.1,21

PARAGRAPH

The present study was approved by the institutional local ethics committee and the requirement for written informed consent was waived.

The study was performed in accordance with the 1975 Helsinki declaration.

A supplementary CTAT table was sent to the editorial office of the journal at the time of manuscript submission.

SECTION

No-touch multibipolar radiofrequency ablation

PARAGRAPH

All NTM-RFA procedures were performed under general anesthesia by one of three interventional radiologists experienced for more than four years in the management of hepato-biliary tumors (AR, AFM, JCJ).

All patients were treated with ultrasound guidance with the aim of achieving a complete tumor ablation including at least a 10 mm margin.

PARAGRAPH

Radiofrequency energy was provided by a 470-kHz radiofrequency generator (CelonLabPower; Olympus/Celon, Teltow, Germany), and 40 mm active 15-G internally cooled electrodes (CelonProsurg; Olympus-Celon) were used.

The electrodes were inserted into the liver with a parallel course and in extra-tumoral position.

The number of electrodes depended on tumor diameter: three needles were used for tumors of less than 3 cm, and four to five needles for tumors larger than 3 cm.

Needle-tract ablation was routinely performed during needle removal.

Any persisting tumorous disease inside the treated site within three months after initial NTM-RFA was not considered as a recurrence and was treated with a repeat NTM-RFA procedure.

SECTION

Surgical resection

PARAGRAPH

All SR were performed by one of four hepatobiliary surgeons (JYM, CD, ML, KM).

Procedures were performed by an open or laparoscopic approach according to the anticipated difficulty of the procedure.

Hepatic transection was performed under low central venous pressure using the Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) device (Valleylab, Boulder, CO, USA) and bipolar forceps.

When a laparoscopic approach was used, the Thunderbeat energy device (Olympus Medical Systems Corp., Tokyo, Japan) was used in addition to the latter devices.

The choice between performing an anatomical hepatectomy or a non-anatomical wedge resection was based on size, location and severity of patient status and underlying liver disease.

Achievement of safety margins of 2 cm were attempted whenever possible, except for tumors located close to major Glisson’s pedicles or hepatic veins, in which case a margin of 5 mm was considered acceptable.

The Pringle maneuver was used if necessary at the discretion of the operating surgeon.

SECTION

Endpoints and definitions

PARAGRAPH

The main endpoint of the study was the incidence of local recurrence after treatment.

Local recurrence was defined as any recurrence inside or abutting the treatment site.

In addition to that definition, we also assessed an alternative endpoint consisting of systematized recurrence, defined as any recurrence inside the treated hepatic segment or in an adjacent segment within a 2 cm distance from the treatment site.

The reason why we used two different definitions for local recurrence is because of the lack of a commonly-admitted standard definition.

It is well-established that HCC local recurrence is favored by the dissemination of micrometastases along the portal venous branches in the whole segment involved by the tumor,22,23 and it has also been demonstrated that a 2 cm margin after resection for HCC resulted in a better recurrence-free survival than a narrow margin of 1 cm.24

These previous findings support the use of systematized recurrence as an alternative endpoint for the assessment of tumor local control.

PARAGRAPH

The secondary endpoints were the rate of procedure-related adverse events occurring within 90 days after initial treatment, disease-free survival and overall survival.

Both survivals were calculated from the date of initial treatment to the date of disease recurrence or death.

Procedure-related adverse events were graded according to the Dindo-Clavien scaling system,25 and a complication of grade ≥3 was considered severe.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Categorical variables were expressed as counts and percentages, continuous variables were expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR).

Variables in the two groups were compared using Pearson’s χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and using the Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables.

PARAGRAPH

To overcome biases in baseline covariates between the two groups, we performed an inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using a propensity score.26

The propensity score was calculated using a multivariable logistic regression model with allocation of NTM-RFA as the endpoint.

All variables deemed to possibly influence treatment assignment or outcome were included in the model in a non-parsimonious manner.

These variables comprised age, sex, body mass index, Child-Pugh score, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, etiology of underlying liver disease, tumor size, subcapsular location of the nodule (defined as a nodule located less than 10 mm from the hepatic capsule) and platelet levels.

Weights for patients treated with NTM-RFA were the inverse of the propensity score, and weights for patients treated with SR were the inverse of 1 – propensity score.

The process of IPTW generates two new pseudo cohorts.

To avoid inflation of the sample size in the new pseudo cohorts, which may result in underestimation of the variance of the main effect and an increase in the type I error rate, we used stabilized weights by multiplying each weight by the marginal probability of the treatment without considering covariates.27

This process enabled us to preserve the sample size in the pseudo cohorts close to the original cohorts, albeit not strictly equivalent.

PARAGRAPH

Survival curves were built using the Kaplan-Meier method for both unadjusted and IPTW-adjusted cohorts.

Curves for the two treatment groups were compared using the log-rank test before IPTW-adjustment, and using a Cox univariable proportional hazard model with a robust variance estimator after IPTW-adjustment.28

A univariable Cox regression analysis was also performed in the entire IPTW-adjusted cohort to identify variables associated with local recurrence and systematized recurrence.

Variables with a p value <0.10 were simultaneously entered in a multivariable Cox model to identify independent variables associated with those two endpoints.

PARAGRAPH

All calculations were performed using SPSS software version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States).

All statistical tests were two-tailed and statistical significance was established for p values <0.05.

Results

SECTION

Patients characteristics

PARAGRAPH

During the study period, 141 consecutive patients presenting with a solitary HCC ranging from 2 to 5 cm who had never been treated before were enrolled.

Of these, 79 were treated with NTM-RFA and 62 with SR.

Before IPTW-adjustment, comparison of baseline characteristics between the two groups showed that there were significantly more male patients, larger tumors, a higher incidence of dyslipidemia and more subcapsular location of the tumor in the SR group, while patients in the NTM-RFA group had a significantly more advanced liver disease (as evidenced by higher MELD and Child scores), and a higher degree of portal hypertension (as evidenced by higher prevalence of esophageal varices, thrombocytopenia and pre-existing ascites) (Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

The IPTW-adjustment procedure generated two new pseudo cohorts of 72 and 56 patients in the NTM-RFA and SR groups, respectively.

After IPTW-adjustment, the two groups were no longer different for most baseline parameters including those deemed to potentially influence treatment selection, such as tumor size and location, alpha-fetoprotein level, etiology and severity of underlying liver disease (Table 1).

Smoking status was the only baseline variable that differed between the two IPTW-adjusted groups, but it was deemed to have no influence on treatment assignment and it was later found to have no impact on outcome variables.

SECTION

Treatment characteristics in the NTM-RFA group

PARAGRAPH

In the unadjusted NTM-RFA group, the procedure was performed percutaneously in 77 (97.5%) patients, while in two patients, the NTM-RFA procedure was performed through a laparoscopic access because the tumor was located in the liver dome, beneath the diaphragm.

The procedure was performed with three electrodes in 54 (68.4%) patients, with four electrodes in 23 (29.1%) patients, and with five electrodes in two (2.5%) patients.

The total amount of energy applied to the tumor was 89 kJ (IQR: 63–114) and the median intervention time was 21 mins (IQR: 16–30).

Creation of artificial ascites was necessary in 12 (15.2%) patients where tumors were near to the diaphragm or digestive tract.

In seven (8.9%) patients, the procedure was deemed incomplete on control imaging and was subsequently repeated within three months of the initial procedure.

SECTION

Treatment characteristics in the SR group

PARAGRAPH

In the unadjusted SR group, 40 (64.5%) patients were treated with an open approach, 16 (25.8%) were treated with a laparoscopic approach, and six (9.7%) were converted from laparoscopy to open surgery.

A preoperative portal embolization was performed prior to SR in seven (11.3%) patients.

Forty-four (71.0%) patients had a minor (≤2 segments) anatomical resection, 10 (16.1%) had a non-anatomical resection, and eight (12.9%) had a major anatomical resection.

A Pringle maneuver was used in 11 (17.7%) patients, median volume of estimated blood loss was 325 ml (IQR 100–600), an intraoperative transfusion of red blood cells was performed in eight (12.9%) patients, and median surgical time was 148 mins (IQR 120–214).

PARAGRAPH

Pathology of surgical specimens showed that an R0 resection was achieved in 59 (95.2%) patients, with a median minimal margin of 10 mm (IQR 5–16).

Satellite nodules were present in 18 (29.0%) patients, capsular invasion in 13 (21.0%), and microvascular invasion in 10 (16.1%).

According to the Edmondson-Steiner classification, eight (12.9%) tumors were of grade 1, 25 (40.3%) were of grade 2, 25 (40.3%) were of grade 3, and four (6.5%) were of grade 4.

SECTION

Adverse events and short-term outcome

PARAGRAPH

Outcomes of patients in the two IPTW-adjusted groups are presented (Table 2).

There was a higher rate of overall procedure-related adverse events in the SR group, but the rate of severe morbidity was not different between the two groups.

Post procedure ascites and wound infections occurred more frequently in the SR group, while there was no difference between the two groups in terms of respiratory complications and intra-abdominal abscesses.

Median hospital stay was significantly longer in the SR group.

A total of 21 (29.2%) patients in the NTM-RFA group and 15 (26.8%) in the SR group were considered for liver transplantation and were subsequently registered on the waiting list.

Of these, 15 (20.8%) and nine (16.1%) patients were eventually transplanted during the study period in the NTM-RFA and SR groups, respectively.

SECTION

Local recurrence

PARAGRAPH

Cumulative rates of local recurrence are presented (Fig. 1).

The rate of local recurrence was higher after NTM-RFA (5.5% vs. 1.9% at 12 months, 10.0% vs. 1.9% at 36 months), but the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.065).

Univariable IPTW-adjusted Cox regression analysis identified four factors associated with the risk of local recurrence (Table 3).

In multivariable analysis, pre-therapeutic levels of alpha-fetoprotein (HR 1.03 per 100 ng/ml; 95% CI 1.01–1.06) and hepatitis C infection (HR 5.75; 95% CI 1.18–28.14) were identified as independent predictors of local recurrence.

SECTION

Systematized recurrence

PARAGRAPH

The rate of systematized recurrence (i.e. any recurrence within the treated segment or in an adjacent segment less than 2 cm away from the treated tumor) was higher after NTM-RFA compared to SR (7.4% vs. 1.9% at 12 months; 27.8% vs. 3.3% at 36 months; p = 0.006) (Fig. 2).

In addition to treatment modality, univariable IPTW-adjusted Cox regression analysis identified four other factors associated with the risk of local recurrence (Table 4).

In multivariable analysis, treatment by NTM-RFA (HR 8.01; 95% CI 2.14–30.00) and pre-therapeutic level of alpha-fetoprotein (HR 1.03; 95% CI 1.01–1.05]) were identified as independent predictors of systematized recurrence, whereas an alcohol-related liver disease was identified as a protective factor.

SECTION

Extrahepatic recurrence

PARAGRAPH

An extrahepatic recurrence was encountered in four patients in the SR group (two with peritoneal carcinomatosis and two with distant lymph node dissemination).

In the NTM-RFA group, five patients developed an extrahepatic recurrence.

Of these, three patients presented with distant solid organ metastasis (lung, bone, and adrenal gland, respectively).

The two other patients both developed local peritoneal carcinomatosis, one of which was possibly related to tumor seeding along the NTM-RFA electrode caused by accidental tumor puncture.

SECTION

Management of intrahepatic recurrence

PARAGRAPH

Among the 42 patients with intrahepatic recurrence in the NTM-RFA group, 20 had a repeat NTM-RFA procedure, eight underwent transarterial chemoembolization, four had SR, three were administered sorafenib, two were treated by conformal radiotherapy and six underwent liver transplantation, including one patient who had NTM-RFA prior to transplantation.

Among the 22 patients with intrahepatic recurrence in the SR group, 10 patients were treated by NTM-RFA, four were treated by transarterial chemoembolization, two patients had repeat surgical resection, two were given sorafenib, one was treated by conformal radiotherapy, one was given best supportive care because of refusal for liver transplant, and five underwent liver transplantation, including two patients who had NTM-RFA and one who had transarterial chemoembolization prior to transplantation.

SECTION

Survival

PARAGRAPH

Before IPTW-adjustment, the one, three and five-year overall survival was 94.7%, 78.4% and 74.5% in the NTM-RFA group, and 98.3%, 85.2% and 63.1% in the SR group, respectively (log-rank p = 0.870).

The one, three and five-year disease-free survival was 66.5%, 23.7% and 17.8% in the NTM-RFA group, and 81.3%, 51.0%, and 36.0% in the SR group, respectively (p = 0.002).

PARAGRAPH

After IPTW-adjustment, the one, three and five-year overall survival rates were 96.6%, 86.7% and 86.7% in the NTM-RFA group, and 99.2%, 91.4% and 74.0% in the SR group, respectively (p = 0.954).

The one, three and five-year disease-free survival rates were 70.0%, 40.8% and 5.2% in the NTM-RFA group, and 82.0%, 56.4% and 46.9% in the SR group, respectively (p = 0.119) (Fig. 2).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The present study demonstrated that both NTM-RFA and SR achieved satisfactory oncological results for solitary HCC ranging from 2 to 5 cm.

While SR appeared to be superior in terms of local control of the tumorous disease, patients benefitting from NTM-RFA experienced less procedure-related adverse events and a shorter hospital stay compared to SR.

Similar disease-free and overall survivals were achieved after both treatments mainly because intrahepatic recurrent lesions were frequently accessible to additional curative therapies, regardless of the initial treatment modality.

PARAGRAPH

Currently, SR and monopolar RFA represent two treatments of choice for single HCC in patients not eligible or waiting for liver transplantation.

Surgical resection has several theoretical advantages over RFA: it provides substantial safety margins, thus treating potential satellite nodules, and it offers the possibility of analyzing the surgical specimen and searching for prognostic pathological indicators.

Conversely, monopolar RFA is a less invasive procedure, with a lower risk of liver disease decompensation.

Former studies suggested that both treatments achieved equivalent oncological results for HCCs of up to 2 cm.5–8

Therefore, monopolar RFA is now considered the best option for early lesions, provided there are no technical contraindications, such as a subcapsular location or an existing biliodigestive anastomosis.2,3

Conversely, several randomized or large scale retrospective studies have suggested that SR was superior to monopolar RFA for intermediate-sized HCCs of up to 3,15 412 or 5 cm.8,11

This could be linked to the fact that for lesions ranging from 2 cm to 5 cm, monopolar RFA requires the use of an overlapping technique with multiple monopolar probes and/or probe repositioning, which may result in untreated satellite nodules and limited capacity to produce a sufficiently large and homogeneous destruction, particularly near large vessels owing to the heat-sink effect.

PARAGRAPH

While all former comparative studies compared the results of SR to the standard monopolar RFA technique, the present study is the first comparing SR with NTM-RFA.

To overcome the technical issues behind the failure of monopolar RFA for large tumors, NTM-RFA provides homogenous high-intensity energy between probes placed around the targeted site, without tumor puncture, thus decreasing the risk of tumor seeding along the needle tract and incidental vascular tumor spread.29

A recent large multicenter case-matched study showed that NTM-RFA provided better primary ablation success and sustained local response than monopolar RFA for both large (>3 cm) and small (≤3 cm) HCC.20

Compared to monopolar RFA, NTM-RFA is also less affected by the heat-sink effect and could therefore be performed for HCC located close to major vessels.19,30

In the present study, the incidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis was similarly low in both groups.

This suggests that NTM-RFA is also suitable for subcapsular HCCs, which are usually contraindicated for monopolar radiofrequency or microwave ablation techniques using direct intratumoral puncture, owing to the risk of capsular rupture and subsequent peritoneal dissemination.

PARAGRAPH

In the present study, the rate of local recurrence as defined by any recurrence inside or abutting the treatment site was higher in the NTM-RFA group, but the difference observed was not statistically significant.

However, such a definition may underestimate the true incidence of local control failure, because of possible micrometastases that disseminate along portal branches and may be responsible for recurrence near the treated lesion, but not strictly adjacent to it.

Former studies suggested that anatomical resection (consisting of complete removal of the segment(s) involved) was superior to non-anatomical parenchymal sparing resection,22,23 and that a wide margin of 2 cm was superior to a narrow 1 cm margin in terms of local control.24

Therefore, we also analyzed an alternative endpoint, namely systematized recurrence, consisting of any recurrence within the treated segment or in an adjacent segment within a 2 cm distance from the treated lesion, and we found that SR provided a significantly better local control when considering the latter endpoint.

PARAGRAPH

Despite substantial differences between the two treatment modalities in terms of tumor local control, overall survival and disease-free survival were similar in the two groups.

This was mainly explained by the possibility to treat patients with local or intrahepatic distant recurrence with repeat NTM-RFA with a curative intent.

Indeed, compared to SR, NTM-RFA remains a minimally-invasive treatment, which does not jeopardize the possibility of offering further treatment in previously treated patients, even in the case of intrahepatic distant recurrence.

In a retrospective series of 115 patients treated for a single primary HCC with RFA, Okuwaki et al. reported a 51% rate of intrahepatic distant recurrence, half of which were successfully treated with repeat RFA.31

In that study, patient survival rates observed in patients treated for intrahepatic recurrence with repeat RFA were similar to those without intrahepatic recurrence.

In another retrospective study comparing RFA to repeat hepatectomy in patients with recurrent HCC, Liang et al. found no difference in terms of overall survival between the two treatments, while patients treated with repeat hepatectomy experienced more major complications after the procedure.32

These findings provide additional evidence regarding the capacity of RFA to successfully and readily treat recurrent HCC after both primary RFA or previous SR.

PARAGRAPH

One of the main advantages of local ablation over surgery lies in its reduced invasiveness.

In view of the satisfactory long-term oncological results achieved in the NTM-RFA group, the latter treatment could be offered to patients that are not amenable to surgery because of comorbidities or severity of underlying liver disease, without compromising the long-term oncological results.

Since the NTM-RFA technique is recent, concerns could be raised regarding its reproducibility.

However, in the present study, three different interventional radiologists performed the procedures successfully, thus suggesting that the technique is reproducible with no steep learning curve.

PARAGRAPH

Consistent with former reports,5–8 the rate of total procedure-related morbidity in the present study was significantly higher in the SR group.

This was mainly related to a higher incidence of wound-related complications and post-procedure ascites observed after surgery, which makes NTM-RFA a less invasive procedure than SR.

Nevertheless, the rate of severe morbidity in this series could be considered low (5.6% after NTM-RFA, 12.5% after SR) and was not statistically different between the two groups.

Improvement of perioperative management in patients undergoing surgery, an increasing use of the laparoscopic approach (more than one-third of patients in the present study) and a relatively infrequent use of the Pringle maneuver (17.7% of patients) with no major blood losses in the majority of patients (median blood loss value of 325 ml) may have contributed to this low rate of severe morbidity after surgery.

In this context, SR could still be considered as a treatment of choice for patients with intermediate-sized HCC.

PARAGRAPH

In addition to type of treatment, the present study identified alpha-fetoprotein level and viral hepatitis C as independent factors associated with poorer local control, while the presence of an alcohol-related liver disease had a protective effect on systematized recurrence.

These data confirm the findings of previous studies supporting the prognostic impact of high alpha-fetoprotein33,34 and hepatitis C virus-related HCC.35

Interestingly, the present study did not find any impact of tumor size on the risk of local recurrence in both univariable and multivariable analysis.

It has long been established that tumor size has a strong impact on the risk of HCC recurrence after monopolar RFA.36–38

During monopolar RFA, the amount of energy is delivered in a centrifugal manner from the center to the periphery of the needle.

Thus, large tumors exceeding the size of the circular area of destruction may be incompletely treated.

Conversely, NTM-RFA produces extensive and homogeneous tissue necrosis between the needles, and the quality of tumor destruction is less influenced by tumor size, provided the needles have been properly placed around the whole tumor.

Additionally, by placing the needles at a distance from the tumor periphery according to the no-touch principle, NTM-RFA treats an area beyond the macroscopic boundaries of the tumor, thus providing some safety margins, an important protective factor against local recurrence.24

PARAGRAPH

This study had some limitations.

Because of its retrospective setting, the two groups were not comparable for several baseline characteristics that may have influenced the outcomes analyzed.

Indeed, NTM-RFA was offered to patients with a more advanced liver disease whereas SR was usually offered to patients with larger tumors.

Nevertheless, we used a robust methodology to overcome these biases and after adjustment using stabilized IPTW, we obtained two new pseudo cohorts that were comparable for potential confounders, thus improving the reliability of our findings.

PARAGRAPH

The management of patients presenting with solitary HCC relies on a sequential approach, based on the use of multiple treatment modalities including surgery, local ablation therapy and liver transplantation.

In this study, the rates of local recurrence after NTM-RFA and SR were not significantly different, while SR provided a lower rate of systematized recurrence.

Thus, SR appears to remain the best possible treatment option (apart from liver transplantation) for patients presenting with solitary HCC ranging from 2 to 5 cm and with no contraindication for surgery.

However, NTM-RFA represents an interesting alternative to surgery for solitary HCC of 2 to 5 cm as it is associated with less overall morbidity and despite a higher rate of systematized recurrence, NTM-RFA as a first-line modality of entry in the therapeutic process does not negatively impact the oncological results.

Indeed, the majority of patients with local or distant intrahepatic recurrence could safely benefit from repeat NTM-RFA or other rescue treatment, resulting in prolonged survival and/or the ability to further benefit from liver transplantation.

Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings.
