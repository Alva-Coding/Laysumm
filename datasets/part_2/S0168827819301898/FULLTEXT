TITLE

Immunogenomic landscape of hepatocellular carcinoma with immune cell stroma and EBV-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are biologically heterogeneous at the molecular level, and thus diverse molecular subgroups based on large-scale exome or transcriptome profiling have been identified.1–4

This oncologic background may prevent novel molecular-targeted agents from significantly improving survival rates in patients with HCC.5

Immune checkpoint inhibitors, including anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and anti-programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), are emerging as potential anti-HCC agents,6,7 and a unique immune class specific for HCC was recently defined based on gene expression profiling of tumor tissues.8–10

PARAGRAPH

However, the immunogenic subgroup of HCC defined by gene expression profiling may not always correspond to the immunogenic subgroup defined histologically.

In fact, immune cells act in a variety of locations and under various conditions, such as on the periphery of tumors, and as secondary inflammatory reactions to bile duct obstruction and/or ischemic tumor cell necrosis, so that histologic evaluation of tumor tissue is useful for identifying true intra-tumor immune cell infiltration.11

Therefore, a combined analysis of histology and gene expression in tumors and their microenvironments should be able to identify more reliable immunogenic subtypes of HCCs.

Moreover, the subgroup of HCC with marked immune cell infiltration defined histologically has been reported to have favorable prognosis.12,13

However, the microenvironmental and genomic features of this HCC subgroup with immune cell stroma (HCC-IS) have not been identified.

PARAGRAPH

Among many tumors with marked lymphoid cell infiltration, a few epithelial carcinomas, such as lymphoepithelioma-like gastric cancers and head & neck undifferentiated carcinomas, develop in response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and those tumors typically contain a lymphoid-rich stroma.14,15

EBV positivity in these EBV-driven epithelial carcinomas was found only in the epithelial cancer cells, not the lymphocytic cells.14,15

However, there have been no convincing reports of HCC infected by EBV, and moreover the status of EBV in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is unclear.

Considering that EBV-infected B lymphocytes can induce cellular immune responses,16 identifying EBV particles in TILs and determining their clinical role may be keys to understanding the pathogenesis of the HCC-IS subtype.

PARAGRAPH

Herein, we have identified the HCC-IS subtype by microscopic evaluation in a large HCC cohort primarily undergoing curative resection.

We have also investigated the genomic and immunomolecular characteristics of the subgroup, focusing particularly on the EBV status of TILs and its prognostic relevance.

SECTION

Patients and samples

PARAGRAPH

We searched the electronic medical records of Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea between 2005 and 2016 for patients who had received their first curative resection for HCC, to identify HCC-IS.

Sixty patients were initially selected, and all selected patients had descriptions of lymphoid stroma, lymphoid reaction, or lymphoid hyperplasia in their pathology reports.

A hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slide review excluded 5 patients with predominantly neutrophil infiltration, a hemorrhage-associated lymphoid reaction, or severe chronic hepatitis-associated lymphoid infiltration.

Twenty patients with necrosis-associated lymphoid infiltration preoperatively treated with transarterial chemoembolization or radiofrequency ablation were also excluded.

We initially also used 231 patients from our previous study for the conventional HCC (C-HCC) group;4 these patients had also received a first curative resection for HCC.

However, after reviewing the H&E slides, 12 of the cases (5.2%) were reclassified as the HCC-IS subtype.

Therefore, 47 patients were finally classified as having HCC-IS and the remaining 219 patients as having C-HCC.

We defined the selection criteria for HCC-IS in detail as follows: an HCC with prominent intra-tumoral immune cell stroma with/without lymphoid follicles; these should not be associated with i) predominant portal area inflammation and/or active cirrhosis (cirrhosis with variable inflammation and liver cell damage along the fibrotic band); ii) hepatolithiasis and/or cholangitis; iii) immune cell infiltration associated with secondary degeneration such as tumor necrosis, hemorrhage, or fibrosis; and iv) major infiltration of non-lymphocyte immune cells such as neutrophils, eosinophils or plasma cells associated with an infectious response or a different immune environment.17,18

PARAGRAPH

The procedure for selecting the included cases is summarized in Fig. S1.

This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center.

The institution review board waived the requirement to obtain informed consent by anonymized retrospective study.

SECTION

Immunohistochemical staining and evaluation

PARAGRAPH

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues (n = 266) were immunohistochemically stained with antibodies for PD-1, PD-L1, 5-methylcytosine (5MeC), and acetylated histone H3 lysine 9 (AcH3K9), using a Bench Mark XT automatic immunostaining device according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

PD-L1 expression in tumor cells (PDL1-Tumor) and in TILs (PDL1-TIL) and PD-1 expression in TILs (PD1-TIL) were scored using an immunoreactivity scoring system (IRS) based on the percentage and staining intensity of stained cells (Table S1).

Intra-tumoral immune cells with an IRS score ≥1 for PD1-TIL or PDL1-TIL, and an IRS score of ≥3 for PDL1-Tumor were defined as positive for the corresponding marker.

5MeC and AcH3K9 expressions in the nucleus of tumor cells were evaluated, and background lymphocytes served as positive controls.

The percentage of stained tumor cells (0–100%) was used as an estimate of 5MeC and AcH3K9 expression.

SECTION

EBV-encoded RNA-in situ hybridization

PARAGRAPH

EBV-encoded RNA-in situ hybridization (EBER-ISH) was performed using a Bench Mark XT autostainer (Ventana Medical Systems) with a Ventana ISH iVIEW Blue Detection Kit (Ventana Medical Systems) in all FFPE tissue samples.

The density of EBV-positive TILs was measured as the number of EBV-positive TILs per high power field (EBV/HPF).

High and low EBV positivity were defined as >10 EBV/HPF, and present but ≤10 EBV/HPF, respectively.

SECTION

Multiplex immunofluorescence staining and analysis

PARAGRAPH

Multiplex immunofluorescence staining was performed with an Opal™ 7-color Automation immunohistochemistry (IHC) Kit with a Leica Bond Rx™ Automated Stainer on the 44 HCC-IS samples.

The expression of PD-1, PD-L1, CD8, and CD3 was visualized with a tyramide signal amplification (TSA®) Plus Opal system.

The expression of CD3 and CD8 was quantified as positive cell density (cell number per mm2), which was measured as cell number per field/0.36 in the Opal system.19

The expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was evaluated as percentages of positive cells (0–100%).

SECTION

DNA sequencing and data processing

PARAGRAPH

All fresh tissues for next-generation sequencing were obtained from the Bio-Resource Center in the Asan Medical Center.

We used whole exome sequencing (WES) data newly performed on fresh tumor and matched surrounding non-neoplastic tissues from 8 HCC-IS, combined with binary alignment map and mutation annotation file data for 206 cases with matched RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from our previous study.4

SECTION

Somatic copy number analysis

PARAGRAPH

We used a Affymetrix CytoScan HD Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for the 206 cases from our previous report4 and binary alignment map files for the 8 newly added cases.

SECTION

RNA sequencing and data processing

PARAGRAPH

RNA-seq data were generated from 214 fresh tissues available in the Bio-Resource Center of our center.

The normalized gene expression data were deposited in GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) (Accession number, GSE124751 and GSE124752).

SECTION

Profiling of tumor-infiltrating immune cells

PARAGRAPH

CIBERSORT20 was used to quantify absolute proportions as the immune scores of the various tumor-infiltrating immune cell types in tumor tissues from the normalized gene expression data generated by RNA-seq of the 214 samples.

The total immune score was defined as the sum of the estimated immune scores for each cell type.

Immune phenotypes were classified based on the previously defined immune8 and stromal21 classifiers with a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 5% defining significance of prediction.

SECTION

Gene set enrichment and pathway analyses

PARAGRAPH

To conduct gene set enrichment and pathway analyses, we used V6.1 dataset from the Molecular Signatures Database.22,23

To assess the gene set enrichment scores of individual samples, gene set variation analysis (GSVA) scores were calculated from the normalized gene expression data using GSVA v1.24.2.24

SECTION

Human leukocyte antigen typing

PARAGRAPH

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles were predicted at 4-digit resolution using the RNA-seq data of the 214 samples.

The WES data of the 8 pairs of tumors and matched non-tumors newly generated in this study were used to check the consistency of the HLA typing results between the datasets.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Overall survival (OS) was measured from the day of tumor resection to the date of death or last follow-up.

Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was assessed from the day of tumor resection to disease recurrence or last follow-up.

Results

SECTION

Characteristics of HCC-IS and EBV positivity in the tumor stroma

PARAGRAPH

We first compared the clinicopathological features of HCC-IS (n = 47) with those of C-HCC (n = 219) (Table S2).

HCC-IS patients were older (p = 0.027), and had smaller tumors (p <0.001) and a higher Edmondson-Steiner grade measured by the worst grade (p = 0.006).

Rare architectural patterns (p <0.001), and rare cell types (p = 0.005), were more frequent in HCC-IS.

Lymphoid follicles were observed only in the HCC-IS (p <0.001).

Representative histological images are shown in Fig. 1A and S2A-D.

PARAGRAPH

We performed a quantitative analysis of the stromal areas occupied by immune cells using the Opal system (Fig. 1B).

The area of the immune cell stroma was significantly greater in HCC-IS (p <2.2e-16, Fig. 1C).

Mean stromal area was 27.2% (SD ± 8.1%) in HCC-IS, and no difference in the mean stromal area was observed between the tumor margin (28.2 ± 7.5%; red area in Fig. 1B) and the central tumor area (26.1 ± 9.7%; yellow area in Fig. 1B).

Although an enlarged immune stromal area was also present in 28C-HCC, this was always associated with active cirrhosis (n = 10, Fig. 1C), necrosis (n = 11), hemorrhage (n = 6), or stones (n = 1), based on the H&E slides.

The best estimate of the cut-off percentage of immune stromal area for discriminating between C-HCC and HCC-IS was 19.5% (Fig. 1D).

Patients with HCC-IS had a better RFS than those with C-HCC (p <0.001, Fig. 1E), and HCC-IS was an independent prognostic factor for RFS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.23; 95% CI 0.09–0.59; p = 0.0021) (Table S3).

The patients with HCC-IS tended to survive longer, although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.155, Fig. 1E).

PARAGRAPH

We evaluated EBV positivity using EBER-ISH on whole slide sections of all 266 samples, and compared the status of tumor cells and intra-/extra-tumoral immune cells.

EBV positivity was detected in 74.5% of HCC-IS and 4.6% of C-HCC (p <0.001; Fig. 1F), and the mean numbers of EBV-positive TILs/HPF per sample were 10.5 ± 26.4, and 0.2 ± 1.0, respectively (p <2.2e-16; Fig. 1G).

Only intra-tumoral immune cells were positive for EBV; no EBV positivity was detected in tumor cells or extra-tumoral lymphoid cells.

Ten tumors in the HCC-IS group had a relatively high density of EBV positivity (>10 positive cells/HPF), while only 1 in the C-HCC group did (Fig. 1G, right side).

EBV positivity was only present in CD20-positive TILs and was not observed in CD68-positive macrophages (Fig. 1H and S2E).

SECTION

Genomic alterations characteristic of HCC-IS

PARAGRAPH

The somatic mutations and mutational signatures of HCC-IS (n = 19) were compared with those of C-HCC (n = 195).

The landscape of gene mutations and mutational signatures, along with associated clinicopathological features including EBV status, are summarized in Fig. 2A.

An interesting finding was that CTNNB1 mutations were encountered more frequently in C-HCC (47/195), than in HCC-IS (0/19, p = 0.016).

The COSMIC signature 22, which is associated with aristolochic acid and present in urothelial carcinomas and liver cancers,25 was rarer in HCC-IS than in C-HCC (Fig. 2A and S3), but the overall mutation burden did not differ between the 2 groups (median value 1.86 mutations/Mb in HCC-IS vs. 2.02 mutations/Mb in C-HCC; p = 0.105).

In terms of somatic copy number variation, 1q21, 1q44, 8q23, 8q24, and 11q13 amplifications; and 10q22, 10q26, 13q13, 13q14, 16q24, and 17p13 deletions were significantly associated with C-HCC, whereas 10q11 amplifications and 18p11 deletions were associated with HCC-IS (Fig. 2B and S4).

SECTION

Profiling of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment

PARAGRAPH

We investigated the tumor-infiltrating immune cell types in the HCCs using CIBERSORT20 and the RNA-seq data from the 214 samples (Fig. 3).

The total immune score, the sum of 22 leukocyte cell fractions, was significantly higher in HCC-IS than in C-HCC (mean score 0.796 vs. 0.297; FDR q = 6.85e-08; Table S4).

More precisely, the immune scores of 11 of the 22 immune cell types, including B cells, CD8 T cells, CD4 memory T cells, and macrophages, were significantly higher in HCC-IS than in C-HCC (Fig. 3A and Table S4).

The correlation between CD8 T cell expression assessed by the CIBERSORT and Opal methods was significant in the analysis of 16 of 19 HCC-IS cases, excluding 3 without matched RNA-seq data (p = 0.014 and rho = 0.605; Fig. 3B), suggesting that immune cell profiling based on RNA-seq data is reliable.

Pathway analysis revealed that CD28 costimulatory signaling, T cell receptor signaling, IL2 signaling, and Toll receptor signaling pathways were upregulated in HCC-IS compared to C-HCC (Fig. 3C).

PARAGRAPH

Next, we investigated the relative proportions of different immune cell types in subgroups according to HCC type and EBV positivity (Table S5).

The greatest proportional difference in a cell type between C-HCC and HCC-IS was observed for CD8 T cells (8.9% vs. 22.6%, p = 1.18e-07 and FDR q = 1.30e-06; Fig. 4A and Table S6).

The proportion of CD8 T cells did not differ from that of CD4 T cell in HCC-IS (22.6% vs. 17.1%; p = 0.1301), whereas it was lower in C-HCC (8.9% vs. 20.1%, p <0.001; Fig. 4A).

A similar finding was obtained in the HCC subtypes according to EBV positivity (Fig. 4B and S5A).

However, there was no significant difference in the proportions of macrophages, another major immune cell type, between the 2 HCC subtypes (38.8% for C-HCC vs. 33.5% for HCC-IS; p = 0.063 and FDR q = 0.166; Table S6).

The proportions of CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and macrophages did not differ according to EBV positivity in any of the subgroups stratified by HCC type (Fig. 4C and 4D), which suggests that immune cell profiles based on quantitative measurements are associated more with HCC type than with EBV positivity.

SECTION

Global methylation and histone acetylation patterns

PARAGRAPH

We evaluated global methylation and histone acetylation patterns in tumor cells according to HCC type and EBV positivity, using IHC of 5MeC and AcH3K9.26

More pronounced global hypermethylation was identified in HCC-IS compared to C-HCC, with mean percentages of stained cells per sample of 84.5% vs. 58.7%, respectively (p = 4.4e-07; Fig. 4E).

However, we found no significant difference in DNA methylation pattern according to EBV positivity (Fig. 4E).

These findings point to a relationship between immune cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment and DNA methylation of the cancer cells.

Global histone acetylation patterns did not differ between the groups (Fig. S5B).

SECTION

Associations between HCC type or EBV positivity and expression of PD-1 and PD-L1

PARAGRAPH

We evaluated PD-L1, PD-1, CD3, and CD8 expression by Opal in 44 HCC-IS; and PD-L1 and PD-1 expression by IHC in the entire 266 cases.

Significant correlations were observed between the IHC and Opal data for PD1-TIL (p = 5.9e-09), PDL1-TIL (p = 0.0038), and PDL1-Tumor (p = 2.4e-07) (Fig. 5A).

Based on IRS scores by IHC, PDL1-TIL, PDL1-Tumor, and PD1-TIL were significantly overexpressed in HCC-IS (Fig. 5B).

In particular, 66.0% (31 out of 47) of HCC-IS were positive for PDL1-Tumor (IRS score ≥3), but only 22.4% (49 out of 219) of C-HCC.

The IHC expression patterns of PD-L1 and PD-1 in all 266 cases are shown in Fig. 5C. Based on the Opal data for the 44 HCC-IS, PDL1-Tumor was significantly correlated with intra-tumoral CD8 T cell density (p = 0.013); both PDL1-TIL and PDL1-Tumor positivity were closely correlated with PD1-TIL (p = 5.89e-08 and p = 6.58e-08, respectively; Fig. S6).

The number of EBV-positive TILs was also correlated with PDL1-Tumor positivity by Opal (rho = 0.4 and p = 0.0034; Fig. 5D).

SECTION

Immune checkpoint-related gene expression according to HCC type and EBV positivity

PARAGRAPH

The median normalized expression levels of various immune checkpoint-related genes27 were significantly different across the 4 subgroups: EBV-negative C-HCC (subgroup 1, n = 186); EBV-positive C-HCC (subgroup 2, n = 9); EBV-negative HCC-IS (subgroup 3, n = 5); and EBV-positive HCC-IS (subgroup 4, n = 14) (Fig. 6A).

Specifically, the median levels of 23 inhibitory genes and 37 stimulatory genes were similar in subgroups 2, 3, and 4, and significantly greater than in subgroup 1 (Fig. 6B), suggesting that EBV-positive C-HCC was also similar with HCC-IS in terms of its immunomodulatory gene expression pattern.

HLA class I and II genes were highly expressed in HCC (Fig. 6A).

We also evaluated HLA class I molecular types (both genotype and supertype) from the RNA-seq data (n = 214).

When we compared the relevant results using the tumor DNA and matched non-tumor DNA data, along with the tumor RNA-seq data for 8 cases, the HLA typing results were consistent (Fig. S7).

The frequencies of HLA class I molecular types among all HCCs are shown in Fig. 6C.

These frequencies agreed well with those previously reported in 5,082 Koreans.28

No significant disparities in HLA supertype or genotype (FDR q >0.05) were found according to EBV status and HCC type after adjusting nominal p values (Fig. 6D and S8).

In a survival analysis by HLA type, supertype B58 displayed inferior OS and similar PFS to the other types (p = 0.008 and p = 0.092, respectively; Fig. 6E).

SECTION

Potential clinical implications of EBV positivity in HCC

PARAGRAPH

EBV positivity was associated with HCC type (HCC-IS vs. C-HCC), age, and various immune cell types in univariate logistic regression analysis; however only HCC type and age were significant in multivariate analysis (Fig. 7A and Table S7).

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that EBV positivity was associated with better RFS (p = 0.0016), but not OS (p = 0.9997) (Fig. 7B).

However, we noted a different survival effect according to the density of EBV-positive TILs in HCCs: high EBV positivity was significantly associated with poorer RFS and OS in the totality of cases, as well as in each HCC subtype (Fig. 7C and S9A).

This association was independent of other clinicopathological variables (aHR 25.4 for RFS, p <0.001; aHR 9.6 for OS, p = 0.003; Tables S8 and S9).

The HR for RFS increased with the density of EBV-positive TILs, with a plateau at >5 EBV-positive TILs/HPF (Fig. 7D).

SECTION

Association between high EBV positivity and increased CD8 T cell exhaustion

PARAGRAPH

We further analyzed microenvironmental immune status using the RNA-seq data because the strongly EBV-positive cases were associated with poor prognosis in spite of the infiltration of sufficient immune cells into the tumors.

Based on the RNA-seq data (n = 214), the expression of 252 genes (FDR q <0.05; Fig. 7E) was related to the density of EBV-positive TILs by Spearman’s correlation analysis, and using the 252 gene set, the immunodeficiency pathway defined by KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) was significantly enriched in HCCs that were highly positive for EBV (FDR q = 1.3e-09; Fig. 7F and S9B).

We further classified our HCCs (n = 214) into the 4 subgroups using both immune8 and stromal21 classifiers (Fig. S10, and Tables S10 and S11): immune-exhausted (n = 53, 24.8%); immune-active (n = 18, 8.4%); immune-desert (n = 62, 29.0%); and not-assigned (n = 81, 37.9%) subgroups were identified and their characteristic features are summarized in Fig. 8A.

The immune-exhausted phenotype was more common in the high EBV-positive group (3 out of 4, 75%) than in the low EBV-positive group (5 out of 10, 50%) (Fig. 8B and S11).

In addition, a significantly higher CD8 T cell exhaustion score (Table S12), as assessed by GSVA analysis,29 was obtained in the high EBV-positive group than in the rest of the groups in an analysis of the totality of cases (p = 3.23e-08; Fig. 8C), as well as in a limited subgroup of 19 HCC-IS (p = 0.021; Fig. 8D).

The upregulated CD8 T cell exhaustion signature was stronger in the high EBV-positive HCC-IS group (n = 4), than in the low EBV-positive HCC-IS group (n = 10) (FDR q = 0.0296; Fig. 8D).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

HCCs with abundant TILs have been consistently described as having good prognosis12,13,30; however, little is known about the type of HCC involved.

Based on our histological and immunogenomic results, we could define the unique characteristics of the HCC-IS category as follows: i) marked intra-tumoral CD8 TILs; ii) favorable recurrence outcomes; iii) high frequency of intra-tumoral EBV-positive TILs; iv) strong expression of immune checkpoint proteins such as PD-1 and PD-L1; v) rarity of CTNNB1 mutations; and vi) increased global hypermethylation.

PARAGRAPH

We also found that HCC-IS were genetically different from C-HCC in terms of their somatic mutation patterns, especially of CTNNB1 mutations.

The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is an important oncogenic signaling pathway related to immune evasion.31.

Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway causes extinction of T cells from the microenvironment, and CTNNB1-mutated HCCs display reduced immune cell infiltration.8,31–33

These previous findings agree well with the absence of CTNNB1 mutations in the current HCC-IS series.

PARAGRAPH

Recently, DNA hypermethylation has been reported as an epigenetic consequence of EBV infection in gastric cancer.34

However, although global hypermethylation was more prevalent in HCC-IS than C-HCC, there was no significant effect of EBV positivity per se on the global methylation level in our HCC samples.

This difference may be related to the fact that in the HCCs, the EBV was present in TILs not in the actual tumor cells, in contrast to the situation in gastric cancer.

PARAGRAPH

In the present study, CD8 TILs were the dominant subset of immune cells in the HCC-IS subtype, and EBV was found only in the fraction of CD20-positive TILs.

EBV infections in the tumor microenvironment affected clinical outcomes differently depending on the histological virus burden, indicating a potential prognostic effect in the post-carcinogenic period rather than a causal role in hepatocarcinogenesis.

PARAGRAPH

While HCC-IS had a favorable prognosis, those with a high density of EBV-positive TILs had poorer outcomes regardless of their HCC type.

Further analysis based on immune and stromal classifiers indicated that the HCCs with high EBV burdens were enriched for functionally defective exhausted T cells, which can attenuate anti-tumor immunity in various cancers.35

This observation may explain the paradoxical effect of density of EBV-positive TILs on the prognosis of patients with HCC.

PARAGRAPH

Although a pathogenic role of EBV infection in the immunological milieu of HCC cannot be clearly identified from our results, such infection seems to contribute to immune cell infiltration as a result of the induced activation of lymphocytes and macrophages.16,36

Conversely, T cell exhaustion due to a prolonged anti-cancer inflammatory response may lead to reactivation of EBV from a chronic latent state.

PARAGRAPH

In terms of application, our data suggest a potential clinical use of EBV positivity for stratifying patients with HCC with regard to prognosis and treatment options.

Indeed, high- level expression of immunomodulator genes in EBV-positive HCC may presage good responses to the immune checkpoint inhibitors.

PARAGRAPH

Although we did not examine EBV serology in this study, East Asia including Korea is an EBV endemic area, and almost the entire population has a chronic latent infection.37

Therefore, the status of EBV serology may have had no impact on the results of this study.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, HCC-IS has unique prognostic, genomic, and pathologic features, and is associated with a specific cancer microenvironment containing a high frequency of EBV-positive TILs.

Exhausted immune function may contribute at least in part to the negative effect of high density of EBV-positive TILs on survival.

Our findings identify a novel HCC entity that is essential for immunohistological classification and accurate management of patients with HCC.
