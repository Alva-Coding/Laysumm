TITLE

Small molecule-mediated reprogramming of human hepatocytes into bipotent progenitor cells

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Currently, liver transplantation represents the only approved standard of care for patients with end-stage liver diseases.1

Experimental studies in rodents and clinical trials of hepatocyte transplantation have shown that direct infusion of mature hepatocytes may serve as an alternative to whole organ replacement in some cases.

However, hepatocyte transplantation only results in a partial and relatively short-term correction of liver dysfunction, and has been hampered by numerous issues related to the shortage of donor tissue, limited numbers of cells suitable for transplantation, and a low efficiency of engraftment in the abnormal microenvironment of diseased livers.2–4

In addition, human hepatocytes are difficult to maintain and expand in vitro because of the lack of adequate environmental signals.

Typically, mature hepatocytes have low proliferative potential and easily become apoptotic in culture which reduces their therapeutic value.

PARAGRAPH

To facilitate the development of cell-based therapies for treating liver disease, over the last decade much effort has been directed towards the potential use of pluripotent stem cells capable of indefinite self-renewal, including embryonic stem cells (ESCs),5–8 induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs),9–11 mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),12–14 and hepatic progenitor cells.15–18

Despite the important advances in generating stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells from pluripotent cells, their clinical applications are impeded by their low efficiency of hepatic differentiation,19 the likelihood of immune rejection,20 high risk of cancer development,21,22 as well as low rate of proliferation and rapid loss of differentiation potency in culture.23

In addition, the therapeutic use of iPSCs and ESCs could be compromised by the possibility of genetic transformation and/or ethical issues.24,25

MSCs are generally reported not to form teratomas, but they have a small total cell yield and inefficient hepatic differentiation,26 which limits their potential use in clinic.

More recently, a 3D organoid culture system for human liver has been established27 which allows for the generation of highly stable bipotent progenitor cells capable of bi-lineage differentiation both in vitro and in vivo, but is technically challenging due to a multi-step process of cell isolation, selection and long-term expansion.

PARAGRAPH

New technological advances in the direct reprogramming of somatic cells by a defined set of small molecules simplified and shortened the process of generating integration-free progenitor-type cells.28–30

In particular, Katsuda et al. identified a combination of only three small molecules, Y-27632, A83-01, and CHIR99021, which was very effective in converting terminally differentiated rat and mouse but not human hepatocytes to bipotent progenitor cells.31

PARAGRAPH

We report that mature human hepatocytes isolated from healthy and diseased donor livers could be rapidly converted into a bipotent state when treated with 2 small molecules A83-01 and CHIR99021 (AC) in combination with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF).

We further show that these chemically derived human hepatocyte progenitors (hCdHs) could sustain themselves as a population of progenitor cells over a long period while maintaining chromosomal stability and the capacity to differentiate into functional hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells (BECs) in vitro and in vivo, highlighting their potential for biomedical applications.

Generation of chemically derived human hepatocyte progenitors

PARAGRAPH

The study was performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea (HYI-16-229-3).

Human liver tissues were obtained from six donors operated on in Hanyang University Medical Center (Table 1) with patients’ informed consent.

Hepatocytes were isolated using a modified 2-step collagenase perfusion technique32 as described in detail in the supplementary material and methods section.

Hepatocytes were seeded on collagen-coated dishes (STEMCELL Technologies, BC, Canada) at 5,000 cells/cm2 in basic high glucose DMEM/F-12 media (Gibco, CA, USA) containing 1% FBS (Gibco), 10 mM nicotinamide (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA), 0.1 μM dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% insulin-transferrin-selenium (Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), and 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Peprotech, NJ, USA).

After overnight incubation, the basic medium was supplemented with 4 μM A83-01 (Gibco) and 3 μM CHIR99021 (STEMCELL Technologies), and 20 ng/ml of HGF (Peprotech), designated reprogramming medium.

The reprogramming medium was changed every day.

Cells were passaged using 1X TrypLE Express Enzyme (Gibco) when they reached 80% confluence and split at a ratio of 1:3–1:5 every fifth day.

In total, at least 2–3 independent clonal lines were established for each of six donor liver samples.

SECTION

Differentiation studies

PARAGRAPH

To induce hepatic differentiation, hCdHs were plated on collagen-coated dishes (STEMCELL Technologies) at 1,000 cells/cm2 in hepatocyte induction media consisting of the basal medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml oncostatin M (R&D Systems, MN, USA), 10−7 M dexamethasone (Sigma) and 20 ng/ml HGF.

The medium was changed every 2 days.

After 6 days, the cultures were overlaid with the hepatocyte induction medium containing Matrigel at a 1:7 ratio (BD Biosciences, CA, USA).

On day 8, the cultures were washed with Hank’s balanced salt solution (Welgene) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.

PARAGRAPH

For cholangiocyte differentiation, we employed a 3D culture system using collagen type 1 (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

In brief, 1 × 105 hCdHs were re-suspended in DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% FBS and 20 ng/ml HGF (Peprotech, USA), designated cholangiocyte differentiation medium (CDM), and mixed on ice with an equal volume of CDM supplemented with collagen type 1 after adjusting pH to 7.0.

The cell suspension was then transferred to a 6-well plate and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to let the gel form.

Thereafter, the cultures were overlaid with CDM and cultured for 7 days.

At least 3 independent experiments were performed for each differentiation assay.

Transplantation experiments

PARAGRAPH

The NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) (C57/BL background, Jackson Laboratory, USA), Fah−/−/Rag2−/−/Il2rg−/− on the NOD-strain background (FRGN) (C57/BL background, kind gift by Markus Grompe, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR, USA), and Alb-TRECK/SCID mice (C57/BL background, kind gift by Dr. Taniguchi, Yokohama City University, Japan) were housed and cared for under specific pathogen-free conditions with 12 h light/12 h dark cycle in accordance with the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care and the Guide for the Use of Laboratory Animals of Samsung Biomedical Research Institute (20170116003, 20160203002) and HYU Industry-University Cooperation Foundation regulations (2016-0212A).

Liver damage was induced in the eight to ten week old female NSG mice by a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of Jo2 antibody (BD Pharmingen, USA) at 0.2 mg/kg (NSG mice),33 in the 8–10-week old female Alb-TRECK/SCID mice,34 by a single i.p. injection of diphtheria toxin (Sigma) at 2 μg/kg, and in the 8–10-week old female FRGN mice by gradual withdrawal method (for 48 h) of 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC).35

FACS-sorted mCherry-positive hCdHs (P4-6, 106 per mouse) were transplanted into the inferior pole of the spleen 24 h after injection of Jo2 or diphtheria toxin, or 48 h after NTBC withdrawal.

Liver repopulation was evaluated at 2 and 8 weeks (NSG mice), 3 weeks (Alb-TRECK/SCID mice) and 1 week (FRGN mice) after the transplantation of mCherry-tagged hCdHs (n = 3 mice, each time point/model) using Virtual Microscope AxioScan.Z1 (Zelss, German).

Results

SECTION

Generation of human chemically derived hepatic progenitors

PARAGRAPH

In our initial work, we have adopted the methodology recently described by Katsuda et al.31 In support of their data, we found that a cocktail of three small chemicals, Y27632, A83-01, and CHIR99021 (YAC), which was very effective in reprogramming of mouse and rat hepatocytes, did not support the conversion process in human hepatocytes (Fig. S1A, B).

The YAC-treated human hepatocytes rapidly died off without proliferation.

PARAGRAPH

To overcome this problem, we looked for additional hepatic factors which could increase the efficiency of the conversion process.

Given the key contribution of HGF in liver organogenesis, regeneration, and the maintenance of hepatic progenitor cells,36–38 we optimized the reprogramming medium to include HGF.

After testing different sets of small molecules in the presence of HGF, the most effective was a combination of HGF and 2 small molecules, A83-01 and CHIR99021 (AC) referred to as HAC hereafter.

PARAGRAPH

Exposure of human primary hepatocytes (hPHs) to HAC triggered a robust expansion of small epithelial cells with high nuclear-to-cytoplasm ratio typical of progenitor-type cells.

Within the first 10–15 days of treatment with HAC, these cells, termed hCdHs, showed a steady increase in the expression of classical hepatic progenitor marker genes and proteins, such as AFP, CK19 (KRT19), EPCAM, SOX9, etc. (Fig. 1A, B).

Consistent with effective reprogramming, the derived hCdHs expressed pluripotency stem cells markers OCT4 (POU5F1), NANOG and SOX2 (Fig. 1C), and endoderm markers SOX17, CXCR4 and GATA4 (Fig. S2A).

Significantly, hCdHs displaying hepatic progenitor cell marker expression could be effectively generated from the frozen human hepatocytes (Fig. 1D; Fig. S2B).

PARAGRAPH

To extend the analysis of lineage stage-specific transcriptional changes during the conversion process, we next compared the gene expression profiles of hCdHs with human primary hepatocytes, fetal liver, as well as human fibroblasts and hepatic stellate cells.

As expected, unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression data revealed that reprogrammed hCdHs clustered together with fetal liver and hPHs but not with fibroblasts or hepatic stellate cells (Fig. 1E).

Notably, the following gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that among the significant molecular changes found in hCdHs was a clear enrichment of several published stem cell-related gene sets (Fig. 1F).39,40

Thus, the induction of stem cell-related genes is essential for small-molecule-mediated reprogramming of terminally differentiated human hepatocytes to a stem cell state.

PARAGRAPH

We next traced the fate of single human hepatocytes plated at low density (10 cells per 6 well) and grown in the HAC reprogramming medium.

Images taken every 24 h showed that a single hepatocyte went through a first division by 72 h, and produced an offspring colony containing on average 20 cells by 192 h (range 15–40, n = 10 examined cells) (Fig. S2C).

Time-lapse microscopy confirmed these observations (Video S1).

PARAGRAPH

In total, the cultures of hCdHs were established as independent clonal lines from hepatocytes isolated from both healthy and diseased livers (Table 1).

Importantly, all clonal cell lines displayed similar hepatic progenitor phenotype, while maintaining chromosomal integrity and normal chromosome numbers (Fig. 1G; Fig. S2D).

The following results refer to the hCdHs clonal lines established from a healthy donor liver (donor 1) unless otherwise indicated.

SECTION

HGF facilitates generation of hCdHs through activation of ERK 1/2 signaling

PARAGRAPH

To further validate the role of HGF in the generation of hCdHs, we isolated human hepatocytes and cultured them in the reprogramming medium in the presence or absence of AC and HGF (Fig. 2A).

HGF supplementation for 7 days significantly increased the proliferation of hCdHs as judged by a 5-fold increase in their number (Fig. 2B).

Treatment with either HGF or AC alone failed to produce a population of progenitor-like cells (Fig. 2A, B), underlining the importance of the concurrent activation of HGF and the inhibition of TGFβ- and GSK3-mediated signaling caused by A83-01 and CHIR99021, respectively, for the reprogramming of adult human hepatocytes.

PARAGRAPH

To assess the function of HGF, we then analyzed the activity/phosphorylation status of its cognate receptor MET and primary downstream effectors implicated in the control of proliferation and differentiation.37,41,42

As anticipated, upon stimulation of hPHs with HGF, the MET receptor was tyrosine-phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner with a peak activation at 1 h (Fig. 2C).

Among the known downstream targets of MET, we observed increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (MAPK3/1), but not AKT or STAT3 (Fig. 2C).

We confirmed that HGF-mediated activation of MET and ERK was not affected by AC (Fig. 2D).

PARAGRAPH

To verify the HGF/MET specific effects, we blocked the activity of MET and ERK1/2 by the selective inhibitors SU11274 and U0126, respectively.

SU11274 and U0126 prevented phosphorylation of both MET and ERK1/2 (Fig. 2E) and blocked the HGF-mediated hCdHs expansion as judged by total cell count (Fig. 2F) and morphological features (Fig. S3A).

The growth in the presence of increasing concentrations of SU11274 caused a dose-dependent reduction in the number of hCdHs (Fig. S3B, C).

Thus, persistent HGF/MET signaling was required to establish and maintain hCdHs proliferation through a mechanism involving ERK1/2 activation.

SECTION

Long-term maintenance and differentiation potential of hCdHs in vitro

PARAGRAPH

Phenotypically, hCdHs sustained themselves as a population of undifferentiated progenitor cells for at least 10 passages.

They continued to proliferate with a similar growth rate (Fig. 3A, Fig. S4) and expressed comparable levels of hepatic progenitor markers as shown by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis (Fig. 3B) and fluorescence staining (Fig. 3C).

Karyotyping of metaphase cells at passages 1 and 10 also did not reveal any chromosomal alterations (Fig. 3D).

PARAGRAPH

Since the defining attribute of progenitor cells is their ability to multi-lineage differentiate to their tissue of origin,43,44 we then examined the differentiation potency of hCdHs using standard lineage-specific differentiation assays in vitro.

Notably, during the transition of hCdHs to hepatocyte-like cells (hCdH-Heps), the expression of endoderm-associated markers SOX17, CXCR4 and GATA was decreased (Fig. S2A) while expression of mature hepatocyte-related genes and proteins was strongly induced as assessed by RT-qPCR analysis (Fig. 4A, Fig. S5A, B), double fluorescence confocal microscopy, glycogen and MitoTracker staining (Fig. 4B).

In support of these findings, the hCdH-Heps also displayed significant increases in albumin secretion (Fig. 4C), CYP1A2 activity (Fig. 4D), and urea synthesis (Fig. 4E).

Likewise, the differentiation towards hCdH-Heps was associated with improved canalicular function as demonstrated by the uptake and release of indocyanine green (Fig. S5C), fluorescein diacetate (Fig. S5D), and a parallel upregulation of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters such as MRP2 (SYCE1L) (Fig. 4A) and BSEP (ABCB11) (Fig. S5A).

Consistent with the acquisition of a more mature hepatic state, hCdH-Heps showed an increase in mitochondria mass (Fig. 4B, k-l) as well as a strong induction of key genes involved in the control of mitochondrial function, such as ATP5G1 (ATP5MC1), POLG, POLG2, TFAM, and UCP2, which were undetectable in hCdHs (Fig. S5B).

PARAGRAPH

Importantly, hCdHs retained the differentiation potency upon long-term culture.

hCdHs subjected to the hepatocyte differentiation protocol at different passages showed a comparable induction of the mature hepatocyte markers (Fig. 4F, G).

hCdHs were also capable to differentiate towards the biliary epithelial cell lineage when grown in a tree-dimensional culture system.45

They acquired biliary marker expression (Fig. 4H; Fig. S5E) and formed a tube-like branching morphology characteristic of cholangiocyte differentiation as shown by morphology and staining with fluorescein diacetate (Fig. 4I; Fig. S5F).

SECTION

Transcriptional remodeling during differentiation of hCdHs towards hepatocytes

PARAGRAPH

To gain a more extensive understanding of the global gene expression changes during hCdHs differentiation towards hepatocytes, we compared transcriptomes of hCdHs and hCdH-Heps with human hepatocytes and fetal liver.

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed a close relationship between hCdH-Heps and adult hepatocytes (Fig. 5A).

Furthermore, GSEA generated using a liver specific gene list of 244 genes46 confirmed a strong induction of the hepatic gene expression program in hCdH-Heps, whereas hCdHs showed a negative correlation, consistent with a less differentiated phenotype (Fig. 5B).

Many of the differentially expressed genes in hCdH-Heps were involved in the diverse biological processes associated with hepatocyte functions, including glucose, lipid, cholesterol and xenobiotic metabolism (Fig. S6).

PARAGRAPH

To further characterize our hCdH-Heps, we compared their global similarities with different cohorts of hepatocyte-like cells and primary hepatocytes.

Hepatocyte-like cells were generated by different strategies and from different cell sources such as ESCs (hESC-Heps),47 iPSCs (hiPSC-Heps), direct reprogramming of human fibroblasts (hiHeps)48 and liver progenitor-like cells (hep-LPCs-Heps).

A clustering analysis of gene expression patterns of our samples and publicly available sequencing data from GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) revealed that among the hepatocyte-like cells of various cell origin, the hCdH-Heps showed the closest clustering and highest correlation with primary hepatocytes in the correlation map (Fig. 5C, D).

Of note, hep-LPCs-Heps clustered closer to our hCdH-Heps and human hepatocytes than to hepatocyte-like cells obtained from ESCs, iPSC, or by direct reprogramming of fibroblasts, most likely because of the retention of residual transcriptional memory of donor cells.49

The expression patterns of hiPSC-derived hepatocytes were the most distant from primary hepatocyte gene sets.

PARAGRAPH

As an indicator of unbiased clustering, the transcriptomic profiles of primary human hepatocytes sequenced in this study and published by Gao et al.48 were remarkably similar despite the differences in the sequencing platforms (HiSeq2000 vs. HiSeq2500), type of sequencing (paired-end vs. single end), and amount of raw throughput (∼7GB vs. ∼1.3 GB).

These results establish that our hCdH-Heps most faithfully recapitulate the transcriptomic profile of human hepatocytes compared to hiPSC- and hESC-derived hepatocytes, and thus could represent a better model system for regenerative medicine.

SECTION

Differentiation potential of hCdHs in vivo

PARAGRAPH

Finally, we tested whether hCdHs can differentiate into functional hepatocytes and cholangiocytes when implanted in vivo.

For this purpose, we used a novel model of Alb-TRECK/SCID mice which develop a fulminant hepatic failure after 1 dose of diphtheria toxin.34

One million of hCdHs transfected with mCherry reporter gene for easy tracking were transplanted via the spleen into Alb-TRECK/SCID mice 24 h after diphtheria toxin injection.

Liver repopulation was assessed by confocal microscopy and the presence of human albumin and A1AT in the recipient mouse serum.

hCdHs successfully engrafted and repopulated about 20% of the diseased parenchyma by 3 weeks after transplantation into Alb-TRECK/SCID mice (Fig. 6A) which was paralleled by a steady increase in secretion of human albumin (Fig. 6B) and A1AT (Fig. 6C).

Significantly, the albumin levels reached >1 µg/ml which was similar to that found in the Alb-TRECK/SCID mice at 8 weeks after transplantation of human hepatic stem cells34 and about 10-fold higher than in FRGN mice 2 months after they received injections of 5 × 106 iPSC-Heps (114 ± 50 ng/ml) or hiHeps (153 ± 42 ng/ml).48

In comparison, blood concentrations of human albumin in FRGN mice repopulated with 1×106 human hepatocytes varied between 5–10 µg/ml at later time after transplantation (4–5 weeks).35

Given that the transplanted hCdHs were undifferentiated when engrafted in mouse liver and their continuing expansion and maturation in the hepatic microenvironment, the secretion of human albumin is expected to rise in parallel with increasing repopulation.

PARAGRAPH

As a proof of principle, we also used 2 additional mouse models of hepatic xenorepopulation, including NSG (NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) and FRGN mice.

In these models, liver injury was induced either with a single injection of Jo2 antibody in NSG mice or caused by a withdrawal of NTBC in FRGN mice.

Functional characterization of NSG mice injected with 106 mCherry-positive hepatocytes showed that the majority of mCherry-positive cells acquired properties characteristic of mature hepatocytes.

They stained positive for HNF4α, a key driver of hepatocyte maturation, and expressed comparable levels of human albumin as the neighboring mCherry-negative hepatocytes at 2 and 8 weeks after injection (Fig. S7A).

Some engrafted hCdHs differentiated towards cholangiocytes as shown by co-expression of mCherry with CK7, a lineage-specific marker of biliary epithelial differentiation (Fig. S7A).

No tumors were found at 8 weeks after transplantation (endpoint of observation).

Likewise, albumin-expressing mCherry-positive hepatocytes were found in FRGN mice 1 week after transplantation (Fig. S7B) while some hCdHs differentiated towards cholangiocytes as shown by CK7 staining (Fig. S7C).

As a further demonstration of the successful engraftment and repopulation, we detected a steady increase in the expression levels of human sex-determining region on Y chromosome (hSRY) in the recipient FRGN mouse livers (Fig. S7D).

These results indicate that bipotent hCdHs can repopulate injured liver and acquire functional properties of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes upon exposure to an adequate hepatic microenvironment.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this study, we used a recently developed strategy for cell fate modification by small molecules to directly convert human hepatocytes to bipotent hepatic progenitor cells with potential for transplantation therapy.31

Specifically, 2 small molecules, including A83-01 and CHIR99021, which inhibit TGFβ and GSK3 signaling, respectively, were effective in the reprogramming of mouse and rat hepatocytes31 and mouse fibroblasts50 into bipotent progenitor-type cells.

However, the attempt to reprogram human hepatocytes to a hepatic progenitor state using the defined set of small molecules was ineffective, suggesting a requirement for additional conversion factors.31

PARAGRAPH

Consequently, we tested different combinations of growth factors frequently used in the diverse culture systems to facilitate proliferation and lineage commitment of hepatic precursors of rodent and human origin, including HGF, BMP4, FGF4, retinoic acid, etc.5,12 The addition of HGF, a key driver of liver stem cells, to a cocktail of only 2 small molecules A83-01 and CHIR99021 (AC), proved to be essential for the conversion of adult human hepatocytes to bipotent progenitors hCdHs.

Treatment with any single factor, either HGF or AC, did not support the conversion process.

Furthermore, blocking the HGF-mediated activation of the MET signaling pathway by the specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU11274 dramatically attenuated the generation of the reprogrammed hCdHs.

In particular, inhibition of the MET-initiated activation of ERK1/2 by U0126 was found to significantly decrease the number of hCdHs, consistent with the role of ERK1/2 signaling in supporting regenerative proliferation and self-renewal of hepatic progenitor cells.51,52

The highly efficient generation of hCdHs by a combination of 2 small molecules and HGF may be related to a partial reprogramming, unlike the full reprogramming of somatic cells of different origin which requires more reprogramming factors.45

Further work is needed to address the molecular mechanisms underlying direct conversion of hepatocytes to a pluripotent state.

PARAGRAPH

The reprogrammed hCdHs acquired characteristics ascribed to hepatic progenitor-like cells.

They formed spheroids in ultra-low attachment culture dish (data not shown) and expressed both hepatic (AFP) and cholangiocytic (CK19) marker genes and proteins.

Importantly, hCdHs displayed high proliferative potential, and could maintain themselves as a population of undifferentiated precursors without obvious chromosomal abnormalities for at least 10 passages.

When subjected to differentiation assays in vitro, these cells were capable of differentiating into both hepatocytes and BECs, as assessed by the expression of lineage-specific markers and acquisition of mature functions.

Importantly, the differentiation potency of hCdHs did not change upon long-term culture.

PARAGRAPH

Transcriptome profiling corroborated these findings showing extensive transcriptional remodeling in the reprogrammed hCdHs.

Thus, GSEA performed to assess lineage stage-specific transcriptional memory revealed the activation of progenitor genes as an essential element of the small molecule-mediated hepatocyte fate conversion process.

In comparison, a strong induction of the hepatic gene expression program upon hepatic maturation in vitro indicated the efficient differentiation of the commitment of hCdHs towards hepatic lineage.

Functional annotation of key expression changes in hCdH-Heps established a significant enrichment of genes involved in glucose, lipid, cholesterol and xenobiotic metabolism.

PARAGRAPH

Finally, we provide evidence that hCdHs could differentiate into both functional hepatocytes and cholangiocytes when implanted in vivo.

Upon transplantation into an acute hepatic failure Alb-TRECK/SCID mouse model,34 hCdHs acquired mature hepatocyte properties and secreted more serum albumin in mouse serum compared to either hepatic progenitor cells or hESC- or hPSC-derived hepatocytes,52 implying that hCdHs possess a greater hepatocyte-forming potential in vivo.

PARAGRAPH

Remarkably, the gene expression profiles of hCdH-Heps clustered closer to adult human hepatocytes than any of the hESC- or hiPSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells suggesting that retention of lineage-specific donor memory may facilitate hepatic differentiation for therapeutic application.49

These data were corroborated by similar findings in 2 additional mouse models of therapeutic liver repopulation, including a model of acute liver injury induced by Jo2 antibody53 in NSG mice and Fah−/−/Rag2−/−/Il2rg−/− mice.33–35

Of note, in the Jo2 model, the transplanted cells did not have a competitive growth advantage because the remaining healthy hepatocytes were capable of proliferating and regenerating the injured parenchyma.

Nevertheless, hCdHs successfully integrated into the diseased parenchyma and acquired properties characteristic of mature hepatocytes and BECs.

The latter is consistent with the findings by Katsuda et al.31 using the mouse hepatic progenitor cells (CLiPs) reprogrammed by a similar strategy as our hCdHs for liver repopulation in the uPA/SCID mouse model.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, we describe the first successful culture system for reprogramming human hepatocytes into bipotential progenitor cells with regenerative potential.

Our approach of combining HGF with 2 small molecule inhibitors allows for the generation of a significant number of patient-specific hepatic progenitors and opens new avenues for development of personalized care strategies in cell-based regenerative medicine.
