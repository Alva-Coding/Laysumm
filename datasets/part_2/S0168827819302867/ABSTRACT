ABSTRACT

TITLE

Arterial subtraction images of gadoxetate-enhanced MRI improve diagnosis of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma

PARAGRAPH

Although gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows higher sensitivity for diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), its arterial-phase images may be unsatisfactory because of weak arterial enhancement.

We investigated the clinical effectiveness of arterial subtraction images from gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI for diagnosing early-stage HCC using the Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) v2018.

PARAGRAPH

In 258 patients at risk of HCC who underwent gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI in 2016, a total of 372 hepatic nodules (273 HCCs, 18 other malignancies, and 81 benign nodules) of 3.0 cm or smaller were retrospectively analyzed.

Final diagnosis was assessed histopathologically or clinically (marginal recurrence after treatment or change in lesion size on follow-up imaging).

The detection rate for arterial hyperenhancement was compared between ordinary arterial-phase and arterial subtraction images, and the benefit of arterial subtraction images in diagnosing HCC using LI-RADS was assessed.

PARAGRAPH

Arterial subtraction images had a significantly higher detection rate for arterial hyperenhancement than ordinary arterial-phase images, both for all hepatic nodules (72.3% vs. 62.4%, p <0.001) and HCCs (91.9% vs. 80.6%, p <0.001).

Compared with ordinary arterial-phase images, arterial subtraction images significantly increased the sensitivity of LI-RADS category 5 for diagnosis of HCC (64.1% [173/270] vs. 55.9% [151/270], p <0.001), without significantly decreasing specificity (92.9% [91/98] vs. 94.9% [93/98], p = 0.155).

For histopathologically confirmed lesions, arterial subtraction images significantly increased sensitivity to 68.8% (128/186) from the 61.3% (114/186) of ordinary arterial-phase images (p <0.001), with a minimal decrease in specificity to 84.8% (39/46) from 89.1% (41/46) (p = 0.151).

PARAGRAPH

Arterial subtraction images of gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI can significantly improve the sensitivity of early-stage HCC diagnosis using LI-RADS, without a significant decrease in specificity.
