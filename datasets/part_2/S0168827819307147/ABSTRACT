ABSTRACT

TITLE

Alginate microencapsulated human hepatocytes for the treatment of acute liver failure in children

PARAGRAPH

Liver transplantation (LT) is the most effective treatment for patients with acute liver failure (ALF) though with the limitations of surgical risks and the need for life-long immunosuppression.

Transplantation of microencapsulated human hepatocytes in alginate is an attractive option over whole liver replacement.

The safety and efficacy of hepatocyte microbeads transplanted intraperitoneally has been shown in animal models.

We report our experience of the use of this therapy in children with ALF on named patient basis under a MHRA Specials Manufacture License.

PARAGRAPH

Clinical grade human hepatocyte microbeads (HMBs) and empty microbeads (EMBs) were tested in immunocompetent healthy rats.

Subsequently, eight children with ALF, who were awaiting a suitable allograft for LT, received intraperitoneal transplantation of HMBs.

We monitored complications of the procedure, assessed the host immune response and residual function of the retrieved HMBs either after spontaneous native liver regeneration or at the time of LT.

PARAGRAPH

Intraperitoneal transplantation of HMBs in healthy rats was safe with preserved synthetic and detoxification functions without the use of immunosuppression.

Subsequently, eight children with ALF received HMBs (4 neonatal haemochromatosis, 2 viral infections and 2 children with unknown cause at time of infusion), median age of 14.5 days, range 1 day - 6 years.

The procedure was well tolerated without complications.

Of the 8 children, 4 avoided LT while 3 were successfully bridged to LT following the intervention.

HMBs retrieved after infusions (at the time of LT) were structurally intact, free of host cell adherence and contained viable hepatocytes with preserved functions.

PARAGRAPH

The results demonstrate the feasibility and safety of a HMB infusion in children with ALF.
