TITLE

Alginate microencapsulated human hepatocytes for the treatment of acute liver failure in children

PARAGRAPH

Acute liver failure in children is a rare but devastating condition.

Liver transplantation is the most effective treatment, but it has several important limitations.

Liver cell (hepatocyte) transplantation is an attractive option, as many patients only require short-term liver support while their own liver recovers.

Human hepatocytes encapsulated in alginate beads can perform the functions of the liver while alginate coating protects the cells from immune attack.

Herein, we demonstrated that transplantation of these beads was safe and feasible in children with acute liver failure.
