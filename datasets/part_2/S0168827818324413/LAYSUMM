TITLE

Ketoconazole exacerbates mitophagy to induce apoptosis by downregulating cyclooxygenase-2 in hepatocellular carcinoma

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy worldwide and remains a major clinical challenge.

Our study reveals that ketoconazole, a broad-spectrum antifungal agent, activates PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy by downregulating COX-2, consequently resulting in the acceleration of apoptosis and thereby inhibiting the growth of HCC.

Furthermore, ketoconazole acts synergistically with sorafenib in the suppression of HCC growth in vitro and in vivo.
