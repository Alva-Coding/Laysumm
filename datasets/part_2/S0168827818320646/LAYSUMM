TITLE

Macrophages contribute to the pathogenesis of sclerosing cholangitis in mice

PARAGRAPH

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an inflammatory liver disease which often progresses to liver failure.

The cause of the disease is unclear and therapeutic options are limited.

Therefore, we explored the role of white blood cells termed macrophages in PSC given their frequent contribution to other human inflammatory diseases.

Our results implicate macrophages in PSC and PSC-like diseases in mice.

More importantly, we found that pharmacologic inhibition of macrophage recruitment to the liver reduces PSC-like liver injury in the mouse.

These exciting observations highlight potential new strategies to treat PSC.
