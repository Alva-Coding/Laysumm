TITLE

Tick-tock hedgehog-mutual crosstalk with liver circadian clock promotes liver steatosis

PARAGRAPH

The results of our investigation show for the first time that the Hh signaling in hepatocytes is time-of-day dependent, leading to differences not only in transcript levels but also in the amount of Hh ligands in peripheral blood.

Conversely, Hh signaling is able to feed back to the circadian clock.
