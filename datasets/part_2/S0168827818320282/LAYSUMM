TITLE

JNK1 induces hedgehog signaling from stellate cells to accelerate liver regeneration in mice

PARAGRAPH

Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (so called ALPPS), is a new two-staged approach to hepatectomy, which induces an unprecedented acceleration of liver regeneration, enabling treatment of patients with liver tumors that would otherwise be considered unresectable.

Herein, we demonstrate that JNK1-IHH signaling from stellate cells is a key mechanism underlying the regenerative acceleration that is induced by ALPPS.
