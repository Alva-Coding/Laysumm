TITLE

JNK1 induces hedgehog signaling from stellate cells to accelerate liver regeneration in mice

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

The unique ability of mammalian liver to regain mass after tissue loss has revolutionized the treatment and cure of many patients with liver tumors.

However, there are limitations to effective regeneration, as hepatic failure may develop after extensive liver resection.

This entity, known as the small-for-size syndrome (SFSS), results from an insufficient functional volume of the liver remnant and remains the most frequent cause of death due to liver surgery.1,2

Two-staged hepatectomies were introduced to reduce the SFSS risk.

Typically, the portal vein draining the part of the liver containing the tumor is occluded (step 1), causing growth of the contralateral liver part (defined as the functional liver remnant [FLR]); when the FLR has gained sufficient functional volume, step 2 (resection of the diseased part) is performed.2,3

Nevertheless, in some cases regeneration is still insufficient, or the considerable time period between step 1 and 2 allows for further progression of the disease.4,5

To additionally reduce the risk of SFSS in patients with large or multiple liver tumors, associating liver partition and portal vein ligation (PVL) for staged hepatectomy ([ALPPS] the combination of PVL with parenchymal transection) has been showcased as a procedure that induces accelerated liver regeneration and greatly reduces the interval between steps, allowing treatment of patients otherwise deemed unresectable.6,7

This procedure, introduced about five years ago, has gained sustained acceptance with more than 1,000 cases included in an international registry (http://www.alpps.net/?q=registry).

PARAGRAPH

Although there have been several clinical studies evaluating ALPPS in patients, reports on the molecular mechanisms underlying the regenerative acceleration following ALPPS step 1 remain scarce.

Several components known to be necessary for liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy have likewise been associated with accelerated regeneration.

In rodent models, IL-6 and TNFα – established mediators of liver regeneration – have been found upregulated in ALPPS at the mRNA and protein level.

Similarly, protein expression of STAT3, RELA, and YAP1 – known transcription factors in the regenerating liver - were elevated after ALPPS step 1.8,9

Furthermore, hypoxia has recently been shown to be an important driver of normal regeneration through HIF2α, with preliminary studies pointing to the importance of hypoxia in ALPPS as well.10,11

In human ALPPS tissues, IL6 and TNF have been validated on the mRNA level.12

However, none of these molecules seem to be unique to the ALPPS-induced acceleration of regeneration.

PARAGRAPH

We have developed a mouse model of ALPPS and documented the release of serum factors that can accelerate regeneration in mice following PVL to levels seen after the complete ALPPS step 1 procedure.12

These findings suggest that humoral factors must play essential roles in the early instigation of accelerated regeneration.

With this mouse model, we established that the secretion of Indian Hedgehog (IHH) from hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) was necessary for the early activation and progression of accelerated regeneration.13

Although hedgehog signaling has previously been reported to be required for regeneration after hepatectomy, the early elevations in serum IHH were unique to ALPPS, and not observed following hepatectomy or other surgeries.13

PARAGRAPH

Hedgehog activity is barely detectable in healthy adult liver.

Upon hepatectomy, however, hepatocytes begin to proliferate, and HSCs undergo differentiation into myofibroblastic and fibrogenic states.14,15

Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that morphogenic signals – such as the hedgehog pathway – are mediators of the myofibroblastic HSC switch.

When blocking or knocking out Smo, the receptor for hedgehog ligands, HSCs do not acquire myofibroblastic traits, and subsequent hepatocyte regeneration is inhibited.16–18

PARAGRAPH

Given the specific secretion of IHH after ALPPS, this study sought to identify upstream regulators of the ligand to establish the role of IHH in ALPPS.

Expanding on the networks that act to accelerate regeneration after ALPPS may provide insight into new therapeutics for the pharmacological promotion of regeneration in clinical settings.

Animals

PARAGRAPH

All animal experiments were performed in accordance with Swiss Federal Animal Regulations and approved by the Veterinary Office of Zurich.

Male C57Bl/6 mice purchased from Envigo (Horst, NL) age 10–12 weeks were kept on a 12 h day/night cycle with free access to standard chow and water.

Littermates (n = 5) were housed in ventilated cages with automated ambient regulation at room temperature with an environment enriched with paper and bedding for nesting.

N = 5 mice were used per timepoint and treatment group.

SECTION

Animal surgery and treatment

PARAGRAPH

To mimic human ALPPS surgery in mice, 90% PVL was performed leaving a 10% functional remnant consisting of the left and a part of the right middle lobe.

Then, a partial 80% transection was done through the middle lobe along the demarcation line of the occluded/non-occluded parenchyma.

The left lateral lobe ([LLL] 25% of liver volume) was also resected to simulate the cleaning of the liver from smaller tumors as often done in human ALPPS.

Details on isoflurane anesthesia, buprenorphine analgesia, ALPPS procedures, and the control operations (90% PVL, 80% transection, and sham laparotomy) have been described.12,13

Survival for all procedures has been reported to be >90%,12 with similar injury levels for ALPPS and PVL (Fig. S1).

After surgery, animals were allowed to recover on a warming pad in a separate cage until completely conscious.

Animals were weighed before surgery and at sacrifice, where weight of resected and remnant liver was recorded.

Tissue was formalin fixed or snap frozen, while plasma was stored at −80 °C for analysis.

PARAGRAPH

SP600125 (0.016 mg/gram BW, InVivoGen, tlrl-sp60 Toulouse, FR), a specific c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1) inhibitor, or DMSO in oil was injected I.P. 1 h before operation.

Early upregulation of JNK1 in accelerated liver regeneration

PARAGRAPH

To identify potential upstream regulators of the IHH pathway in accelerated liver regeneration we conducted an in silico analysis of our RNA sequencing data sets derived from livers at early timepoints after ALPPS, PVL, transection, or sham surgery.13

Genes that discriminated ALPPS liver from other surgeries were included.

Using string.db.org, Mapk8 was text-mined to be linked to Ihh and Ccnd1 of the hedgehog pathway (Fig. 1A).

Our RNA seq data suggested Mapk8 upregulation at early times after ALPPS, which we confirmed by quantitative PCR in a new set of animals subjected to the different surgeries (Fig. 1B).

Mapk9 and Mapk10 did not show any ALPPS-specific alterations (Fig. S1).

The deregulation of JNK1 was further confirmed on the protein level.

pJNK1, the active form of JNK phosphorylated on Thr183 and Tyr185, was upregulated as early as 1 h after ALPPS (Fig. 1C).

Therefore, JNK1 activation through ALPPS surgery precedes the serum IHH peak that we have previously observed at 4 h post operation.13

From these findings, we hypothesized that JNK1 plays a part in accelerated liver regeneration as a potential instigator of IHH signaling.

SECTION

Ihh and JNK1 are present in activated non-parenchymal cells

PARAGRAPH

To establish an association between JNK1 and IHH signaling, we stained liver sections 4 h after operation (ALPPS, PVL, transection, and sham) for IHH, alpha-smooth muscle actin ([αSMA] a marker of activated HSCs),20,21 and pJNK1.

Non-parenchymal cells were positive for all the three proteins across samples (Fig. S2), suggesting pJNK1 and IHH may interact in stellate cells to accelerate regeneration.

To assess localization of IHH and pJNK1 in activated HSCs, we applied immunofluorescence (Fig. 2A, Fig. S3) to paraffin-embedded liver sections after operation.

pJNK1 co-localized with both αSMA and IHH, indicating their simultaneous presence in activated stellate cells.

Furthermore, pJNK1 and IHH co-localization remained stable over time (Fig. S4).

PARAGRAPH

To substantiate an JNK-IHH association, we prepared cytosolic and nuclear fractions from liver at 4 h and 24 h post-surgery and assessed protein levels of pJNK1, the IHH downstream effector and transcription factor GLI1, and its proliferative target CCND1.13

Indeed, the nuclear increases in pJNK were paralleled by increases in GLI1, while nuclear levels of total JNK1 and GLI2 remained unchanged (Fig. S5).

CCND1 was significantly elevated at 24 h in nuclear fractions (Fig. 2C), fitting its delayed induction seen on immunoblots 8 h after ALPPS as previously reported.13

Conversely, a non-significant elevation in CCND1-positive hepatocyte nuclei was noted on immunohistochemistry at 4 h post ALPPS, and was accompanied with increases in proliferative marker (Ki67, bold pH319) counts.

Likewise, the elevated nuclear CCND1 positivity correlated with Ki67/bold pH3 increases at 24 h post ALPPS (Fig. 2C, Fig. S6).

PARAGRAPH

These findings associate JNK1 activation with both the induction of IHH signaling and the promotion of proliferation following ALPPS.

Therefore, JNK1 may foster regeneration in ALPPS by causing release of IHH from stellate cells to induce paracrine proliferation of hepatocytes via GLI1-CCND1.13,22–26

SECTION

Reduction of JNK1 activity in ALPPS-treated mice abolishes regenerative acceleration

PARAGRAPH

If the elevated activity of JNK1 after ALPPS is promoting acceleration of regeneration, inhibiting JNK should reduce the ALPPS effects.

To decrease JNK1 activity, we chose SP600125, a specific JNK inhibitor that has been widely used in liver regeneration studies because of its specificity and ease of application.27,28

SP600125 was injected 1 h prior to ALPPS surgery, and the assessment of pJNK1 levels in nuclear fractions confirmed a partial inhibition of the protein, with pJNK1 declining to levels seen in mice 4 h after PVL (Fig. 3A, Fig. S7).

PARAGRAPH

DMSO vehicle injections had no significant impact on body and liver weight after ALPPS, although DMSO seemed to reduce the ALPPS effects slightly.

In contrast, SP600125 significantly reduced the FLR/BW down to levels seen after PVL (Fig. 3B).

Congruent changes were observed for the proliferative markers Ki67 and pH3 in SP600125-treated animals (Fig. 3C, Fig. S8).

We conclude that partial JNK1 inhibition prior to ALPPS surgery reduces the regenerative speed to levels comparable to those after PVL.

Therefore, JNK1 is an important instigator of the ALPPS-specific acceleration of liver regeneration.

SECTION

The inhibition of JNK1 downregulates the IHH-GLI1-CCND1 axis in hedgehog signaling

PARAGRAPH

To determine whether JNK1 may act through IHH signaling, we assessed the IHH pathway components in ALPPS mice treated with SP600125 or control DMSO injection.

PARAGRAPH

Following ALPPS, IHH protein levels peak in serum at 4 h with little change in the liver, consistent with the secretion of the ligand from stellate cells.

The increases in serum IHH then promote GLI1 nuclear translocation, downregulation of the hedgehog inhibitor (hedgehog interacting protein or HHIP), and CCND1 upregulation from 4 h onwards after ALPPS.13

Treatment with SP600125 reduced both serum and hepatic levels of IHH 4 h post ALPPS (Fig. 4A), suggesting JNK1 inhibits production and/or release of the hedgehog ligand.

Consistent with IHH downregulation, Gli1 expression was decreased at 4 h and 24 h (Fig. 4B), while Hhip expression was increased by SP600125 treatment at 4 h after ALPPS (Fig. 4C).

Likewise, GLI1 protein and its target CCND1 were downregulated in nuclear fractions of ALPPS liver at 4 h and 24 h compared to vehicle controls (Fig. 4C).

Immunohistochemistry confirmed the reductions in nuclear GLI1 and CCND1 (Fig. 4E–F, Fig. S11) with SP600125 treatment.

No significant expression changes were observed for Ptch1, Smo, Gli2 (Fig. S9) and nuclear GLI2 (Fig. S10), all molecules the expression of which does not change following IHH stimulation in ALPPS.13

These findings identify IHH signaling as a potential mediator of JNK1’s ability to accelerate regeneration in ALPPS.

SECTION

Recombinant IHH rescues ALPPS-induced regeneration after JNK inhibition

PARAGRAPH

If JNK1 is promoting its accelerating effects through IHH signaling, restoring IHH levels in SP600125-treated liver should re-accelerate the regenerative response after ALPPS surgery.

PARAGRAPH

Mice were pretreated with SP600125, ALPPS-operated, injected with recombinant ligand (rIHH), and compared to vehicle (DMSO & PBS)-treated ALPPS controls.

When assessing body weight after all treatments, no differences were observed between the groups.

In contrast, the FLR/BW was significantly elevated after ALPPS+SP6+rIHH compared to ALPPS+SP6 (Fig. 5A).

Notably, DMSO/PBS injection on its own seemed to have some negative impact on ALPPS regeneration.

Nonetheless, liver weight was statistically similar for the ALPPS+DMSO+PBS and the ALPPS+SP6+rIHH groups (Fig. 5A).

Likewise, congruent changes were observed for the proliferative markers Ki67 and pH3 (Fig. 5B, Fig. S12).

Therefore, rIHH can compensate for the inhibition of JNK1 during ALPPS-associated regeneration.

SECTION

Recombinant IHH re-instates hedgehog signaling and promotes JNK1 activity in SP600125-treated ALPPS liver

PARAGRAPH

To further elucidate the relationship between JNK1 and IHH in ALPPS, we evaluated the levels of the individual pathway components.

In SP600125-ALPPS-treated mice, rIHH increased Gli1 and decreased Hhip expression (Fig. 6A), as well as promoted nuclear GLI1 and CCND1 on immunoblots and immunochemistry (Fig. 6B–D, Fig. S13).

Again, Ptch, Smo, Gli2 mRNA levels (Fig. S14), and GLI2 protein levels (Fig. S15) were not affected significantly or in a meaningful way.

Intriguingly, when assessing JNK1, rIHH also increased the levels of nuclear JNK1 (Fig. S14) and of nuclear pJNK1 on both immunoblots (Fig. 6E) and immunohistochemistry (Figs. S16 and 17).

Therefore, IHH can increase the activity of JNK1 in ALPPS liver with partially inhibited JNK1, suggesting the presence of a positive feedback loop between JNK1 and IHH.

To support this view, we performed pJNK1 immunofluorescence on liver from mice that were subjected to PVL only and co-injected with either PBS or rIHH.

The latter accelerates regeneration of PVL mice to ALPPS levels, as we have previously shown.13

Again, rIHH treatment promoted non-parenchymal pJNK1 expression relative to PBS controls (Fig. S18), providing further evidence for a feed forward relation between IHH and JNK1.

PARAGRAPH

Altogether, these findings establish IHH as a downstream effector of JNK1 in the acceleration of regeneration after ALPPS surgery.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Liver regeneration is a complex molecular response unique in its ability to restore full function to the organ.29

Many pathways have been identified to participate, such as signaling through the hedgehog pathway.18,28

Nevertheless, liver regeneration does not occur in all patient scenarios, as liver failure ensues if the loss of functional tissue is too extensive.4

With the introduction of ALPPS, the regenerative capacity has been extended and is expected to improve outcomes of two-staged hepatectomies in patients with marginal qualifications for resection.

The unprecedented effect of ALPPS on liver recovery has provoked strong interest in the mechanisms underlying the acceleration of liver regeneration.

PARAGRAPH

Herein, we demonstrate a hitherto undescribed interaction between JNK1 and IHH in stellate cells that acts to instigate accelerated liver regeneration early after ALPPS step 1 surgery.

More specifically, we demonstrate that (i) JNK1 activation is associated with liver weight gain and precedes the upregulation of IHH-GLI1-CCND1 signaling, (ii) partial inhibition of JNK1 reduces the rate of regeneration to that seen after PVL alone, along with congruent decreases in the IHH-GLI1-CCND1 axis, and that (iii) recombinant IHH is sufficient to restore ALPPS regeneration in JNK1-inhibited mice.

PARAGRAPH

The alterations we observed following ALPPS, SP600125, and rIHH treatments were consistently reflected in GLI1-CCND1 nuclear levels and were strongly correlated with changes in proliferative markers as well as liver weight changes.

Conversely, molecules of the hedgehog pathway that were not affected through IHH (i.e. Ptch, Smo, GLI2) were also not meaningfully altered through JNK1 manipulation.

Moreover, the changes in these hedgehog components were examined via PCR, Western blots as well as immunohistochemical approaches.

Therefore, we can reliably conclude that JNK1 initiates the IHH-GLI1-CCND1 axis in accelerated regeneration.

PARAGRAPH

As a limitation to this study, pharmaceutical inhibition was employed to inhibit JNK1 activity during our ALPPS experiments.

Genetic knockout models may provide more clear-cut evidence; however, we decided for a pharmacological approach to reduce rather than block JNK activity, given the presence of low levels of pJNK1 also after PVL, the main ALPPS control surgery.

Knockdown strategies may be an alternative, however SP600125 has been widely used in liver research including regeneration studies,22,23,26,28,33 rendering our study comparable to existing work on hepatic JNK.

PARAGRAPH

JNK1’s role after partial hepatectomy has been revealed by the observation that its inhibition blocks hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration.18,28,30

JNK1 is activated within 1 h after partial hepatectomy, leading to AP-1 activation, the promotion of cyclin D1 expression, and hepatocellular G0-G1 transition.22,30,31

Interestingly, through studies in fibrosis, JNK1 was found to be involved in HSC activation, where it promotes αSMA expression and HSC proliferation.22,33

The morphogenic hedgehog network likewise is recognized to be essential to liver regeneration and to promote expansion of activated HSCs.13,15,18,34

However, whether JNK1 interacts with the hedgehog pathway after partial hepatectomy is unknown.

PARAGRAPH

Similar to regeneration after partial hepatectomy, we observed JNK1 upregulation 1 h after ALPPS.

JNK1 primarily localized to activated HSCs after ALPPS.

Although immunohistochemistry also revealed hepatocellular expression, the staining did not detect cytoplasmic expression (i.e. contrary to the immunoblots) and was difficult to reproduce.

In contrast, immunofluorescence consistently localized pJNK1 to HSCs at various times after surgeries, while little, if any, expression was detected in hepatocytes.

We therefore propose that JNK1 activity in HSCs is crucial for the regenerative response induced by ALPPS.

The co-localization of IHH and JNK1 in activated HSCs suggested a novel link between these two molecules, which we could demonstrate through SP600125 and recombinant IHH.

Indeed, studies in skin cancer have revealed a link between JNK1 and the hedgehog pathway; there, JUN (the canonical JNK1 target) required synergistic interaction with GLI1 for full activation of downstream molecules.35

Therefore, complex interactions appear to exist between JNK1 and hedgehog signaling.

PARAGRAPH

Unlike after partial hepatectomy, ALPPS did not appear to increase the number of αSMA-positive cells, suggesting JNK1 activity does not promote HSC activation in these settings.

While JNK1 clearly promotes regeneration after hepatectomy and ALPPS, the associated mechanisms seem to differ in some aspects.

Likewise, JNK1 has been localized to non-parenchymal, parenchymal, but also infiltrating cells after hepatectomy31,32 while we could observe consistent expression only in non-parenchymal cells.

Moreover, the interaction between JNK1 and IHH is key in instigating accelerated regeneration after ALPPS.

The extent to which IHH participates in regeneration after hepatectomy is unknown; however, the early, strong IHH secretion is unique after ALPPS, as plasma IHH increases occur at much later times and only at modest levels after resection.13,18

Conversely, we observed a statistically significant elevation of serum sonic hedgehog (SHH) at 4 h after partial hepatectomy relative to ALPPS,13 suggesting SHH rather than IHH may be the hedgehog ligand relevant after resection.

However, whether JNK1 is interacting with SHH after hepatectomy remains unknown.

In mice, hepatectomy leads to little parenchymal injury, whereas in ALPPS, liver injury through parenchymal transection is preceded by ligation, which on its own induces regeneration through mechanisms that are ill-defined.

Therefore, the divergent nature of the initial regenerative stimuli may underlie the timing and the set of interacting proteins/pathways that define the speed of regeneration after a given surgery.

PARAGRAPH

In this regard, an intriguing observation is that recombinant IHH not only restored accelerated regeneration in SP600125-treated mice, but in parallel increased the activity of the partially inhibited JNK1 – as it did in IHH-treated PVL mice.

These findings imply IHH enhances JNK1 activities in retrograde to promote its own secretion.

While further evidence is required to establish such mechanisms, a positive feedback loop between JNK1 and IHH would provide an attractive explanation for the enhanced IHH secretion and the regenerative acceleration unique to ALPPS.

PARAGRAPH

We have previously demonstrated that injection of rIHH is sufficient to induce ALPPS-like regeneration in mice subjected to PVL only.13

Therefore, recombinant/pharmacological promotion of the JNK1-IHH axis may bear therapeutic potential.

Injection of rIHH seems particularly attractive, as it mimics the ALPPS-induced serum elevations, and because of its downstream position that might be associated with less unwanted effects.

PARAGRAPH

However, chronic activation of JNK1 or IHH has been associated with the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).36,37

Consistent JNK1 activity has been reported to predict a bad outcome in HCC, an aspect that perhaps relates to JNK1 activation secondary to chronic liver injury, an accepted cause of HCC.

Although the pro-apoptotic function of JNK1 has been related to anti-cancerous actions,38 recent evidence indicates a more complex situation, as JNK1 may directly promote the repair of DNA breaks.36

These observations suggest a disturbed balance between the removal or repair of damaged hepatocytes that underlies JNK1’s association with a bad HCC outcome.36

Indeed, a dual role of JNK1 in HCC has been postulated through animal models, where either its loss or its overactivation contribute to the development of malignancy.22

Similarly, chronic hedgehog signaling has been linked to HCC.

High levels of hedgehog components in HCC seem to maintain the proliferation of cancer stem cells, thereby contributing to HCC progression.38

Likewise, liver diseases associated with chronic injury and an elevated HCC risk (i.e. non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) are accompanied by a chronic overactivation of the hedgehog pathway.37

On the other hand, JNK1 and hedgehog activities remain associated with the successful healing of tissue injury, consistent with the view that transient activity of these molecules may be beneficial for the liver.16,18,28,31,37,39

PARAGRAPH

The first cases of ALPPS occurred in patients in Germany where the technique to induce accelerated regeneration of the liver was discovered by chance.6,7

By combination of PVL and transection, extensive tumor resection was performed and patient recovery occurred in record time.40–43

The understanding of ALPPS-triggered processes is in its infancy; however, underlying mechanisms begin to emerge, with the JNK1-IHH axis a first example of ALPPS-specific molecular events that can be associated with the unprecedented regenerative acceleration.

Short-term activation of JNK1 and IHH might be of use in the clinic.

Not every patient requiring ALPPS may qualify for this major surgery; for example, highly morbid patients that may tolerate PVL, but not the more invasive ALPPS, may benefit from a JNK1-IHH-based promotion of regeneration.

Although the oncological risks associated with long-term activation will not vanish, the prevention of imminent death by liver failure may justify the use of compounds activating the JNK1-IHH pathway.

Understanding the extent to which the JNK1 and IHH signals can be stimulated may open the opportunity for pharmacological administration to encourage regeneration in at-risk-patients, eventually expanding the boundaries of success in the treatment of liver disease one step further.
