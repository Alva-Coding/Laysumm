TITLE

Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct: Assessment of invasive carcinoma and long-term outcomes using MRI

PARAGRAPH

Significant magnetic resonance imaging findings that differentiated between an intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB) with an associated invasive carcinoma and an IPNB with intraepithelial neoplasia were intraductal visible mass, tumor size ≥2.5 cm, multiplicity of the tumor, bile duct wall thickening, and adjacent organ invasion.

Significant magnetic resonance imaging findings of invasive IPNB have a negative impact on recurrence-free survival.
