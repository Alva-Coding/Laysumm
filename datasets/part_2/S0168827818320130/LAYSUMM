TITLE

HCV modifies EGF signalling and upregulates production of CXCR2 ligands: Role in inflammation and antiviral immune response

PARAGRAPH

In most cases hepatitis C virus (HCV) results in chronic infection and persistent viral replication, taking decades until development of overt disease.

To achieve such a course, the respective virus must have developed mechanisms to circumvent antiviral response, to modulate the inflammatory response and to utilise the infrastructure of its host with moderate effect on its viability.

The present study provides novel data indicating that HCV induces epidermal growth factor production in its host cell, enhancing epidermal growth factor-inducible expression of chemokines that bind to the CXCR2 receptor and recruit neutrophile granulocytes.

Importantly, chemokines are critical mediators determining the pattern of immune cells recruited to the site of injury and thereby the local inflammatory and immunological milieu.

These data strongly suggest that HCV triggers mechanisms that enable the virus to influence the inflammatory and immunological processes of its host.
