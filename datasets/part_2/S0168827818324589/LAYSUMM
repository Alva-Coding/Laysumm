TITLE

NK-cell responses are biased towards CD16-mediated effector functions in chronic hepatitis B virus infection

PARAGRAPH

In chronic hepatitis B virus infection, natural killer (NK)-cell phenotype and function is altered.

In this study, we demonstrate that these changes are linked to the emergence of a distinct NK-cell subset, namely memory-like NK cells.

The emergence of these memory-like NK cells is associated with coinfection of human cytomegalovirus that affects the majority of patients with chronic hepatitis B.
