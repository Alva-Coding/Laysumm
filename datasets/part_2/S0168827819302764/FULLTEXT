TITLE

Fetal origin confers radioresistance on liver macrophages via p21cip1/WAF1

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Kupffer cells (KCs), the liver-resident macrophages, are important innate immune sensors that respond to liver stress, and may either stimulate or suppress immunity.1

In contrast to most other leukocytes, tissue-resident macrophages in the brain (microglia) and epidermis (Langerhans cells) are highly radioresistant.2,3

However, in the liver, only a subset of KCs resists lethal irradiation, while the other subset is replaced by donor bone-marrow-monocyte-derived KCs (bm-KCs).4,5

This radioresistant KC subset is long lived, and they are not recruited to foci of inflammation, and thus, are termed sessile KCs.4,6

Gene expression and epigenetic chromatin modification analysis have confirmed that bm-KCs become broadly similar to sessile KC post-recovery, but not identical.5,7

While the sessile KC subset is identified post-irradiation, the identity of this subset in unmanipulated mice and why only a subset of KCs resists irradiation are not yet understood.

PARAGRAPH

Kupffer cells traditionally comprise all of the fully mature macrophages in the steady-state liver, identified by F4/80 staining in the mouse.

A developing consensus asserts that KCs are a single population of long-lived cells that are seeded from embryonic precursors, and that any other macrophages found in the liver are transient, better-termed “liver macrophages.”

In favor of this view, several lineage-tracing experiments concluded that all liver-resident macrophages are embryo derived.8–12

Conversely, other evidence favors the concept that long-lived KCs are heterogeneous, with some derived from blood monocytes.

On adoptive transfer into neonates, blood monocytes integrated into the KC niche, indicating that the liver macrophage compartment remained open.13

Resident fractalkine receptor-1 (Cx3cr1)-hiF4/80+ subcapsular macrophages are continuously replenished by blood monocytes in the steady-state liver, further supporting the presence of bm-KCs in normal adult liver.14

A single-cell transcriptome analysis reports two distinct KC clusters based on gene expression Marco, Clec4f, Clec1b versus Clec4e, Clec4d subsets.15

While the relationships between subsets identified in these studies are yet to be resolved, a strong case can be made that the liver contains at least two subsets of macrophages: yolk-sac (YS) embryo-derived versus monocyte-derived cells.

In this study, we explored the identity of the sessile KC subset in relation to ontogeny, evaluating their embryo versus monocyte origin and potential mechanisms of radioresistance.

PARAGRAPH

Using a combination of fate mapping, radiation chimeras, KC depletion, and in situ translatome analysis via the RiboTag mice, we identified the radioresistant sessile KC subset as an embryo-derived, postnatally Cx3cr1-marked F4/80-hi KC subset, and showed that these cells strongly upregulated the Cdkn1a gene upon irradiation, and that in the absence of this gene their radioresistance was lost.

In contrast, the bm-KC subset was sensitive to irradiation.

At the gene expression level, the sessile KCs and the bm-KCs resembled each other, but were not identical, suggesting that these may be functionally distinct subsets.

Results

SECTION

RiboTag reporter mice allow in situ gene expression analysis of KCs

PARAGRAPH

Current knowledge of gene expression in KCs is based on the analysis of cells isolated using FACS methods, defining them as the F4/80-hi and CD11b+ subset within the CD45+ leukocyte population.

The efficiency of cell isolation and the purity of KCs are based on the techniques and the surface markers used,18 emphasizing the difficulty of basing the analysis of KCs exclusively on cells isolated using tissue dissociation.4,5

PARAGRAPH

We adopted a strategy first described in neurons16 to bypass the cell isolation problem and to analyze gene expression via cell-specific activation of the RiboTag reporter followed by polysome immunoprecipitation (RiboIP) (Fig. 1A).

To validate the RiboTag approach in KCs, we used Emr1Cre, a Cre driver that uses the promoter from the F4/80 antigen gene.19

We generated Emr1Cre+/−::RiboTag+/− mice, and measured RNAs encoding 140 genes (Fig. 1B; Fig. S2).

Tissue-resident macrophage genes identified by the ImmGen consortium20 (Emr1, MerTK, and CD64) showed over 10-fold enrichment, while the KC-specific gene Clec4f7 and the phagocytosis gene Marco were over 50-fold enriched compared to total liver RNA.

Phagocytosis genes (Vsig4 and Mcr1) and iron-metabolism-related genes (CD163 and Hmox-1) were also strongly enriched mirroring known functions of steady-state KCs.

The analysis of hepatocyte genes (Alb, Hamp1, and Cyp2f2) and sinusoidal endothelial cell genes (Tie2 and Lyve1) indicated a 10-fold or more de-enrichment, while hepatic stellate cell transcript abundance was low in both input and RiboIP fractions.

Other myeloid cell genes, such as Siglecf, Ccr2, Ly6c, and DEC205, showed only small changes relative to total liver RNA.

Similarly, microglia and cardiac macrophages showed enrichment in tissue macrophage genes (Fig. 1E).

Immunofluorescence staining using anti-HA and anti-F4/80 antibodies revealed RiboTag stained KCs in situ (Fig. 1C).

We used intracellular staining of HA protein visualized by flow cytometry to calculate the recombination efficiency.

KCs were gated as CD45+, CD11b+, Tie2−, Ly6G−, Siglecf−, and F4/80-hi cells in the live single-cell population (Fig. S1).

In Emr1Cre+/−::RiboTag+/− mice, ∼82% of KCs were labeled with RiboTag, while no other cell subset showed labeling (Fig. 1D).

The exclusive labeling of the F4/80-hi cells further confirms the high specificity of Emr1Cre in activating reporters in KCs, as described previously.21

A recent study used RiboTag mice to define the translatome in microglia.22

We here extend the use of RiboTag to KCs.

SECTION

Gene expression in sessile KCs versus bm-KCs

PARAGRAPH

Transcriptomes of sessile KCs versus bm-KCs 8 weeks post-irradiation were defined in KCs isolated using FACS,5 but we set out to compare their translatomes.

We generated radiation bone-marrow chimeras where the Emr1Cre and RiboTag transgenes were localized to either the sessile KCs or the bm-KCs (Fig. 2A).

PARAGRAPH

Immunofluorescence images distinguished the host versus donor-derived KCs based on HA expression 8 weeks post-irradiation (Fig. 2B).

We compared the expression of 94 expressed genes in the two subsets (Fig. 2C; Fig. S4).

Characteristic tissue macrophage genes (Emr1, MerTK, and CD64) and phagocytosis-related genes (Clec4f, Vsig4, and Msr1) were expressed to a similar level in both subsets.

Among the differentially expressed genes, sessile KCs showed a significantly higher expression of the phagocytosis gene Marco, apoptotic cell engulfment gene Timd4, c-lectin family scavenger receptor Colec12, iron homeostasis gene Hmox1, and cell-cycle inhibitor Cdkn1a.

The bm-KCs showed a significantly higher expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II genes (H2-Ab1 and H2-Aa), while the MHC Class I gene (H2-K1) was similar in both subsets.

While these data are consistent with previous findings on differentially expressed genes in sessile KCs versus bm-KCs,5 we did not find the hemoglobin scavenger receptor (CD163) and erythropoietin receptor (Epor) to be different between the two subsets.

This may explain the differences between dissociation and FACS versus in situ mRNA capture, and the differences between transcriptome versus translatome analysis.

A recent study clearly documents the differences in gene expression in microglia in a side-by-side analysis of sorted cell transcriptome versus RiboIP translatomes.22

Overall, we confirmed that sessile KCs and bm-KCs express many macrophage genes similarly, but some very differently.

PARAGRAPH

Since only the sessile KCs were exposed to irradiation, it is plausible that differential gene expression in this subset was due to the radiation, rather than to distinct subsets.

To test this, we compared the gene expression of nonirradiated control mice to sessile KC subset 8 weeks post-irradiation.

In the sessile subset, Marco and Cdkn1a showed radiation-induced changes in gene expression that persisted up to 8 weeks (Fig. 2E).

To determine whether the differential gene expression between sessile KCs versus bm-KCs balanced out over time, we analyzed the gene expression in the sessile KC versus the bm-KC subset 13 weeks post-irradiation.

While the level of Timd4, Colec12, Hmox1, Cdkn1a, H2-Ab1, and H2-Aa expressions became comparable by 13 weeks, Marco expression remained 40-fold higher in sessile KCs compared to the bm-KC subset (Fig. 2F).

Collectively, our results indicate that tissue environment is not the sole driver of gene expression in KCs.

Cx3cr1-based lineage-tracing labels embryo-derived long-lived KCs in the adult liver

PARAGRAPH

While it is clear that a subset of KCs resists irradiation, the origin of this sessile subset in the nonirradiated liver remains unclear.

Thus, we labeled the embryo-derived KCs in adult mice using a fate mapping approach.

PARAGRAPH

We devised a RiboTag reporter and inducible Cre recombinase-based strategy to label embryo-derived KCs immediately after birth.

Cx3cr1-driven tamoxifen-inducible Cre, termed Cx3cr1CreER, is used in tissue macrophage lineage tracing.9,23,24

Developmental studies in embryos indicate that Cx3cr1 is expressed in YS precursors that give rise to tissue macrophages and maintain expression on microglia and a subset of cardiac macrophages into adulthood.23–28

However, in KCs, Cx3cr1 expression ceases after the early postnatal period.9,23

Furthermore, Cx3cr1 is also expressed on a subset of dendritic cells and monocytes; thus, a constitutive Cx3cr1-Cre driver would not have been truly cell-type specific.

PARAGRAPH

Using FACS, we found that, at neonatal Day 2, only 43% of KCs expressed CX3CR1, while monocytes expressed none (Fig. 3B; Fig. S5).

This indicates that, by Day 2, at least 43% of embryo-derived KCs continued to express Cx3cr1, while it is possible that some had already ceased expression.

Furthermore, the absence of CX3CR1+ monocytes suggested that CX3CR1+ monocyte-derived macrophages were not seeding the liver within the first 2 days.

Thus, the first 2 days after birth provide a window to label embryo-derived KCs using the tamoxifen-inducible Cx3Cr1-eyfp-CreER model.

We bred Cx3cr1-eyfp-CreER+/+ mice with RiboTag+/+ mice, and the offspring were tamoxifen induced within the first 2 days of birth (Fig. 3A).

At 8 weeks, we analyzed the liver tissue by immunofluorescence, and showed that only a subset of KCs was labeled with RiboTag (Fig. 3C).

Intracellular FACS staining showed that 37% of the total KCs in the adult mice were RiboTag labeled, hence, were postnatally Cx3cr1 marked, representing the embryo-derived KC subset (Fig. 3D, i and ii).

In contrast, microglia showed ∼80% RiboTag labeling indicating that the labeling efficiency of Cx3cr1-eyfp-CreER promoter was about 80% (Fig. 3D, iv).

FACS analysis further revealed that monocytes or dendritic cells in the adult liver did not carry RiboTag labeling, indicating that any cell that was labeled in the early postnatal period had turned over by 8 weeks (Fig. 3D, ii).

PARAGRAPH

Labeling at 1 and 6 weeks, and analysis at 10 weeks of age showed labeling reduced to only 2% and <1%, respectively (Fig. 3D, v), providing further evidence that the Cx3cr1 expression ceased on embryo-derived KCs early in development, and that the Cx3cr1 fate-mapping strategy could be only used to label embryo-derived KCs within the first days after birth.

To determine the turnover of Cx3cr1-marked KCs in the liver, we measured the frequency of HA+ KCs at 2, 3, and 10 weeks and 4, 6, 9, and 12 months post-induction among the total KCs in mice induced on neonatal Day 2.

The Cx3cr1-marked KCs maintained a 37% frequency among total KCs up to 9 months before declining to 22% by 12 months (Fig. 3E), showing their stability over time.

This observation is consistent with a previous report that postnatally labeled KCs survived up to 9 months;23 however, our data suggest these were more abundant than the previously reported 7%.

PARAGRAPH

Next, we examined gene expression in the Cx3cr1-marked KCs, and showed that consensus tissue macrophage genes (Emr1, MerTK, and CD64) and KC-related genes (Marco and Clec4f) were highly enriched, while hepatocyte, sinusoidal endothelial cells, hepatic stellate cells, and other myeloid markers were either de-enriched or showed no change (Fig. 3F; Fig. S2).

Taken together, these data show that Cx3cr1-eyfp-CreER combined with RiboTag fate mapping allows both labeling and gene expression analysis of Cx3cr1-marked embryo-derived KCs following postnatal tamoxifen induction.

SECTION

Embryo-derived Cx3cr1-marked KCs resist irradiation and express sessile KC genes

PARAGRAPH

To determine whether the Cx3cr1-marked KCs resist lethal irradiation, we generated radiation chimeras in Cx3cr1-marked KC bearing Cx3Cr1-eyfp-CreER+/−::RiboTag+/− mice (Fig. 4A).

Eight weeks post-irradiation immunofluorescence analysis of frozen sections clearly indicated the HA label bearing Cx3cr1-marked KCs that persisted after irradiation (Fig. 4C).

PARAGRAPH

Intracellular FACS analysis indicated that 19% of the host-derived KCs in the irradiated group, and 26% of the KCs in the nonirradiated control group were composed of Cx3cr1-marked KCs (Fig. 4D).

These results indicate that Cx3cr1-marked embryo-derived KCs were relatively radioresistant.

Furthermore, there is a subset of non-labeled host-derived KCs that also resisted irradiation.

It is possible that these represent embryo-derived KCs that did not label after they ceased to express Cx3cr1.

Next, we compared the gene expression of Cx3cr1-marked radioresistant KCs to the sessile KCs, and found that, at the gene expression level, the two subsets closely resembled each other (Fig. 4E).

The genes that showed elevated expressions in the sessile subset (Marco, Timd4, Colec12, and Cdkn1a) compared to the bm-KC subset were equally elevated in the radioresistant Cx3cr1-marked KCs.

These observations demonstrate that the sessile KCs consist of Cx3cr1-marked, embryo-derived, long-lived KCs.

SECTION

Bone-marrow-monocyte-derived KCs are sensitive to lethal irradiation

PARAGRAPH

A subset of Cx3cr1-marked embryo-derived KCs both resists irradiation and resembles sessile KCs in gene expression, but we cannot yet rule out the possibility that the long-lived bm-KCs also resist irradiation.

A KC depletion–repopulation study indicated that the repopulated KCs were long lived and closely resembled the replaced resident KCs,13 so it is possible that these bm-KCs were also able to resist irradiation and formed part of the sessile subset.

Thus, we next explored whether the bm-KCs also resist irradiation.

PARAGRAPH

Clodronate liposomes effectively deplete all KCs.29

Immediately after the administration of Clodronate, all F4/80-hi KCs are lost, and over time, blood monocytes differentiate into F4/80int macrophages that will slowly morph into F4/80-hi KCs.30

To generate a KC compartment solely derived from bone-marrow monocytes harboring the RiboTag reporter, we administered Clodronate into 3-week-old Emr1Cre+/−::RiboTag+/− mice (Fig. 5A).

The time course confirmed that KCs were totally ablated within 48 h, but restored to ∼58% compared to the ∼78% control levels by 6 weeks post-Clodronate (Fig. 5B; Fig. S6).

PARAGRAPH

To exclude the possibility of KC repopulation through local proliferation of progenitors, we administered Clodronate into Cx3cr1-marked KC bearing mice at 3 weeks and analyzed at 6 weeks posttreatment.

Cx3cr1-marked KCs were completely ablated in the Clodronate group, while there was no effect in the control liposome-treated group (Fig. 5C).

This confirmed that, following Clodronate treatment, the repopulation of KCs only occurs from monocyte differentiation, and not from clonal expansion of long-lived resident KCs.

Gene expression analysis 6 weeks posttreatment revealed that both Clodronate and control liposome groups show similar level of expression in a panel of 46 genes (Fig. 5D).

PARAGRAPH

To explore the radiosensitivity of these bm-KCs, we lethally irradiated either the Clodronate or the control liposome-treated Emr1Cre+/−::RiboTag+/− mice 6 weeks after liposome treatment, and reconstituted with WT CD45.1 bone marrow (Fig. 5A).

Eight weeks posttransplant, we analyzed the donor versus host chimerism in blood and liver KCs (Fig. 5E).

Clodronate-treated mice had a significantly lower number of host KCs (<5%) compared to the control liposome-treated mice (∼25%), suggesting that bm-KCs are sensitive to lethal irradiation.

These data clearly indicate that bm-KCs do not contribute significantly to the radioresistant sessile KC subset.

SECTION

Immediate response of Cx3cr1-marked long-lived sessile KCs and bm-KCs to radiation injury

PARAGRAPH

Next, we set to explore the mechanisms that confer this unique radioresistance on the Cx3cr1-marked sessile KC subset.

A recent study indicates that embryo-derived Langerhans cells resist irradiation through a Cdkn1a-mediated pathway, while bone-marrow-derived dermal dendritic cells undergo apoptotic death upon irradiation.31

This could suggest that an embryonic origin confers radioresistance on multiple myeloid lineages.

Thus, we next explored the responses of the two KC subsets to irradiation following 24 h.

PARAGRAPH

First, we assessed radiation-induced damage in Cx3cr1-marked embryo-derived KCs versus repopulated bm-KCs after Clodronate treatment.

Using intracellular staining and FACS, we detected phosphorylated histone variant γ-H2AX protein, a marker of DNA double-strand breaks,32 at 24 h after lethal irradiation.

The two KC subsets showed similar (>2-fold) upregulation of the γ-H2AX protein, indicating that both subsets were equally susceptible to γ-irradiation-induced double-strand breaks (Fig. 6A).

PARAGRAPH

Next, we compared the expression of genes in the two subsets 24 h post-irradiation.

We analyzed the gene expression in 92 genes that were previously implicated in the radiation response, inflammation, macrophage functions, and in cell death versus survival (Fig. 6; Fig. S7).33–35

Both subsets showed a significant upregulation of p53-dependent radiation-induced genes (Phlda3, Mdm2, Sens2, and Cdkn1a), while the antioxidant gene Nrf2 was also elevated.

Cell-cycle progression genes (Cdk1 and Ki67) were downregulated in both groups, indicating cell-cycle arrest (Fig. 6C; Fig. S8).

Interestingly, the Cdkn1a upregulation in Cx3cr1-marked KCs was 2.5 times higher than in bm-KCs (Fig. 6B).

We further confirmed the elevated expression of p21cip-1/WAF1 protein in Cx3cr1-marked KCs by flow cytometry (Fig. 6D).

PARAGRAPH

We hypothesized that the increased upregulation of Cdkn1a provides a survival advantage to the embryo-derived KCs.

To test this hypothesis, we generated radiation chimeras in Cdkn1a−/− mice and WT mice.

Eight weeks post-lethal irradiation and congenic bone-marrow transfer, we analyzed the abundance of sessile KCs in each group of chimeras (Fig. 6E).

This experiment revealed that the Cdkn1a−/− group had two-thirds fewer sessile KCs compared to the control group.

Overall, these experiments confirmed that elevated upregulation of the Cdkn1a gene and its protein product, p21cip1/WAF1, in Cx3cr1-marked KCs results in improved survival of radiation-induced damage.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Here, we investigated the identity of sessile KCs and their mechanism of radioresistance.

These cells corresponded to a postnatally Cx3cr1-marked embryo-derived subset.

In contrast to bm-KCs, the Cx3cr1-marked subset showed a greater increase in Cdkn1a mRNA and p21cip1/WAF1 protein following irradiation.

In the absence of Cdkn1a, the sessile KCs significantly lost the ability to survive irradiation, indicating that the enhanced upregulation of Cdkn1a provided greater survival potential to the Cx3cr1-marked subset.

PARAGRAPH

Our postnatal labeling strategy consistently labeled at least a subset (∼37%) of the YS-derived KCs based on their continued expression of Cx3cr1.

While YS-derived KCs are products of erythromyeloid progenitors (EMPs), the bm-KCs are products of hematopoietic-stem-cell (HSC)-derived monocytes.

This suggests that the KCs that originated from HSCs are predisposed to radiation-induced death, while radioresistance is a feature of YS EMP-derived KCs.

While a recent report that concluded YS-derived KCs are partially ablated in response to irradiation,5 we argue that, nevertheless, these cells are relatively radioresistant compared to bm-KCs.

While our study does not directly identify these early HSC-derived long-lived KCs, radiation experiments strongly suggest the existence of a YS-derived and an HSC-derived KC subset.

This conclusion may be more general, since microglia that are solely derived from YS EMPs are also radioresistant.

PARAGRAPH

The p21-cip1/WAF1 protein is a p53-induced molecule that exerts G1 cell-cycle arrest in the context of radiation damage, which may lead to cellular senescence or apoptosis.36,37

However, p21-cip1/WAF1 expression may also be regulated by p53-independent mechanisms, and in this context, it is involved in promoting cell survival.33,38–40

In our study, the upregulation of p21-cip1/WAF1 in both subsets within 24 h of irradiation conforms to the well-known p53-dependent radiation response.

However, it is possible that the 2.5 times higher level of Cdkn1a gene expression in the Cx3cr1-marked subset compared to bm-KCs is due to p53-independent pathways, and this elevation confers radioresistance on the Cx3cr1-marked subset.

While Cdkn1a expression decreased by 1 week post-irradiation in Cx3Cr1-marked KCs, it remained significantly high in the sessile subset compared to nonirradiated controls for at least 8 weeks post-irradiation, further suggesting a pro-survival role for p21-cip1/WAF1 in this subset (Fig. S8).

PARAGRAPH

Expression of the Marco gene remained 40-fold higher out to at least 13 weeks in the sessile subset compared to bm-KCs.

Interestingly, when resident KCs were completely depleted, the repopulating bm-KCs showed a similar level of Marco expression to the resident KCs.

One possible explanation is that the bm-KCs assume distinct transcriptional patterns during repopulation of a completely versus a partially empty niche.

This suggests the existence of two distinct niches, where one is occupied by the sessile KCs and the other by bm-KCs.

It is interesting that clodronate depletion creates short-lived gaps in the sinusoidal layer, suggesting that a subset of KCs may be integrated into the endothelium.41

Based on the restoration of Marco gene expression in bm-KCs post-clodronate, we suggest a model, in which YS-derived KCs occupy these intra-endothelial niches early in ontogeny, which directs their distinctive gene expression, including high Marco expression.

In emergency repopulation after irradiation, these niches remain occupied by YS-derived sessile KCs, but after total KC depletion, the niches are occupied by bm-KCs, which adopt some of the properties of the former occupants.

PARAGRAPH

Human livers also contain a subset of long-lived sessile KCs that persists after transplantation,42 but the origin of these cells is unknown.

The single-cell transcriptome analysis of human liver indicates two distinct subsets of macrophages based on MARCO expression, and gene expression suggests that they have pro-inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory functions.43

Whether the Marcohi sessile KCs are equivalent to the MARCO+ human KCs is yet to be determined.
