ABSTRACT

TITLE

Fetal origin confers radioresistance on liver macrophages via p21cip1/WAF1

PARAGRAPH

Cells of hematopoietic origin, including macrophages, are generally radiation sensitive, but a subset of Kupffer cells (KCs) is relatively radioresistant.

Here, we focused on the identity of the radioresistant KCs in unmanipulated mice and the mechanism of radioresistance.

PARAGRAPH

We employed Emr1- and inducible CX3Cr1-based fate-mapping strategies combined with the RiboTag reporter to identify the total KCs and the embryo-derived KCs, respectively.

The KC compartment was reconstituted with adult bone-marrow-derived KCs (bm-KCs) using clodronate depletion.

Mice were lethally irradiated and transplanted with donor bone marrow, and the radioresistance of bone-marrow- or embryo-derived KCs was studied.

Gene expression was analyzed using in situ mRNA isolation via RiboTag reporter mice, and the translatomes were compared among subsets.

PARAGRAPH

Here, we identified the radioresistant KCs as the long-lived subset that is derived from CX3CR1-expressing progenitor cells in fetal life, while adult bm-KCs do not resist irradiation.

While both subsets upregulated the Cdkn1a gene, encoding p21-cip1/WAF1 protein, radioresistant embryo-derived KCs showed a greater increase in response to irradiation.

In the absence of this molecule, the radioresistance of KCs was compromised.

Replacement KCs, derived from adult hematopoietic stem cells, differed from radioresistant KCs in their expression of genes related to immunity and phagocytosis.

PARAGRAPH

Here, we show that, in the murine liver, a subset of KCs of embryonic origin resists lethal irradiation through Cdkn1a upregulation and is maintained for a long period, while bm-KCs do not survive lethal irradiation.
