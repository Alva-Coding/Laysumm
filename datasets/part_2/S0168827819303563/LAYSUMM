TITLE

Early initiation of antiviral therapy contributes to a rapid and significant loss of serum HBsAg in infantile-onset hepatitis B

PARAGRAPH

Chronicity is a serious threat to infants infected with hepatitis B. However, no treatment measure has been recommended for infantile-onset hepatitis B in current guidelines.

In order to evaluate the benefit and safety of antiviral therapy in infantile-onset hepatitis B, a real-world cohort study was conducted.

Long-term follow-up results showed that early initiation of antiviral therapy with lamivudine safely led to a rapid and significant loss of serum hepatitis B surface antigen in the present subset of infants with alanine aminotransferase ≥2× upper limit of normal.

Further trials with larger cohorts are needed.
