TITLE

Glycolytic activation of peritumoral monocytes fosters immune privilege via the PFKFB3-PD-L1 axis in human hepatocellular carcinoma

PARAGRAPH

Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressed on antigen-presenting cells, rather than tumor cells, has been reported to play an essential role in checkpoint blockade therapy.

A fundamental understanding of mechanisms that regulate the expression of PD-L1 on tumor-infiltrating monocytes/macrophages will undoubtedly lead to the possibility of developing novel PD-L1 blockade strategies with high specificity and efficiency.

The current study unveils a novel mechanism by which metabolic switching links immune activation responses to immune tolerance in the tumor milieu, identifying potential targets for future immune-based anti-cancer therapies.
