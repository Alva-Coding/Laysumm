TITLE

Karnofsky performance status before and after liver transplantation predicts graft and patient survival

PARAGRAPH

The overall health of liver transplant recipients could be assessed by a simple clinical assessment tool called the Karnofsky performance status, which assesses an individual’s overall functional status on an 11-point scale, in increments of 10, where a score of 0 is considered dead and 100 is considered perfect health.

In this study, using a large dataset, we show that the performance status before and after liver transplant is a predictor of survival.

More importantly, those who have low performance status before transplant and do not show an improvement in performance status between 3–12 months after liver transplant have very poor survival.
