TITLE

Liver transplantation in patients with liver failure related to exertional heatstroke

PARAGRAPH

Acute liver injury due to heatstroke can progress to acute liver failure with organ dysfunction despite medical treatment; in such situations, liver transplantation (LT) may offer a therapeutic option.

The classic criteria for LT appear to be poorly adapted to heatstroke-related acute liver failure.

We confirmed that medication is the first-line therapy acute liver injury caused by heatstroke, with LT only rarely necessary.

A decision to perform LT should not be made hastily.

Fluctuations in prothrombin time and the patientâ€™s clinical status should be considered even in the event of severe liver failure.
