TITLE

Normal on-treatment ALT during antiviral treatment is associated with a lower risk of hepatic events in patients with chronic hepatitis B

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) above two times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is one of the key indications for antiviral treatment recommended by international guidelines.1–3

Normal on-treatment ALT is often regarded as a biochemical response to antiviral treatment.

Being one of the most commonly used tests for patients with CHB, ALT level correlates with hepatic necroinflammation.4

The optimal ALT cutoffs are now set at 30 IU/L for men and 19 IU/L for women by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD),3 as high-normal ALT levels according to traditional cutoffs ranging from 40 U/L to 70 U/L are also associated with cirrhosis5 and liver-related mortality.6

PARAGRAPH

Recent studies showed that patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) are more likely to achieve normal on-treatment ALT than those receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) based on AASLD criteria (but not central laboratory criteria), despite a similar rate of viral suppression.7,8

In pooled analyses and individual trials, normal on-treatment ALT rates by AASLD and central laboratory criteria were significantly higher in TAF than TDF recipients at most assessed time points up to 96 weeks.9

Yet the exact underlying mechanisms of this observation remain obscured.

PARAGRAPH

In patients receiving first-line nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) treatment, most of them would have achieved complete viral suppression within 12 months.7,8,10,11

Even so, up to 58% had elevated on-treatment ALT by AASLD criteria at two years.12

Persistently elevated ALT in patients with complete viral suppression may imply the co-existence of fatty liver,13 and was associated with a lower likelihood of cirrhosis regression in patients treated with TDF for five years.10

Nonetheless, whether early normal on-treatment ALT confers better clinical outcomes is yet to be proven, as most studies only considered baseline ALT.

Furthermore, the effect of specific NA on normal on-treatment ALT has not been adequately addressed.

PARAGRAPH

In this real-world territory-wide cohort study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of normal on-treatment ALT at different time points at the first year of ETV and TDF treatment in patients with CHB.

Materials and methods

SECTION

Study design and data source

PARAGRAPH

We performed a retrospective territory-wide cohort study using data from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS) of the Hospital Authority (HA), Hong Kong.

CDARS facilitates the retrieval of clinical data captured from different operational systems for analysis and reporting and provides good quality information to support retrospective clinical and management decisions by integrating the clinical data resided in Data Warehouse.14

It covers all public hospitals and clinics in Hong Kong and represents data of approximately 80% of the local population.15

SECTION

Patients

PARAGRAPH

Patients with CHB who received entecavir (ETV) and/or TDF from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2016 in Hong Kong were identified.

Patients who had incomplete demographic and ALT data; acute hepatitis B; history of liver transplantation; follow-up duration or treatment duration less than 12 months; hepatic events before or during the first year of antiviral treatment; and hepatitis C and/or hepatitis D co-infection based on viral and/or serological markers were excluded (Fig. 1).

Patients were followed until death or last day with dispensed ETV or TDF within six years from the baseline visit.

The study protocol was approved by the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong – New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee.

SECTION

Data collection

PARAGRAPH

Data were retrieved from the CDARS in October 2017.

Baseline date was defined as of the date of the first prescription of ETV or TDF.

Demographic data including gender and date of birth were captured.

At baseline, liver and renal biochemistries, hematological and virologic parameters were collected.

Thereafter, serial liver and renal biochemistries as well as HBV viral markers (HBV surface antigen, anti-HBV surface antibody, HBV DNA) were collected until the last follow-up set on July 31, 2017.

We also retrieved data on other relevant diagnoses, procedures, concomitant drugs, laboratory parameters, dose adjustment in ETV and TDF, and previous exposure to other NA (i.e. lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, or telbivudine) for any duration prior to ETV or TDF use.

Baseline hepatic decompensation was defined by a diagnosis code of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, variceal hemorrhage, or hepatic encephalopathy.16

SECTION

Normal on-treatment ALT

PARAGRAPH

The ULN of ALT was defined accordingly to the AASLD criteria (30 U/L for male and 19 U/L for female),3 as well as the cut-off values defined by the local laboratories (53 U/L for male and 47 U/L for female).

Normal on-treatment ALT in the first year of antiviral treatment at different time points (3, 6, 9, 12 months) was defined as ALT below ULN at the particular time points.

SECTION

Co-existing fatty liver

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) ridge score, a laboratory parameter-based NAFLD prediction score which consisted of six parameters including ALT, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), white blood cell count and the presence of hypertension, was used to detect co-existing NAFLD.

NAFLD ridge score is better to rule out than to rule in the diagnosis of NAFLD.

High cut-off was adopted to include patients with higher positive predictive values for NAFLD.17

SECTION

Events

PARAGRAPH

The primary endpoint in this study was composite hepatic events (including hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]) based on the ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes.

The diagnosis codes were found 99% accurate when referenced to clinical, laboratory, imaging and endoscopy results from the electronic medical records.18

Relevant comorbidities (e.g. cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus), procedures, and laboratory parameters were also retrieved and studied (Table S1).

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Data were analyzed using SAS (9.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

Continuous variables were expressed in mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range), as appropriate, while categorical variables were presented as number (percentage).

Qualitative and quantitative differences between subgroups were analyzed by Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests for categorical parameters and Student’s t test or Mann-Whitney test for continuous parameters, as appropriate.

We determined crude incidence rates (in events/1,000 person-years) with 95% CIs of hepatic events.

Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the cumulative probabilities of hepatic events; log-rank test was used to compare the cumulative probabilities of patients with normal or elevated on-treatment ALT at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.

We used Cox proportional hazards regression analyses to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) (adjusted for baseline ALT level and other relevant covariates) and associated 95% CIs.

The following predefined covariates at baseline were included in the analysis: age, sex, ALT, creatinine, platelet, total bilirubin, albumin, HBV e antigen (HBeAg), antiviral therapy (initiated by ETV or TDF/both), cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus.

Moreover, we assessed whether the association of normal on-treatment ALT and the outcome was modified by antiviral therapy (initiated by ETV or TDF/both), including their pair-wise product term in addition to the individual variables in a Cox regression model.

No significant interaction term was identified.

We also did Schoenfeld’s global test to test the proportional hazards assumption, which did not detect any significant violations.

All statistical tests were two-sided.

Statistical significance was taken as p <0.05.

Results

SECTION

Demographic characteristics

PARAGRAPH

We first identified 46,441 ETV- and/or TDF-treated patients, among whom 21,182 patients with CHB fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in the analysis (Fig. 1).

A total of 10,437 patients achieved normal on-treatment ALT within 12 months of NA treatment according to AASLD criteria; 10,745 did not achieve this biochemical response.

The rate of normal on-treatment ALT at 12 months was lower in patients receiving TDF alone (1,119/2,709, 41.3%) than those receiving ETV alone (9,306/18,447, 50.5%; p <0.001).

PARAGRAPH

The mean age was 51 ± 13 years and the mean follow-up period was 4.0 ± 1.7 years.

Most patients (73.8%) had compensated liver function as demonstrated by normal serum albumin and total bilirubin, and mildly elevated ALT level at the time of starting ETV or TDF.

Patients who had normal on-treatment ALT within 12 months of NA treatment had lower baseline ALT (58 U/L vs. 61 U/L), ALT at 12 months (19 U/L vs. 35 U/L) and HBV DNA levels at baseline (4.9 log10 IU/ml vs. 5.1 log10 IU/ml), and were more likely to be male (76.9% vs. 58.4%), less likely to be HBeAg positive (31.5% vs. 37.1%), cirrhotic (8.8% vs. 10.5%), diabetic (12.6% vs. 15.8%) or have co-existing fatty liver (76.7% vs. 85.6% in 6,086 patients with NAFLD ridge score results) (Table 1).

Among 47.9% with serum HBV DNA results at 12 months, 91.8% and 84.9% had undetectable HBV DNA (<20 IU/ml) in patients with normal and elevated on-treatment ALT, respectively.

SECTION

Normal on-treatment ALT and hepatic events

PARAGRAPH

The primary outcome, i.e. composite hepatic events including HCC, occurred in 627 (3.0%) patients at a mean follow-up of 4.0 ± 1.7 years (Tables 2 and 3; Table S2).

Most of these events were HCC (509; 2.4%).

The crude incidence rates of composite hepatic events (per 1,000 person-years) in patients who had normal vs. elevated on-treatment ALT at different time points were as follows (Table 4): 3 months – 6.5 vs. 7.8; 6 months – 5.6 vs. 8.5; 9 months – 5.6 vs. 8.9; and 12 months – 5.6 vs. 9.2.

Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significant difference in composite hepatic events for normal on-treatment ALT at six months onwards (Fig. 2).

The cumulative incidence of composite endpoint at six years (95% CI) in patients who had normal vs. elevated on-treatment ALT at different time points were as follows: 3 months – 4.27 (3.54–5.15) vs. 4.76 (4.34–5.21; p = 0.083); 6 months – 3.60 (3.07–4.21) vs. 5.24 (4.76–5.77; P <0.001); 9 months – 3.44 (2.98–3.97) vs. 5.57 (5.04–6.16; P <0.001); and 12 months – 3.51 (3.06–4.02) vs. 5.70 (5.15–6.32; P <0.001) (Fig. 2).

PARAGRAPH

Taking patients had elevated on-treatment ALT as reference group, the aHR of composite hepatic events (adjusted for baseline ALT level only) in patients who had normal on-treatment ALT was 0.69 (95% CI 0.56–0.84; p <0.001) at 3 months; 0.62 (0.52–0.74; p <0.001) at 6 months; 0.62 (0.52–0.73; p <0.001) at 9 months; and 0.61 (0.52–0.71; p <0.001) at 12 months.

The aHR (adjusted for baseline ALT level and other relevant covariates) of composite hepatic events in patients who had normal on-treatment ALT was 0.61 (95% CI 0.49–0.77; p <0.001) at 3 months; 0.55 (0.45–0.67; p <0.001) at 6 months; 0.54 (0.44–0.65; p <0.001) at 9 months; and 0.51 (0.42–0.61; p <0.001) at 12 months (Table 4).

SECTION

Dose response of ALT levels and hepatic events

PARAGRAPH

There was a dose response in terms of ALT level at 12 months and risk of hepatic events.

Taking patients who had normal on-treatment ALT at 12 months as reference group, aHR (adjusted for baseline ALT level only) of composite hepatic events in patients with ALT 1–2×ULN was 1.55 (95% CI 1.31–1.84; p <0.001); in those with ALT ≥2×ULN was 2.15 (1.67–2.77; p <0.001).

The aHR (adjusted for baseline ALT level and other relevant covariates) of composite hepatic events in patients with ALT 1–2×ULN was 1.85 (1.53–2.25; p <0.001); in those with ALT ≥2×ULN was 2.97 (2.21–3.97; p <0.001) (Table 4).

Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated the cumulative incidence (95% CI) of composite endpoint at 6 years of different ALT levels at 12 months: <ULN – 3.51 (3.06–4.02); 1–2×ULN – 5.43 (4.84–6.09); and ≥2×ULN – 7.08 (5.65–8.85; p <0.001 for trend) (Fig. 3A).

SECTION

Sensitivity analysis

PARAGRAPH

Asia Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver criteria of ULN of ALT, i.e. 40 U/L, was also used for the analysis of primary outcome; similar trend of reduced risks in patients who had normal on-treatment ALT was found (Table 4).

The impact of normal on-treatment ALT on HCC alone and non-HCC hepatic events was similar (Table S3).

Because of the smaller number of non-HCC hepatic events, the significant impact of normal on-treatment ALT could only be demonstrated at 12 months (but not at 3, 6 or 9 months) and ALT ≥2×ULN (but not ALT 1–2×ULN).

Similar findings were found when we adopted the ULN of ALT by the local laboratory (Fig. S1 and Fig. 3B).

Two of the commonly adopted HCC prediction scores, PAGE-B19 and CU-HCC,6,20 together with aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ALT De Ritis ratio,21 were used in a subgroup analysis which showed high on-treatment ALT has a similar impact on patients with a significant HCC risk (PAGE-B ≥10 and CU-HCC ≥5; Table 5), but not in patients with AST/ALT ratio >2 in view of the small number of patients.

PARAGRAPH

Composite hepatic events occurred in 41/2,735 (2.2%) patients receiving TDF ± ETV and 586/18,447 (4.9%) receiving ETV alone (p <0.001).

After stratification for ALT response, composite hepatic events occurred in 13/1,131 (1.6%) patients receiving TDF ± ETV and 220/9,306 (3.7%) receiving ETV alone (p = 0.020), in those with normal on-treatment ALT; and in 28/1,604 (2.5%) patients receiving TDF ± ETV and 366/9,141 (6.2%) receiving ETV alone (p <0.001) in those with elevated on-treatment ALT.

Normal on-treatment ALT had similar aHR (adjusted for baseline ALT level and other relevant covariates) in patients who received TDF ± ETV (n = 2,735) and ETV alone (n = 18,447) (0.48 and 0.52 respectively).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

This large-scale cohort study is the first to establish the importance of biochemical response in patients with CHB receiving NA treatment in a real-life setting.

The novel findings include the reduced risk of composite hepatic events in patients who had normal on-treatment ALT in the first 12 months of NA treatment.

Yet it is not the earlier to normal on-treatment ALT the better, as the aHR are comparable for normal on-treatment ALT at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.

There is also a dose response of on-treatment ALT levels and risk of hepatic events; the higher the ALT levels after 12 months of antiviral treatment, the higher the risk of hepatic events.

PARAGRAPH

A previous study conducted in 195 patients with CHB recruited in four randomized controlled trials revealed patients with biochemical and histologic responses had a much lower risk of liver-related events (HR 0.21 and 0.095 respectively).22

The importance of normal on-treatment ALT has been under the spotlight recently.

The registration trials of TAF revealed that normal on-treatment ALT rates by AASLD criteria were significantly higher in the TAF group than TDF group from four weeks onwards.23

The independent predictors for achieving normal on-treatment ALT by AASLD criteria includes TAF treatment, lower baseline HBV DNA level, negative HBeAg at baseline, male gender and the absence of cirrhosis.24

Conversely, patients who had no risk factors for metabolic syndrome (i.e. body mass index ≥25 kg/m2, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia) were more likely to achieve normal on-treatment ALT.

This implies metabolic syndrome and almost certainly fatty liver has a negative impact on normal on-treatment ALT in patients with CHB.23

Whether normal on-treatment ALT is a drug-specific phenomenon remains to be elucidated.

Our current study also demonstrated different rates of normal on-treatment ALT between patients receiving TDF and ETV; yet the aHR of normal on-treatment ALT on composite hepatic events in ETV- and TDF-treated patients were similar.

PARAGRAPH

Persistently elevated ALT despite complete viral suppression with these potent NAs, must have some non-viral cause; co-existence of fatty liver in patients with CHB is one of most plausible reasons in this setting.25

Metabolic syndrome, the strong risk factor of fatty liver, is prognostically important as it is associated with cirrhosis in patients with CHB,26 liver fibrosis progression,25 lower likelihood of cirrhosis regression in patients treated with TDF for five years10 and even cardiovascular death in patients with CHB.27

Hence the persistently high ALT despite antiviral treatment is likely a surrogate of co-existing fatty liver, which increases the risk of hepatic events and HCC.

PARAGRAPH

Our findings have several important clinical implications.

We should remain vigilant when considering the risk of disease progression and HCC in patients with persistent ALT elevation even after receiving potent NAs and achieving complete viral suppression.

We may consider further intervention to reduce risk of hepatic events.

Recent studies demonstrated the beneficial effect of statins on patients with CHB as they reduce the risk of HCC,28 liver decompensation and death18 in patients with chronic viral hepatitis.

PARAGRAPH

Our study has the strength of a large sample size and detailed serial ALT levels at different time points.

We also adopted stringent exclusion criteria and multivariable analysis to minimize bias.

Data from real-life cohorts represent a spectrum of patients wider than those in randomized controlled trials, in which patients with multiple comorbidities are often excluded.

The results are thus more applicable to routine clinical practice.

Nonetheless, our study has a few limitations.

First, we have missing data as in other retrospective studies, particularly for serum HBV DNA level as it was not routinely provided by public laboratories until recently.

Anthropometric data such as body mass index, and many laboratory parameters not directly related to hepatitis activity (e.g. high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, HbA1c) forming the NAFLD ridge score were missing.

This led to missing NAFLD ridge score in approximately 70% of the cohort, and also explained the very high prevalence of fatty liver in the 6,086 individuals with the score result available, as those parameters were usually checked in patients with risk factors of fatty liver.

Second, a small proportion (3.3% to 3.6%) of our patients had been exposed to lamivudine, adefovir or telbivudine; these may affect the timing of normal on-treatment ALT.

Third, the interval of ALT monitoring was irregular in this real-life setting; patients with higher baseline ALT level might have more frequent tests.

This might have led to a bias of apparently earlier normal on-treatment ALT in some patients with higher ALT level.

In our cohort the median (IQR) number of ALT results in patients with ALT ≥2×ULN and ALT <2×ULN were 5 (4–6) and 4 (3–5) respectively in the first 12 months of NA treatment.

Hence the bias should have minimal impact on our findings.

Fourth, the absolute difference of the risks in patients with normal and high on-treatment ALT was small (2.2%) yet statistically significant.

High on-treatment ALT level contributes a small additional risk of HCC on top of other well-known risk factors such as age, gender and cirrhosis.

Fifth, because of difference in the local reimbursement criteria, in particular before 2014, TDF was more commonly used as a second-line agent for patients with resistance to other NAs.

Lastly, unmeasured factors might have confounded the results, as we did not have information on medications outside the public system.

We also do not have information on drug adherence or over-the-counter drugs.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, patients with CHB would have a lower risk of hepatic events if they achieve normal on-treatment ALT in the first 12 months of NA treatment.

The higher the ALT levels during treatment, the higher the risk of hepatic events.

The impact of specific NA on normal on-treatment ALT warrants further study.
