TITLE

Impaired endothelial autophagy promotes liver fibrosis by aggravating the oxidative stress response during acute liver injury

PARAGRAPH

Liver endothelial cells are the first liver cell type affected after any kind of liver injury.

The loss of their unique phenotype during injury amplifies liver damage by orchestrating the response of the liver microenvironment.

Autophagy is a mechanism involved in the regulation of this initial response and its manipulation can modify the progression of liver damage.
