TITLE

Impaired endothelial autophagy promotes liver fibrosis by aggravating the oxidative stress response during acute liver injury

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Chronic liver injury from any source leads to progressive fibrosis, yet treatments are elusive.

A better understanding of the early changes that disrupt cellular homeostasis, and initiate and perpetuate fibrogenesis following liver injury is needed.

Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) constitute the liver’s first barrier of defense because of their unique position lining the sinusoidal lumen.

They are also the initial liver cell type to sense injury.

Maintenance of the LSEC phenotype associated with cellular pores, or fenestrae, is critical to maintaining homeostasis in the whole liver parenchyma.

Following hepatic damage, sinusoidal endothelial dysfunction may arise and it is characterized by the loss of both fenestrae (capillarization) and of its anti-fibrotic, anti-thrombotic and anti-vasodilatory properties, which are essential for the maintenance of liver integrity.1

LSEC injury also plays an essential role in initiation and progression of liver injury.

Indeed, signals derived from the sinusoidal endothelium during liver damage determine the outcome of pro-regenerative vs. pro-fibrotic processes.2,3

Despite its primary role in maladaptive healing and liver fibrosis,4,5 the phenotypic regulation of endothelial dysfunction is not fully understood.

PARAGRAPH

Autophagy is a major intracellular recycling system that maintains cellular homeostasis under basal conditions, and plays an integral role in regulating the cellular adaptive response during stress.6

Although autophagy has been implicated in the regulation of other resident liver cells (hepatocytes,7 stellate cells8 and macrophages9,10) and cardiovascular endothelial cell biology and physiopathology,11 its role in regulating liver endothelial phenotype during acute liver injury remains largely unknown.

PARAGRAPH

In the present study we hypothesized that endothelial autophagy is an endogenous protective system whose loss could undermine LSEC integrity and phenotype, ultimately leading to liver fibrosis.

Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the role of autophagy in the regulation of endothelial dysfunction and the impact of its manipulation during liver injury.

Animals

PARAGRAPH

Animals were housed in polycarbonate cages and maintained in a temperature and light controlled facility under standard food and water ad libitum.

All procedures were performed in accordance with Spanish legislation and approved by the Animal Research Committee of the University of Barcelona and were conducted in accordance with the European Community guidelines for the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes (EEC Directive 86/609).

Generation of endothelial Cell-specific Atg7 knockout mice

PARAGRAPH

Previously described Atg7Flox/Flox mice on the C57BL/6 background12 were crossed with a line expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the VE-Cadherin promoter to generate Atg7-VE-Cadherin-Cre (Atg7endo) mice, a mouse model with a selective deficiency of the essential autophagy gene Atg7 in endothelial cells.

SECTION

Induction of fibrosis in mice

PARAGRAPH

Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) (Sigma) was used to induce mild acute liver injury.

Mice received 3 intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 10% CCl4 (diluted in olive oil) at a dose of 0.5 μl/g body weight13 or vehicle (olive oil) every other day for 1 week.8

Animals were sacrificed 48 h after the last dose under ketamine/midazolam anesthesia.

At least 5 animals per group were used in isolation experiments and 6 to 12 animals per group in total tissue experiments making a total of 81 mice analyzed.

All experiments were performed with mice between 10 and 14 weeks of age.

We analyzed the effect of liver injury in male and female mice and the effect was similar in both genders, so all subsequent experiments were performed indistinctly in male and female mice.

SECTION

Induction of fibrosis in rats

PARAGRAPH

Hepatic injury was induced in 250–300 g male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (Charles River) by CCl4 (50% CCl4 diluted in olive oil at a dose of 1 µl/g of body weight) with 3 i.p. injections per week for 1, 4 or 6 weeks and compared with control rats injected with vehicle (olive oil).13

A minimum of 3 animals per group were used in isolation experiments accounting for a total of 36 rats.

Animals were sacrificed 48 h after the last dose (CCl4) under ketamine/midazolam anesthesia.

In brief, livers were perfused through the portal vein and digested with a collagenase solution.

After mincing the liver, cells were filtered and centrifuged at 50xG to remove hepatocytes.

Non-parenchymal cells were then separated by differential centrifugation using a Percoll gradient.

Kupffer cells were eliminated by plastic pre-culture for 30 min.

Protein ratios were normalized to housekeeping proteins (β-actin or GAPDH) and fold-change was calculated relative to control group.

PARAGRAPH

Autophagy flux: As autophagy is a dynamic process influenced by the degradation activity of the cargo and recycling, autophagic flux was measured using the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) (20 µM) for 2 h. Briefly, CQ inhibits degradation of the cargo in the autophagosome leading to the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles that can be measured by quantifying the lipidated form of MAP1LC3B/LC3B (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta) (LC3BII) present in the autophagic vacuole membrane, using western blot.

Histological analysis

PARAGRAPH

Histological analysis of the samples was performed on H&E stained slides by an expert pathologist.

The inflammatory infiltrates in the liver parenchyma were evaluated in the portal, pericentral and lobular area using a score from 0 to 3 according to the following criteria: 0 = none; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe.

The regenerative aspect of hepatocytes was determined, considering the peculiarity of these cells’ nucleus, by analyzing the presence of diploid hepatocytes and open chromatin, as well as the number of cells undergoing mitosis in the liver parenchyma.

The assessment of necrosis was performed as follows: 1 = <5%; 2 = 5–29%; 3 = >30% of the analyzed parenchyma.

Ballooning of hepatocytes was considered as 1 (mild) when it represented <4%, 2 (moderate) when it represented between 5 and 15% of the hepatic cells and finally, 3 (marked) when ballooning was seen in >15% of the liver parenchyma.

Results

SECTION

Autophagy is upregulated during LSEC capillarization in vitro and in vivo

PARAGRAPH

After 24 h of growth on plastic in culture, isolated LSECs typically lose their fenestrated phenotype;4 in the absence of growth factors, they become dysfunctional by 48 h and lose viability.23

To link these changes to autophagic activity, freshly isolated LSECs from untreated SD rats were cultured up to 48 h on collagen-coated plastic.

After 24 h in culture, LSECs expressed the previously reported typical transcriptional changes that accompany capillarization in vitro,4,24,25 which include the downregulated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (Vegfr2 [Kdr]) and upregulation of endothelin-1 (Edn1) mRNAs (Fig. 1A).

These changes were accompanied by increased autophagic activity.

As seen in Fig. 1B, primary LSECs cultured for 24 h demonstrated enhanced autophagic flux based on an increase of LC3BII levels in the presence of the autophagy inhibitor CQ (Fig. 1B) and colocalization of LC3B and LAMP2 (Fig. 1C).

However, after longer periods of culture (48 h) when LSECs are completely dysfunctional, autophagy levels began declining (Fig. 1B, C).

PARAGRAPH

Because in vitro experiments, even using freshly isolated LSECs, may not adequately represent the complexity of the LSEC defenestration process, we determined whether autophagic activity increases during endothelial dysfunction in vivo after liver injury.

SD rats were treated with CCl4 (i.p. injection every other day) at different time-points and the grade of liver fibrosis was assessed.

Whereas 1-week of CCl4 did not induce either endothelial dysfunction or autophagy (data not shown), after 4 weeks mild fibrosis was induced and after 6 weeks fibrosis was severe; thus in vivo studies were conducted at 4 and 6 weeks.

Cells isolated from SD rats with CCl4-induced mild fibrosis (4 weeks) or severe fibrosis (6 weeks) developed an abnormal phenotype characterized by downregulation of Vegfr2 and upregulation of Edn1 mRNAs (Fig. 1D).

LSECs from rats with mild fibrosis displayed an augmented autophagy flux that recapitulated their in vitro response, but was unable to further increase when fibrosis was more severe (6 weeks) (Fig. 1E, Fig. S1), implicating a role of endothelial autophagy during early phases of liver injury.

Also, in agreement with this observation, when dysfunctional LSECs isolated from rats with CCl4-induced mild fibrosis were cultivated on plastic, they were unable to further upregulate autophagy levels (Fig. S2).

PARAGRAPH

These data suggest that upregulation of endothelial autophagy may play a role in the adaptive response at early stages of liver injury, but it is overcome if the damage persists, and thus endothelial dysfunction arises.

SECTION

Endothelial autophagy maintains LSEC homeostasis

PARAGRAPH

We then addressed the prospect that endothelial autophagy might regulate the phenotype of LSECs and orchestrate the early response to liver injury.

To determine the role of endothelial autophagy during liver fibrosis in vivo, we generated a transgenic mouse line in which expression of the essential autophagy gene Atg7 was specifically deleted in endothelial cells (Atg7endo mice) (Fig. 2).

As previously described,12 Atg7flox/flox mice26 were crossed with mice carrying the Cre recombinase under the endothelial-specific promoter VE-cadherin (Jackson laboratory) (Fig. 2A).

Primary LSECs were isolated from the Atg7endo mice and Atg7 knockdown was confirmed by immunoblotting and qPCR (Fig. 2B,C).

In agreement with previous studies,26 LSECs isolated from Atg7endo mice displayed a downregulation of autophagy levels, indicated by a reduced number of autophagic vacuoles compared with their control littermates (Atg7control) when quantified by electron microscopy (Fig. S3), accumulation of p62 and decrease LC3BII/I ratio measured by western blot (Fig. 2C).

PARAGRAPH

At baseline, mice with autophagy-defective LSEC (Atg7endo) displayed a normal liver architecture (Fig. 3A) without hepatocyte injury (Fig. 3B) and did not show an obvious phenotype beyond a reduced body weight (Fig. 3C) when compared with their control littermates (Atg7control).

However, following mild acute liver injury (1 week of CCl4)8 Atg7endo mice developed amplified endothelial dysfunction (Fig. 4), demonstrated by the upregulation of mRNA levels of Edn1 and downregulation of Vegfr2 (Fig. 4A).

Although these mRNAs have been proposed as surrogate markers of capillarization, it remained critical to evaluate the actual loss of fenestrae by SEM,27,28 which is considered the gold standard technique for this purpose.

SEM enables the assessment of large areas of the endothelial surface and measurement of size, frequency and porosity (the percentage of LSEC membrane that is occupied by fenestrations).4,18,28,29

SEM analysis confirmed a significant decrease in porosity and the number of fenestrae (Fig. 4B), further confirming the greater level of endothelial dysfunction in the Atg7endo mice after mild acute liver injury.

We also evaluated endothelial dysfunction in whole liver tissue by quantifying levels of the glycoprotein vWF, which were increased, consistent with a more dysfunctional phenotype (Fig. 4C).

PARAGRAPH

Together, these data confirm that endothelial autophagy impairment provokes endothelial dysfunction, suggesting that as in other cells, autophagy may be an adaptive response to stress.

PARAGRAPH

Loss of endothelial autophagy aggravates liver fibrosis without affecting liver inflammation

PARAGRAPH

We next evaluated the role of autophagy in fibrosis after mild acute liver injury.

In Atg7endo mice liver fibrosis was greatly amplified when compared with Atg7control mice (Fig. 5).

Collagen accumulation evaluated by Sirius Red and hydroxyproline content was increased (Fig. 5A), together with the increased expression of the HSC activation marker αSMA, as evaluated both by western blot analysis of primary isolated HSC and total liver immunohistochemistry (Fig. 5B,C).

In contrast, there were no differences in the expression of desmin (Fig. 5C) or the proliferation marker PDGFRB (Fig. 5D), suggesting that the effect on fibrosis was due to activation of HSCs and not an increase in the total HSC number or their proliferation.

Interestingly, Atg7endo mice had conserved regenerative capacity (Fig. 5E) and a similar degree of liver injury as Atg7control (Fig. 5E,F).

PARAGRAPH

Interestingly, mild acute liver injury did not modify liver inflammation in our Atg7endo mice compared with Atg7control mice.

Acute CCl4-induced injury induced mild pericentral inflammation similarly in the 2 groups of animals (Fig. 5G,H).

PARAGRAPH

These results suggest that endothelial autophagy impairment under stress conditions (mild acute liver injury) aggravates liver fibrosis by directly activating HSCs.

SECTION

Loss of LSEC autophagy is associated with an insufficient antioxidant response

PARAGRAPH

Reduction in endothelial NO bioavailability has been identified as one of the main governors of LSEC defenestration.

Both a decrease in NO production and an increase in the reactive oxygen species O2−, which reacts rapidly with NO to form peroxynitrite, reducing NO bioavailability.

Moreover, oxidative stress plays a central role in the development and progression of liver fibrosis19 by inducing oxidative injury and endothelial dysfunction.30,31

Because autophagy has been identified as a major mechanism, which protects cells from oxidative stress in a wide range of cells,6,32–34 we reasoned that autophagy might help to maintain LSEC phenotype providing an adequate redox balance in endothelial cells.

PARAGRAPH

To mimic the effect of intracellular oxidative stress generation, we directly stimulated endothelial cells with exogenous H2O2.

We used 2 different cell lines, human endothelial cells (HUVECs) and mouse LSECs (TSECs).

H2O2 provoked upregulation in autophagy in both cell lines (Fig. S4).

PARAGRAPH

Therefore, we examined if pharmacological manipulation of endothelial autophagy modified oxidative stress.

HUVECs were treated with the autophagy inhibitor CQ (Fig. 6A) or the autophagy inducer rapamycin (Fig. S5) and O2− levels were measured by DHE; this data shows that inhibition of autophagy increases oxidative stress, which was attenuated when autophagy was upregulated.

To establish a more specific link between autophagy and oxidant injury, TSECs were transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing small hairpin RNA to Atg7 (siAtg7 cells) or with an empty lentivirus control (VEC) (Fig. S6).

As predicted, genetic deletion of Atg7 amplified O2− levels (Fig. 6B), further suggesting that endothelial autophagy maintains liver homeostasis at least in part by alleviating oxidative stress.

PARAGRAPH

We next corroborated these data in vivo by evaluating oxidative stress levels in Atg7endo mice after mild acute liver injury.

Intracellular O2− production measured by DHE (Fig. 6C) and the content of hepatic nitrotyrosinate proteins, a fingerprint of peroxynitrite formation and a marker of NO scavenging by O2− were markedly elevated (Fig. 6D) in whole liver tissue of the Atg7endo mice compared to Atg7control mice suggesting a decreased NO bioavailability.

Indeed, cGMP a marker of intrahepatic NO availability, was significantly reduced in the Atg7endo mice compared to Atg7control mice (Fig. 6E).

PARAGRAPH

Reduction in NO bioavailability may result from a decrease in endothelial NO production but also from impaired ROS removal.14–18

Furthermore, recent data in vascular endothelial cells from kidney and the cardiovascular system have demonstrated that autophagy regulates eNOS production.19–22

We therefore examined whether inhibition of autophagy impairs NO production in our endothelial autophagy-deficient mice after CCl4 induced liver injury.

Decreased NO production due to reduced eNOS activity (measured by eNOS phosphorylationSer1177/eNOS total ratio) was observed in the Atg7endo mice compared to Atg7control mice (Fig. 6F) suggesting that endothelial autophagy helps to cope with CCl4-induced oxidative stress by directly regulating intrahepatic NO bioavailability.

PARAGRAPH

However, autophagy may control the antioxidant response in LSECs by additionally removing oxidative species.

We evaluated the detoxifying response of LSECs after mild acute liver injury.

We evaluated the classical antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), in primary isolated LSECs from Atg7endo and Atg7control mice after acute CCl4-induced injury.

As shown (Fig. 7A), a significant downregulation in these protective genes was observed.

The antioxidant activity of these genes in whole liver tissue was also insufficient to alleviate the accumulation of oxidative species provoked by endothelial-specific autophagy impairment, reinforcing the importance of LSEC as the main scavenger cell type of the liver (Fig. S7).

PARAGRAPH

The activity of the classical antioxidant genes can be bolstered by the so-called ‘phase II detoxifying enzymes’ regulated by the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2 [Nfe2l2]).

Under oxidative stress, Nrf2 is phosphorylated and translocates into the nucleus, where it interacts with the antioxidant response element (ARE) within the promoters of genes encoding NADPH: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1), heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox1), glutathione-S-transferase mu subunit (Gstm), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic (Gclc) and modulatory (Gclm) subunits and sulfiredoxin-1 (Srxn1).35,36

Besides, Nrf2 can also be activated by the cytosolic protein p62 in conditions of autophagy deficiency.

p62 degradation is impaired when autophagy is compromised and dissociates the redox-sensitive transcription complex Nrf2-Keap1, allowing Nrf2 to translocatet to the nucleus and activate transcription of the ARE genes.37,38

Indeed, as shown (Fig. 7B), the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response in autophagy-deficient LSECs was upregulated, but was not sufficient to counteract the elevated oxidative stress, probably due, at least in part, to the shortage in NO. We also evaluated 2 of the main Nrf2-targets and further verify its upregulation at protein level (Fig. 7C), as an attempt to remove ROS in the Atg7endo mice.

Remarkably, the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response was unchanged in whole liver tissue, emphasizing the concept that impaired autophagy is the main trigger for Nrf2 activation and its activation may be limited to autophagy-deficient cells (Fig. S7).

PARAGRAPH

All together these data support the concept that autophagy regulates LSEC response to oxidative stress by regulating both NO bioavailability and ROS removal.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Capillarization of sinusoids represents a change in LSEC phenotype characterized by the loss of fenestration, which induces HSC activation and liver fibrogenesis.1

Although HSCs can be activated through other mechanisms during liver injury, signals coming from the endothelium determine and orchestrate the early liver response to a given injury.2,3

Preventing endothelial dysfunction is an attractive therapeutic strategy that could interrupt progression to liver fibrosis; however, the mechanisms controlling LSEC phenotypic changes are still not fully understood.

PARAGRAPH

Our findings demonstrate that autophagic activity modulates LSEC capillarization.

Loss of autophagy selectively in LSECs amplifies endothelial dysfunction and activates HSCs following mild acute liver injury.

Basal autophagy in LSECs, as in other cells of the liver39 is low, but it is rapidly upregulated as an adaptive response under conditions of cellular stress both in vitro and in vivo.

In our Atg7endo mice, the moderate reduction of autophagy achieved in LSECs, may be sufficient to maintain adequate levels of endothelial autophagy under basal conditions to preserve a normal architecture.

However, during early phases of injury, autophagy upregulation plays an important role in maintaining LSEC phenotype.

Indeed, if the insult is either too intense or persists over time, autophagy induction is overcome leading to endothelial dysfunction and progressive fibrosis.

In agreement with this concept, autophagy is rapidly upregulated in hepatocytes following alcohol injury in alcoholic liver disease, but over time there is a gradual loss of autophagy function,40 supporting the idea that autophagy plays an essential role in early phases of the pathological process.

PARAGRAPH

Remarkably, loss of LSEC autophagy provokes not only an exacerbation of endothelial dysfunction under conditions of cellular stress but also impacts the surrounding microenvironment by specifically modulating HSC activation.

Indeed our transgenic animals did not have increased inflammation or prominent liver injury, supporting the concept that LSECs act as gatekeeper of HSC activation.28,41

PARAGRAPH

NO has been previously identified as a master regulator of LSEC phenotype and contributes to maintaining redox balance.

Because oxidant stress frequently accompanies liver injury and fibrogenesis and can induce autophagy,42 we hypothesized that autophagy may preserve the LSEC phenotype at least in part by regulating NO, neutralizing ROS and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

Indeed, exogenous ROS generation in endothelial cells was able to trigger autophagy.

Moreover, disruption of endothelial autophagy, either pharmacologically or genetically, led to an aberrant antioxidant response and accumulation of ROS.

PARAGRAPH

Our data also demonstrate that endothelial autophagy deficiency reduces intrahepatic NO bioavailability due to both decreased production and increased scavenging, which impairs the antioxidant response.

In conditions of liver injury, where the demands of maintaining redox homeostasis are increased, autophagy-deficient LSECs are incapable of increasing NO levels to maintain their phenotype, ROS accumulates and endothelial dysfunction arises.

LSECs are equipped with powerful antioxidant systems to remove ROS.

The classical major regulators of cellular redox balance antioxidant enzyme (CAT, SOD and GPx) could not be upregulated in LSECs from our Atg7endo mice during mild acute liver injury, leading to an inefficient adaptation to oxidative stress.

This inability to cope with ROS and the loss of autophagy triggers Nrf2 activation and ARE upregulation to foster a more intense antioxidant response.

The increase in p62 levels that accompanies autophagy impairment dissociates the redox-sensitive transcription complex Nrf2-Keap1 and leads to increased stabilization, translocation to the nucleus and activation of the transcription of the antioxidant genes Nqo1, Hmox1, Gstm, Gclc, Gclm and Srxn1.38

The upregulation of these genes in the Atg7endo mice reinforces the idea that autophagy regulates the antioxidant response in LSECs.

Together, our data support the idea that autophagy-deficient LSECs are unable to neutralize the antioxidant stress that accompanies liver injury, in part due to an inefficient antioxidant response and inability to maintain adequate NO production.

However, it remains to be elucidated whether upregulation of Nrf2 depends mainly on oxidant stress, autophagy deficiency or both.

PARAGRAPH

Despite all the evidence supporting the association of oxidative stress and liver disease, how “antioxidant” compounds may regulate LSEC phenotype remains largely uncovered.

Moreover, failure of antioxidant therapies in slowing fibrosis progression43–45 in real clinical practice, favors the idea that interventions only removing ROS may not be enough.

Indeed, we have shown that following acute CCl4-induced damage, LSEC de-differentiation due to autophagy dysfunction promoted decreased NO bioavailability, ROS accumulation and liver fibrogenesis, through HSC activation.

Our data suggest that the inability of autophagy-deficient-LSECs to handle oxidative stress is responsible, at least in part, for promoting HSC activation; however, whether autophagy-mediated sinusoidal capillarization actively fosters HSC activation via release of specific paracrine mediators remains to be determined.

Indeed, capillarized LSEC may contribute to HSC phenotypic and functional modulation not only by regulating NO production, but also by secreting other pro-fibrotic factors.2,3

PARAGRAPH

Notwithstanding these functions, autophagy may also alleviate oxidative stress by other additional mechanisms such as removal of ROS-damaged organelles, such as the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, as it has been demonstrated in other cell types, but it deserves detailed future specific studies in LSECs.

Moreover, autophagy may also regulate other cellular pathways in LSECs besides NO and the antioxidant response.

Indeed a previous study from our group demonstrated that autophagy upregulates the transcription factor KLF2 during ischemia-reperfusion injury and modulates endothelial survival.22

Recently, autophagy has also been implicated in LSEC defenestration by controlling caveolin-1 expression.46

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, our data demonstrate that autophagy contributes to maintain cellular phenotype and protects LSECs from oxidative stress during early phases of liver injury, but may not be enough to revert damage in advanced stages of chronic liver injury.

Endothelial autophagy dysregulation activates HSC and aggravates fibrosis during mild acute liver injury.

Potentiation of autophagy selectively in LSECs during early stages of liver disease may be an attractive approach in order to prevent disease progression, thus modifying the natural course of chronic liver diseases.
