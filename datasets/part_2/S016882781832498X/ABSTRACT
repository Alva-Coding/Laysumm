ABSTRACT

TITLE

Impaired endothelial autophagy promotes liver fibrosis by aggravating the oxidative stress response during acute liver injury

PARAGRAPH

Endothelial dysfunction plays an essential role in liver injury, yet the phenotypic regulation of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) remains unknown.

Autophagy is an endogenous protective system whose loss could undermine LSEC integrity and phenotype.

The aim of our study was to investigate the role of autophagy in the regulation of endothelial dysfunction and the impact of its manipulation during liver injury.

PARAGRAPH

We analyzed primary isolated LSECs from Atg7control and Atg7endo mice as well as rats after CCl4 induced liver injury.

Liver tissue and primary isolated stellate cells were used to analyze liver fibrosis.

Autophagy flux, microvascular function, nitric oxide bioavailability, cellular superoxide content and the antioxidant response were evaluated in endothelial cells.

PARAGRAPH

Autophagy maintains LSEC homeostasis and is rapidly upregulated during capillarization in vitro and in vivo.

Pharmacological and genetic downregulation of endothelial autophagy increases oxidative stress in vitro.

During liver injury in vivo, the selective loss of endothelial autophagy leads to cellular dysfunction and reduced intrahepatic nitric oxide.

The loss of autophagy also impairs LSECs ability to handle oxidative stress and aggravates fibrosis.

PARAGRAPH

Autophagy contributes to maintaining endothelial phenotype and protecting LSECs from oxidative stress during early phases of liver disease.

Selectively potentiating autophagy in LSECs during early stages of liver disease may be an attractive approach to modify the disease course and prevent fibrosis progression.
