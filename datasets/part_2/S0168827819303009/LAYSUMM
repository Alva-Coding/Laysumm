Nivolumab in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: Sorafenib-experienced Asian cohort analysis

PARAGRAPH

The CheckMate 040 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of nivolumab in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who were refractory to previous sorafenib treatment or chemotherapy.

This subanalysis of the data showed that treatment responses and safety in patients in Asia were similar to those of the overall treatment population, providing support for nivolumab as a treatment option for these patients.
