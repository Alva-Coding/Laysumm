TITLE

Prospective evaluation of a primary care referral pathway for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease effects up to 30% of the population but only a minority of cases develop liver disease.

Our study has shown that established blood tests can be used in primary care to stratify patients with fatty liver disease, leading to a reduction in unnecessary referrals by 80% and greatly improving the detection of cases of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.
