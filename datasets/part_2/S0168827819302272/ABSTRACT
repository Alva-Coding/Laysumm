ABSTRACT

TITLE

Prospective evaluation of a primary care referral pathway for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

PARAGRAPH

The development of non-invasive liver fibrosis tests may enable earlier identification of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) requiring referral to secondary care.

We developed and evaluated a pathway for the management of patients with NAFLD, aimed at improving the detection of cases of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, and avoiding unnecessary referrals.

PARAGRAPH

This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study, with analyses performed before and after introduction of the pathway, and comparisons made to unexposed controls.

We used a 2-step algorithm combining the use of Fibrosis-4 score followed by the ELF™ test if required.

PARAGRAPH

In total, 3,012 patients were analysed.

Use of the pathway detected 5 times more cases of advanced fibrosis (Kleiner F3) and cirrhosis (odds ratio [OR] 5.18; 95% CI 2.97–9.04; p <0.0001), while reducing unnecessary referrals from primary care to secondary care by 81% (OR 0.193; 95% CI 0.111–0.337; p <0.0001).

Although it was used for only 48% of referrals, significant benefits were observed in practices exposed to the pathway compared to those which were not, with unnecessary referrals falling by 77% (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.658–0.082; p = 0.006) and a 4-fold improvement in detection of cases of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis (OR 4.32; 95% CI 1.52–12.25; p = 0.006).

Compared to referrals made before the introduction of the pathway, unnecessary referrals fell from 79/83 referrals (95.2%) to 107/152 (70.4%), representing an 88% reduction in unnecessary referrals when the pathway was followed (OR 0.12; 95% CI 0.042–0.349; p <0.0001).

PARAGRAPH

The use of non-invasive blood tests for liver fibrosis improves the detection of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, while reducing unnecessary referrals in patients with NAFLD.

This strategy improves resource use and benefits patients.
