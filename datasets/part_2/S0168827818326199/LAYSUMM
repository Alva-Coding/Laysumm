TITLE

A serum protein factor mediates maturation and apoB-association of HCV particles in the extracellular milieu

PARAGRAPH

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles may associate with apoB and acquire neutral lipids after exiting cells, giving them low-buoyant density.

The hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) is a majorviral determinant of E2 that controls this process.

Besides lipoproteins, specific serum factors including albumin promote extracellular maturation of HCV virions.

HCV particle production in vitro, with media of defined serum conditions, enables production of infectious particles resembling those of chronically infected patients.
