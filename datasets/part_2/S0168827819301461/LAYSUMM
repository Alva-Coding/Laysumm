TITLE

Loss of fibrocystin promotes interleukin-8-dependent proliferation and CTGF production of biliary epithelium

PARAGRAPH

Congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) is a genetic liver disease caused by mutations of the PKHD1 gene.

Dysfunction of the protein it encodes, fibrocystin, is closely associated with CHF pathogenesis.

Using an in vitro human induced pluripotent stem cell model and patient samples, we showed that the loss of fibrocystin function promotes proliferation of cholangiocytes and the production of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in an interleukin 8 (IL-8)-dependent manner.

These results suggest that IL-8 and CTGF are essential for the pathogenesis of CHF.
