TITLE

ALDH2 deficiency promotes alcohol-associated liver cancer by activating oncogenic pathways via oxidized DNA-enriched extracellular vesicles

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.

Chronic alcohol abuse is a major cause of HCC development; its metabolite, acetaldehyde is believed to play an important role in inducing HCC.1

Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) is a major enzyme for acetaldehyde elimination.

The Glu487Lys polymorphism (also named rs671, with the glutamate corresponding to *1 allele, and lysine corresponding to *2 allele) at codon 487 in the ALDH2 gene causes the substitution of glutamate (Glu) by lysine (Lys), which exists in approximately 40% of east Asian populations.2

Such a polymorphism (Glu to Lys, or G to A, or *1 to *2) disrupts ALDH2 activity, causing high blood acetaldehyde concentration and “alcohol flush reactions” after alcohol consumption.1

Alcoholics with heterozygous ALDH2*1/*2 or homozygous ALDH2*2/*2 polymorphism have ALDH2 deficiency and have an increased risk of developing digestive tract cancers,3 however, the association of this polymorphism with HCC development and how acetaldehyde affects HCC still remain obscure.

PARAGRAPH

A case‐control study of a small number of patients (78 cases) suggests that the frequency of the ALDH2*2/*2 allele correlated with an increased risk of HCC among heavy drinkers,4 but it is not clear whether this ALDH2 polymorphism is associated with HCC caused by etiologies other than alcohol.

In the current study, we examined 646 patients with viral hepatitis B (HBV) infection and found that ALDH2 deficiency was not associated with an increased risk of HCC development in patients with HBV, without alcohol consumption, but was a risk factor for HCC in cirrhotic patients with HBV who consumed excessive alcohol, suggesting that cirrhosis, alcohol consumption, and ALDH2 deficiency synergistically promote HCC.

To model this clinical condition, we developed a mouse model of HCC induced by chronic CCl4 administration (fibrosis) and alcohol feeding, and tested this model in 3 lines of Aldh2-deficient mice: including Aldh2 global knockout (KO), Aldh2*1/*2 knock-in, and liver-specific Aldh2 KO (Aldh2Hep−/−) mice.

Our data revealed that all of these Aldh2-deficient mice were more susceptible to CCl4 plus alcohol-associated HCC development than their wild-type (WT) counterparts.

PARAGRAPH

ALDH2 deficiency is known to induce excessive acetaldehyde accumulation and oxidative stress during alcohol consumption, leading to mitochondrial DNA damage and base modifications such as oxidation of deoxyguanosine to 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OhDG) leading to mitochondrial dysfunction.5

Consequently, mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated DNA damage further accelerates cellular senescence, and contributes to aging-associated phenotypes and pathologies in various types of diseases and cancer including HCC.6

Herein, we provide evidence suggesting that extracellular vesicles (EVs) can transfer this damaged DNA from hepatocytes into HCC cells, thereby promoting HCC progression, suggesting a cross-talk between damaged hepatocytes and HCC cells via the transfer of oxidized mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-enriched EVs that promote HCC.

PARAGRAPH

EVs are well-known as a means of intercellular communication, capable of delivering proteins, miRNAs, DNAs, and glycolipids.

They play important roles in the physiology and pathology of the liver.7,8

Interestingly, EVs are also commonly detected in the tumor microenvironment and play a role in facilitating tumorigenesis by regulating angiogenesis, immunity, and metastasis.9

In the current study, we demonstrated that after chronic CCl4 and ethanol exposure, Aldh2-deficient hepatocytes produced oxidized mtDNA-enriched EVs, which were transferred into HCC cells and activated multiple oncogenic pathways that have previously been implicated in promoting HCC.

These pathways include signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3),10,11 C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK),12,13 transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ),14,15 and BCL-2 protein.16,17

Results

SECTION

ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of HCC in patients with HBV and excessive alcohol consumption, but not in those without alcohol consumption

PARAGRAPH

To study the association of ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism with liver disease progression and cancer, we examined 646 patients with HBV and chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and HCC with or without excessive alcohol consumption (Table S1).

Because those who carried an A allele are associated with low ALDH2 activity, and the number of patients with homozygous AA genotype was small, we thus combined patients with GA and AA genotypes into one group GA/AA for ALDH2 deficiency in our analyses.

Among these genotypes, there were no differences in age, gender, antiviral drug treatment, and viral load (Table S1).

As illustrated in Table 1, among patients with excessive alcohol consumption, the allele frequencies for GA/AA in patients with HBV-related HCC were statistically higher than those with HBV-related cirrhosis.

In contrast, no distribution in the allele frequency for those with HBV-related cirrhosis and HBV-related HCC were observed among patients without alcohol consumption (Table 1 and Fig. S1A).

PARAGRAPH

We next determined the effects of the ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism on HCC staging among patients with HBV-related HCC stratified by excessive alcohol consumption.

As illustrated in Table 1 and Fig. S1B, we observed the association between those with A allele (GA/AA) and advanced stages of HCC only in those with alcohol consumption.

The allele frequencies for GA/AA in patients with HCC and excessive alcohol consumption who had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C (54.83%) or D (32.26%) were significantly higher than those with BCLC stage B (3.23%, p = 0.007).

We also used the logistic regression analysis to determine the association between those with A allele and HCC staging and found the ORs of 11.69 (p = 0.01) and 15.71 (p = 0.003), in patients with GA/AA genotypes presented with BCLC stage C and D, respectively, compared to those with stage B. Taken together, our data suggested that the risk of HCC development in patients with HBV and underlying cirrhosis only occurred in ALDH2-deficient patients who consumed alcohol.

Additionally, ALDH2 deficiency is also associated with advanced stages of HCC among excessive alcohol drinkers.

SECTION

Aldh2-deficient mice are more susceptible to CCl4+EtOH-induced HCC

PARAGRAPH

To model our clinical observation on HCC development in drinkers with underlying cirrhosis, we thus developed a mouse model of liver cancer by chronic CCl4 administration for 18 weeks to induce severe liver fibrosis and followed by feeding 4% alcohol diet along with the injection of CCl4 for an additional 10 weeks (denoted CCl4+EtOH) (Fig. 1A).

Hepatic histopathology from CCl4+EtOH-treated mice showed fibrosis, steatosis, inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning degeneration, and tumor nodules (data not shown).

Immunohistochemistry analyses detected the expression of HepPar-1, an immunohistochemical marker of HCC (Fig. S2A), suggesting CCl4+EtOH treatment induces HCC, however, no tumor metastasis was found in other organs (Fig. S2B).

These results suggest that the induction of CCl4-mediated liver fibrosis followed by alcohol administration is a mouse model for alcohol-associated HCC.

PARAGRAPH

Next, we tested this mouse model in 3 different lines of Aldh2-deficient mice, including Aldh2−/−, Aldh2*1/*2 knock-in, Aldh2Hep−/− mice, and their corresponding controls.

Aldh2*1/*2 mice were developed by replacing the mouse WT Aldh2 allele with a mouse E487K mutant Aldh2 allele, and resulted in marked loss of ALDH2 activity.19

The body weight was decreased in Aldh2−/− and Aldh2*1/*2 mice but not in Aldh2Hep−/− mice after alcohol feeding (Fig. S2C-D).

Interestingly, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were lower in all Aldh2-deficient mice after CCl4+EtOH vs. WT mice (Fig. 1B).

Collagen deposition and α-SMA expression were greater in CCl4+EtOH-treated Aldh2−/− vs. WT mice, however, no differences were observed between these 2 groups after treatment with only CCl4 (Fig. 1C).

A greater degree of liver fibrosis was also observed in CCl4+EtOH-treated Aldh2*1/*2 and Aldh2Hep−/− mice compared to their controls (Fig. S3A-C).

Furthermore, the number and size of tumors were greater in CCl4+EtOH-treated Aldh2−/− mice vs. WT mice (Fig. 1D).

In CCl4 treated group, the number, but not the size of tumor was also higher in Aldh2−/− mice compared to WT mice (Fig. 1D).

Moreover, CCl4+EtOH-treated Aldh2*1/*2 and Aldh2Hep−/− mice also had greater degree of liver fibrosis and number/size of tumors compared to their WT counterparts (Fig. 1E, Fig. S3A-C).

PARAGRAPH

Liver progenitor cells (LPCs) with self-renewing abilities have been implicated in liver carcinogenesis through their transformation toward cancer stem cells and high ALDH activity is considered a functional marker of LPC.21

Thus, we hypothesized whether Aldh2 deficiency promotes LPC proliferation, which accelerates HCC progression.

Because very few LPCs are detected in our CCl4+EtOH model, we used 2 other models that significantly induce LPCs in the liver by feeding mice with choline-deficient ethionine supplemented (CDE) or 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet.

Our data revealed that deletion of Aldh2 did not affect LPC proliferation in CDE- or DDC-fed mice (Fig. S4A-C).

Deletion of Aldh1a1 neither affected LPC proliferation in these models nor affected HCC progression induced by DEN+CCl4 (Fig. S4A-C).

Interestingly, the number of LPCs was lower in Aldh2−/− mice than in WT mice after alcohol feeding in both models (Fig. S4B).

These data suggest that ALDH deficiency-associated HCC progression is unlikely mediated by stimulating LPCs.

SECTION

Aldh2-deficient mice are more susceptible to CCl4+EtOH-induced oxidative stress and activation of various oncogenic pathways

PARAGRAPH

To understand the mechanisms underlying ALDH2 deficiency-associated HCC acceleration, we measured reactive oxygen species (ROS) in alcohol-associated hepatic tumor regions.

As illustrated in Fig. 2A, immunohistochemistry analyses revealed that CCl4+EtOH-treated Aldh2−/− mice expressed greater hepatic levels of lipid peroxidation markers including malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) than those of WT mice, which was also confirmed by western blot analyses.

In contrast, the expression of FOXO3A, an oxidative stress resistance protein, was lower in Aldh2−/− mice vs. WT mice.

We further evaluated the expression of NRF2 and CTNNB1, which complexes with FOXO3A for anti-oxidant gene transcription.22

Interestingly, expression of NRF2 protein and mRNA was not altered while expression of β-catenin (encoded by CTNNB1) was upregulated in CCl4+EtOH-treated Aldh2−/− mice vs. WT mice (Fig. S5A).

In addition, levels of hepatic glutathione (GSH), an important anti-oxidant, and the expression of ROS detoxification genes such including Sod1, Sod2 and Catalase 1 was lower in CCl4+EtOH-treated Aldh2−/− mice vs. WT mice (Fig. 2B).

Similar to these data, hepatic mRNA levels of Sod1, Sod2 and Catalase 1 were also downregulated in CCl4+EtOH-treated Aldh2Hep−/− mice vs. WT mice (Fig. S5B).

The mechanisms underlying downregulation of anti-oxidant genes in Aldh2-deficient mice are not clear, but it may be due to extensively produced oxidative stress in these mice as described above.

PARAGRAPH

Oxidative stress is known to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (e.g. JNK, and p38) and STAT3 phosphorylation, which is associated with HCC development.10,11,13

Thus, we evaluated these kinase proteins in adjacent non-tumor and tumor regions in CCl4+EtOH-treated HCC mouse model.

As illustrated in Fig. 2C and Fig. S5C, pJNK, pP38, and pSTAT3 levels were significantly higher in Aldh2-deficient tumor tissues compared to those of WT.

Furthermore, the number of TUNEL+ apoptotic cells was lower, whereas Bcl-2 mRNA levels were higher in CCl4+EtOH- treated Aldh2−/− mice vs. WT mice (Fig. 2C-D, Fig. S5D).

SECTION

TAZ and its target CTGF levels are higher in HCC from CCl4+EtOH-treated Aldh2-deficient mice vs. WT mice

PARAGRAPH

Hyperactivation of YAP/TAZ, 2 transcription factors mediating Hippo signaling, promotes cell proliferation while inhibiting cell death, ultimately leading to tumorigenesis.14,15

To test whether YAP/TAZ is involved in HCC development, we measured the expression of YAP/TAZ and found that the levels of TAZ protein and mRNA were higher in HCC from CCl4+EtOH-treated Aldh2−/− mice vs. WT mice; while YAP levels were comparable between these 2 groups (Fig. 3A-B).

Greater TAZ protein levels in Aldh2−/− mouse HCC were further confirmed by immunohistochemistry analyses (Fig. 3C).

PARAGRAPH

YAP and TAZ transcription factors regulate downstream gene expression when they are translocated from the cytoplasm to nuclei.14,15

Here we found that nuclear TAZ protein levels but not nuclear YAP protein were much higher in CCl4+EtOH-treated Aldh2−/− HCC compared to WT HCC (Fig. 3D), suggesting that TAZ but not YAP is activated in HCC from CCl4+EtOH-treated Aldh2−/− mice.

In agreement with TAZ activation, hepatic expression of the TAZ targeted gene Ctgf mRNA and protein levels was higher in tumor regions from CCl4+EtOH Aldh2−/− mice vs. WT mice (Fig. 3E).

SECTION

Aldh2 deficiency exacerbates DNA damage, oxidized mtDNA formation, hepatocyte senescence after CCl4+EtOH treatment

PARAGRAPH

To address the mechanism between Aldh2 deficiency and alcohol-associated HCC, we further studied oxidative stress-induced DNA damage response by measuring the expression of γH2AX, a sensitive marker for damaged DNAs.23

As illustrated in Fig. 4A, in non-tumor region, γH2AX protein levels were greater in Aldh2-deficient mice than those in WT mice; γH2AX protein levels in tumor regions were higher than in WT non-tumor region although no differences between Aldh2−/− and WT groups.

Immunohistochemistry analyses further confirmed greater γH2AX foci number in non-tumor regions from Aldh2−/− mice vs. WT mice.

Moreover, the increased γH2AX expression in CCl4+EtOH-treated Aldh2-deficient mice was detected in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 4A), but not in mice only treated with CCl4 (Fig. S6A).

Moreover, the expression of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (Atm), which encodes a protein that phosphorylates γH2AX in response to DNA double-strand breaks, was greater in Aldh2-deficient non-tumor regions; whereas the expression of oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (Ogg1), excised base repairing gene, was downregulated (Fig. 4B).

PARAGRAPH

Oncogenic/oxidative stress-derived DNA damage is a common mediator for cellular senescence24 and is known to promote the generation of neoplastic cells.6

Thus, we examined cellular senescence and found that after CCl4+EtOH, cellular senescence was significantly induced compared to normal liver tissues as illustrated by the alterations of several genes involved in cellular senescence pathways (Fig. 4C).

In addition, the number of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) positive cells, and mRNA levels of P21 and P53 were higher in liver tissues from Aldh2−/− mice vs. WT mice after CCl4+EtOH (Fig. 4D).

Furthermore, mRNA expression of Il1b, Il6 and Ccl2, known as common pro-inflammatory cytokines of senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP),25 were also higher in CCl4+EtOH-treated Aldh2−/− mice vs. WT mice (Fig. 4D).

PARAGRAPH

To model the effect of CCl4+EtOH treatment in vivo, hepatocyte damage was induced in vitro by incubating with CCl4+EtOH.

Such treatment induced higher levels of γH2AX in Aldh2−/− hepatocytes than in WT hepatocytes; but no differences were observed in CCl4 alone group (Fig. 4E).

In addition, the expression of anti-oxidant mRNA levels (Sod1, Sod2, and catalase 1) was lower whereas expression of senescence-associated genes (P21, P53, Ccl2, and Il6) was higher in CCl4+EtOH-treated Aldh2−/− hepatocytes than in WT hepatocytes (Fig. 4F, Fig. S6B).

PARAGRAPH

Finally, CYP2E1 has been implicated in tumorigenesis by processing pro-carcinogen into carcinogen.26

However, hepatic CYP2E1 protein levels were comparable between WT and Aldh2−/− mice (Fig. S6C), suggesting that the increased susceptibility of Aldh2-deficient mice to CCl4+EtOH-induced HCC is not due to the CYP2E1 alternations.

SECTION

Aldh2-deficient hepatocytes produce higher levels of oxidized mtDNA-enriched EVs than WT hepatocytes after CCl4+EtOH

PARAGRAPH

To further confirm that Aldh2-deficient hepatocytes are more susceptible to CCl4+EtOH-induced DNA damage, we measured the major oxidative DNA-damage product 8-OhDG.27

As illustrated in Fig. 5A, hepatic 8-OhDG levels in non-tumor tissues as well as serum 8-OhDG levels were significantly higher in CCl4+EtOH-treated Aldh2−/− mice vs. WT mice.

PARAGRAPH

EVs are known to play an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by excreting harmful mtDNA from cells,28 and senescent cells are known to produce more EV.29

Therefore, we hypothesized that Aldh2−/− hepatocytes remove these harmful oxidized mtDNA via EVs.

First, we detected mtDNA in EVs and found that the EVs from CCl4+EtOH-treated Aldh2−/− mice showed greater mtDNA copy numbers than those from WT mice (Fig. S7A).

Second, the concentration of EVs from Aldh2−/− mouse serum or Aldh2−/− hepatocyte cultured medium was greater than that of WT (Fig. 5B, Fig. S7B).

In addition, the size and morphology of isolated EVs were confirmed by NanoSight tracking and electron microscopy and western blot analysis of EV marker proteins (Hsp70 and TSG101) (Fig. 5B).

Furthermore, the serum-derived-EVs from CCl4+EtOH-treated mice were enriched with mtDNA (Cyto C ox, D-loop, and Nd1), but contained low levels of nuclear DNA (Gapdh) (Fig. 5C).

Hepatocyte-specific protein CYP2E1 was also detected in EVs from CCl4+EtOH-treated mice (Fig. S7B), suggesting that these EVs are mainly derived from damaged hepatocytes.

Finally, flow cytometric analyses revealed that EVs from CCl4+EtOH-treated Aldh2−/− mice or from Aldh2−/− hepatocytes contained much higher levels of 8-OhDG+ EV fraction than those of WT mice or WT hepatocytes (Fig. 5D, Fig. S7C).

PARAGRAPH

EV number was reported to be positively correlated with serum ALT levels.30,31

However, our above data show that serum ALT levels were lower but EV concentration was higher in Aldh2−/− compared to WT mice after CCl4+EtOH.

The lower ALT levels in Aldh2−/− mice may be due to greater levels of BCL-2 expression in these mice vs. WT mice (as shown in Fig. 2C), the higher levels of EVs may be due to greater levels of ROS in Aldh2−/− mice vs. WT mice because anti-oxidant treatment reduced EV production in CCl4+EtOH-treated hepatocytes (Fig. S7D).

PARAGRAPH

The above data suggest that damaged hepatocytes can secrete damage DNA via EVs.

Then we asked whether HCC can engulf these EVs.

To validate the bio-distribution of EVs, we injected mice with fluorescent-labelled EVs and found that tumor regions had much higher fluorescent intensity than normal/non-tumor liver regions (Fig. 5E).

Furthermore, EV engulfment related genes were significantly higher in Aldh2−/− mouse liver tumor tissues vs. non-tumor regions (Fig. 5F).

In addition, after in vitro incubation with fluorescent-labelled EVs, HCC cells engulfed more EVs than primary hepatocytes, as demonstrated by greater reduction of the fluorescence-intensity in cultured medium (Fig. S7E).

Collectively, these findings suggest that HCC cells engulf more EVs than primary hepatocytes.

SECTION

Acetaldehyde and oxidized mtDNA-enriched EVs synergistically activate multiple oncogenic pathways in HCC

PARAGRAPH

The above data suggest that Aldh2-deficient hepatocytes produce higher levels of oxidized mtDNA-enriched EVs, which can be engulfed by HCC cells.

To examine the effects of these EVs on HCC, we treated HepG2 cells (with or without acetaldehyde) with serum EVs from CCl4+EtOH-treated WT or Aldh2−/− mice.

As illustrated in Fig. 6A, treatment with Aldh2−/− EVs and acetaldehyde synergistically induced higher levels of ROS production, H2O2 generation, and greater gene expression levels of TAZ, CTGF, and BCL-2 compared to treatment with EVs from WT mice; whereas treatment with EVs or acetaldehyde alone had mild or no effects on these values.

PARAGRAPH

Because oxidized mtDNA was enriched in these EVs, we next determined if oxidized DNA such as 8-OhDG DNA contributed to these effects by EVs observed in Fig. 6A. First, we extracted 8-OhDG+ DNA from EVs and incubated with these DNA in HepG2 cells, and found 8-OhDG+ DNA and acetaldehyde synergistically upregulated TAZ and CTGF mRNA levels in HepG2 cells (Fig. 6B).

Second, we treated HepG2 with synthetic 8-OhDG DNA with or without acetaldehyde and found that synthetic 8-OhDG DNA treatment elevated the production of ROS and H2O2 levels in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of acetaldehyde (Fig. 6C).

Such effects were not seen in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 6C) or murine hepatocyte cell line AML12 (Fig. S8).

Finally, 8-OhDG and acetaldehyde synergistically upregulated the expression of TAZ, CTGF and BCL-2 mRNAs (Fig. 6D) as well as the expression of TAZ and phosphorylated JNK, P38, and STAT3 proteins in HepG2 cells (Fig. 6E).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In the current study, by analyzing our human data of ALDH2 polymorphisms in 646 patients with HBV-related chronic liver disease, we found that ALDH2 deficiency conferred an increased risk of HCC development in cirrhotic patients with HBV who drank alcohol, but not in those who did not drink.

To model this condition, we induced liver fibrosis in mice using CCl4 followed by alcohol treatment and tested this model in 3 lines of Aldh2-deficient mice.

Our data revealed that Aldh2-deficient mice were more susceptible to HCC development induced by CCl4+EtOH.

Such increased risk of HCC development in Aldh2-deficient mice after alcohol consumption is likely due to elevated acetaldehyde given acetaldehyde is a carcinogen that can cause DNA damage and mutagenesis, resulting in activation of the oncogenic pathway IL-6/STA318 and tumor transformation.1

Both chronic CCl4 administration and acetaldehyde have been shown to induce genomic DNA damage,32,33 which may induce tumor initiation.

Therefore, tumor initiation via genomic DNA damage induced by both CCl4 and acetaldehyde likely contribute to the HCC development in this CCl4+EtOH model in Aldh2−/− mice.

In addition to these mechanisms, we also identified the novel mechanism by demonstrating the cross-talk between Aldh2-deficient hepatocytes and HCC via the transfer of oxidized mtDNA.

Aldh2-deficient hepatocytes produce a greater number of EVs enriched with oxidized mtDNA than WT hepatocytes, which was likely due to CCl4+EtOH induction of greater levels of DNA damage in these cells than in WT cells.

Another mechanism may be because of greater levels of cellular senescence from Aldh2-deficient hepatocytes compared to WT hepatocytes given cellular senescence is known to accelerate EV secretion.29

PARAGRAPH

Among the oxidized DNAs, 8-OhDG is one of the major products of DNA oxidation and has been widely used as a biomarker for oxidative stress and carcinogenesis.27

Although 8-OhDG as a biomarker and risk factor for cancer development has been well documented, whether and how 8-OhDG contributes to alcohol-associated HCC development remain obscure.

In the current study, we demonstrated that damaged Aldh2-deficient hepatocytes from CCl4+EtOH exposure excreted much higher levels of 8-OhDG via EVs than WT hepatocytes.

These harmful 8-OhDG-enriched EVs can be engulfed by HCC cells as demonstrated by in vivo and in vitro experiments with labelled EVs.

The mechanisms by which HCCs engulfed more EVs than primary hepatocytes are not clear but may be due to the increased expression of EVs engulfment related genes in HCCs as demonstrated in this study.

Importantly, we also demonstrated that treatment of HCC cells with 8-OhDG together with acetaldehyde induced activation of multiple oncogenic pathways that are known to promote HCC, including STAT3,10,11 JNK,12,13 TAZ,14,15 and BCL-2.16,17

Such activation is likely induced, at least in part, by oxidative stress induced by 8-OhDG and acetaldehyde given oxidative stress is well-known to activate these oncogenic pathways.34

Interestingly, 8-OhDG plus acetaldehyde-mediated activation of oxidative stress and multiple oncogenic pathways was only observed in HCCs but not in primary hepatocytes.

The underlying mechanisms for this are not clear and it may be related to the fact that compared to HCC, primary hepatocytes express higher levels of anti-oxidant genes and ALDH2, which ameliorate ethanol-induced oxidative stress.

PARAGRAPH

Another interesting finding from this study was that TAZ but not YAP was activated in Aldh2−/− tumors from CCl4+EtOH-treated mice and in 8-OhDG+acetaldehyde-treated hepatocytes although both TAZ and YAP are downstream transcription factors in Hippo pathway with largely overlapping functions including promoting HCC progression.14,15

A recent study revealed that oxidative stress-induced reversible S-glutathionylation at conserved cysteine residues within TAZ but not YAP, which subsequently increases TAZ protein stability and promotes TAZ activation.35

This may explain why TAZ not YAP is markedly elevated in CCl4+EtOH-treated Aldh2−/− HCC vs. WT HCC given greater ROS in Aldh2−/− than in WT HCC.

PARAGRAPH

In summary, our study demonstrated that oxidized DNA-enriched EVs and acetaldehyde synergistically contribute to the development of alcohol-associated HCC, suggesting that inhibition of oxidized mtDNA-enriched EV production could be a novel therapeutic strategy for ameliorating alcohol-associated HCC in ALDH2-deficient individuals.
