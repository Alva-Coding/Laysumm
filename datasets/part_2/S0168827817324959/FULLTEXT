TITLE

Plectin controls biliary tree architecture and stability in cholestasis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

The biliary tree is a complex three-dimensional (3D) tubular network that drains the bile produced by hepatocytes to the small intestine.

The bile is secreted into the bile canaliculi and flows through interconnected small and large bile ducts (BDs), which are lined with cuboidal biliary epithelial cells (BECs).

Disorders affecting the function of BECs underlie diverse cholangiopathies (e.g. primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis), often characterized by cholestatic condition.1

Biliary obstructions elicit a toxic response, and increased biliary pressure leads to epithelial ruptures and leakage of bile into the parenchyma.

In response to a subsequent hepatocellular injury, BECs and hepatic progenitor cells (termed the oval cells in rodents) start to proliferate in a “ductular reaction”.

Their expansion gives rise to an increased number of biliary ductules.

Thus, by forming a significantly denser duct meshwork around the portal vein, the biliary system adapts to effectively drain the accumulated biliary fluid.

PARAGRAPH

A prominent group of genes that becomes upregulated in response to a cholestatic insult encodes keratins.2–4

In the liver, both hepatocytes and BECs express keratins (K) 8 and 18, whereas only BECs additionally contain K7, K19 and K23.4,5

Mutations in keratin genes resulting in unstable and abnormally organized keratin filaments (KFs) predispose their carriers to various liver diseases, including cholangiopathies.6,7

Mouse models that either lack or mimic mutant human K8 or K18 show increased fragility of hepatocytes, increased necrosis and hemorrhage with subsequent lethality (as reviewed in8).

Although little is known about biliary keratins, an attenuated ductular reaction and aggravated cholestatic injury upon targeted inactivation of K199 suggest their critical role in biliary epithelium.

PARAGRAPH

Proper organization of intermediate filament (IF) networks is maintained by cytoskeletal linker proteins (cytolinkers) of the plakin protein family.

Plectin, a prototypical ubiquitously expressed cytolinker, crosslinks IFs and anchors them at junctional complexes, including hemidesmosomes (HDs) and desmosomes (Ds) of epithelial cells.10

In addition, plectin binds to actomyosin and microtubule network systems, thus affecting not only mechanical but also dynamic properties of the cytoskeleton.

Multiple studies have shown that the deletion of plectin leads to aberrant KF organization11,12 manifesting as more bundled and less flexible filaments.11

Without plectin, KF networks are less stable and more prone to collapse under both mechanical and non-mechanical stress conditions.11

The absence of a plectin-mediated IF anchorage has been found to alter the structure and functionality of junctional complexes.12–15

For instance, homeostasis and stability of HDs in keratinocytes is strictly dependent on plectin-mediated KF recruitment,15 and a reduction in the number of HDs and their dysfunction are directly linked to skin fragility.12,15

Similarly, a tissue-specific plectin deletion in mouse endothelium has adverse effects on the formation of adherens and tight junctions (AJs and TJs) with consequences for endothelial barrier function.13

PARAGRAPH

The overall objective of this study was to determine how plectin controls KF networks in the liver and how it contributes to their hepatoprotective roles.

Our results demonstrate an absolute plectin requirement for maintaining proper biliary tree architecture and epithelial stability in cholestatic injury.

Results

SECTION

Plectin colocalizes with KFs and junctional complex proteins in mouse liver epithelial cells

PARAGRAPH

Early on plectin was shown to be abundantly expressed in the liver and to prominently associate with canaliculi.21

To study the localization of plectin in more detail, we subjected mouse liver paraffin sections to immunofluorescence microscopy.

In both hepatocytes and BECs, plectin clearly delineated cell boundaries, where it partially colocalized with pan-keratin (pan-K) positive IFs (Fig. 1A).

Plectin also showed extensive colocalization with the tight junction (TJ) protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1, Fig. 1B) and the AJ protein E-Cadherin (Fig. S1) at the surface of BECs and bile canaliculi.

As plectin was reported to protect KF cytoarchitecture from various types of stress,11 we analyzed whether plectin expression was upregulated in two liver injury mouse models.

We observed substantially increased expression of plectin at both mRNA and protein levels in livers subjected to BDL or in DDC-fed animals (Fig. 1C, D).

In line with previous findings3,22 the upregulation was paralleled by an increase in K18 and K19 expression (Fig. 1C, D).

Together, these results suggest a potential involvement of plectin in response to a cholestatic liver disease.

SECTION

Liver-specific plectin deficiency leads to aberrant organization of epithelial KFs

PARAGRAPH

To explore the role of plectin in liver epithelium, we generated liver-specific plectin knockout (PleΔalb) mice (see Materials and Methods).

A successful ablation of plectin in liver epithelium was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy and plectin expression analysis (Fig. S2).

Under physiological conditions, PleΔalb mice display no signs of gross pathology, as we observed normal serum liver enzyme levels (Fig. S3) and detected no obvious histological abnormalities (Fig. S4).

Moreover, no significant changes were found in either the biliary bile acid composition, expression of bile acid transporters and receptors or bile flow rates (Fig. 2A–D).

PARAGRAPH

As plectin acts as a major organizer of keratin cytoarchitecture,11 we compared the appearance of KFs in Plefl/fl and PleΔalb liver sections by immunofluorescence microscopy.

In Plefl/fl hepatocytes, K8 and K18 displayed a mostly perimembraneous staining pattern, whereas in PleΔalb cells, KFs were evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A, B; see also 3D reconstruction in Fig. S5A and Videos S1 and S2).

In contrast to hepatocytes, the general appearance of the K18 and K19 staining patterns did not significantly differ between PleΔalb and Plefl/fl BECs (Fig. 3C, D).

However, quantitative fluorescence microscopy revealed that the absence of plectin resulted in a decrease of K18 fluorescence intensity at the apical membrane, accompanied by an increase of K19 fluorescence intensity at the basal membrane, leading to a partial loss of typically polarized keratin cytoarchitecture (Fig. 3C, D; box plot graphs).

This was further clearly discernible from 3D reconstruction analysis of pan-K-immunolabelled BECs (Fig. S5B).

Similar trends were observed for their type II pairing partners K8 and K7 (Fig. S6A,B).

The changes observed in KF localization were not a consequence of altered keratin expression levels, as no differences were found by immunoblotting liver lysates (Fig. 3E, S6C).

Thus, plectin deficiency results in cytosolic localization of KFs in hepatocytes and in the redistribution of apicobasal localization of KFs in PleΔalb BECs, affecting KF cytoarchitecture in these cells.

SECTION

PleΔalb mice show malformations of interlobular BDs and ductules accompanied by ductular reaction

PARAGRAPH

The plectin-mediated IF network anchorage is known to impart mechanical stability on cells required to maintain proper tissue architecture.15,16

To determine the ductular luminal shape, we performed a morphometric analysis of K19-immunolabelled intralobular BDs and luminized ductules in 4- and 12-week-old mice.

Strikingly, both BDs and ductules in PleΔalb mice showed a reduction in the cross-sectional luminal area, while no differences in the luminal perimeter were detected (Fig. 4A).

When the luminal shape was quantified by calculating the circularity and the axial ratio (see Materials and Methods), both parameters indicated significantly irregular and rather elongated ductular lumens in PleΔalb livers compared to more rounded lumens in Plefl/fl livers (Fig. 4A).

This phenotype was not aggravated with aging as seen from morphometric analysis of luminized structures of 20- and 40-week-old mice (Fig. S7).

Ductular dysmorphology was paralleled by a prominent increase in the number of ductules and K19-positive (K19+) cells per portal field in PleΔalb livers (Fig. 4B), while the numbers of interlobular BDs and individual K19+ cells remained unchanged compared to Plefl/fl livers (Fig. 4B, S8A).

A further analysis showed a comparable content of A6-positive (A6+) progenitors/oval cells in Plefl/fl and PleΔalb livers (Fig. S8B).

These findings suggest that under physiological conditions, aberrant KF cytoarchitecture in plectin-deficient BECs leads to collapse of ductular lumens and to a mild ductular reaction.

SECTION

Plectin is responsible for a proper canalicular network formation in the liver

PARAGRAPH

Given the ductular dysmorphology in PleΔalb livers we next assessed whether plectin deficiency also affects the canalicular formation.

In sharp contrast to regularly shaped bile canaliculi in Plefl/fl livers (Fig. 4C, S8C), scanning electron microscopy of PleΔalb livers showed distorted, wider, and more meandering bile canaliculi with frequent blind end loops (Fig. 4C and S8C).

A quantitative analysis of canalicular morphology revealed a significantly wider range of canalicular widths in PleΔalb compared to Plefl/fl livers (Fig. 4C).

An analysis of 3D reconstructions of ZO-1-immunolabelled sections confirmed partially dilated, more meandering and prominently misshaped bile canaliculi in PleΔalb livers (Fig. 4D).

Further, an increased number of branching points indicated denser canalicular networks.

Immunofluorescence microscopy of F-actin-labelled collagen sandwich cultures of Plefl/fl and PleΔalb primary hepatocytes18 revealed highly irregular and significantly wider PleΔalb canaliculi with grossly dilated segments (Fig. 4E), which closely resembled abnormalities seen in a canalicular PleΔalb network in vivo.

SECTION

Plectin deficiency aggravates BDL-induced liver injury

PARAGRAPH

To assess whether the prominent upregulation of plectin expression upon cholestatic challenge (Fig. 1D) was indicative of its protective role during injury, we subjected Plefl/fl and PleΔalb mice to BDL for 5 and 14 days.

We observed similar levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total serum bile acid (tBA), but higher total bilirubin levels in PleΔalb compared to Plefl/fl mice (Fig. 5A, B, S9A).

A histological analysis of liver sections after 14 days of BDL showed significantly increased numbers of bile infarcts and larger areas of necrotic tissue in PleΔalb compared to Plefl/fl livers (Fig. 5C).

PleΔalb livers also showed more extensive fibrosis, as revealed by a morphometric analysis of Sirius red-stained liver sections and immunoblot analyses for collagen I and α-smooth muscle actin (Fig. 5D, S9B).

Ductular reaction, assessed by a histological evaluation of K19+ areas on liver sections and an immunoblot analysis of liver lysates, was similar in Plefl/fl and PleΔalb mice after both 5 and 14 days of BDL (Fig. S9C).

Nonetheless, Ki-67 staining revealed significantly higher BEC proliferation in PleΔalb mice after 14 days of injury (Fig. 5E).

Coincidently, A6 antigen staining showed approximately twofold increase in the progenitor cell area in PleΔalb mice after both 5 and 14 days of BDL (Fig. 5F).

Together these data show higher susceptibility of PleΔalb mice to BDL-induced injury accompanied by more severe portal fibrosis with considerable BEC and oval cell proliferation.

SECTION

Plectin is required in recovery from DDC-induced injury

PARAGRAPH

As BDL-induced cholestasis affects primarily large BD epithelial cells,23 next we studied the role of plectin in a second model of cholestasis that affects primarily small BDs.24

In line with the results from the BDL model, 14 days of DDC-feeding resulted in slightly higher ALP and bilirubin levels in PleΔalb compared to the levels in Plefl/fl mice, pointing to more extensive biliary epithelial damage.

On the other hand, a significantly attenuated elevation of ALT and tBA levels in PleΔalb mice suggested unexpectedly lower hepatocellular injury (Fig. 6A, B).

This coincided with less extensive fibrosis in PleΔalb mice assessed from Sirius red-stained liver sections (Fig. 6C).

The extent of the ductular reaction and the proliferative response to DDC-induced injury was comparable in both genotypes, as no differences were found in K19+ area, K19 expression levels, and Ki-67 staining (Fig. S10A–C).

In sharp contrast, we observed a more than threefold increase in the A6+ progenitor cell area in PleΔalb mice (Fig. 6D).

These findings indicate that in this model the genetic loss of plectin increases the susceptibility of BECs to DDC intoxication and leads to a substantially elevated activation of oval cells, but has a protective effect on hepatic parenchyma.

PARAGRAPH

To study whether plectin deficiency affects the ability of the liver to regenerate after cholestatic injury, mice fed for 14 days with DDC were allowed three days of standard chow to recover.

After the recovery period, ALT, ALP, and bilirubin levels decreased in both Plefl/fl and PleΔalb mice; however, the recovery levels were significantly higher in PleΔalb than in Plefl/fl mice (Fig. 6A).

Moreover, while serum tBA levels in Plefl/fl mice were five-times lower after recovery, in PleΔalb mice they stayed as high as during the injury period (Fig. 6B).

Consistently, we also observed persisting fibrosis in these animals (Fig. 6C).

Similar to the injury period, both Plefl/fl and PleΔalb mice showed a comparable ductular reaction and a proliferative response (Fig. S10A–C) with no significant differences in the number of A6+ cells (Fig. 6D).

Collectively, these results show that although DDC exposure leads to lower hepatocellular damage in PleΔalb mice, its resolution is slower, strongly suggesting that plectin provides the liver with the capability to recover from DDC-induced injury more efficiently.

SECTION

Plectin preserves BD integrity under BDL-induced cholestatic stress

PARAGRAPH

Aberrant KF cytoarchitecture of PleΔalb BECs associated with collapse of ductular structures and a worse outcome of BDL injury led us to assess the BD appearance in livers upon BDL challenge.

A morphometric analysis of liver sections immunolabelled for pan-K and E-Cadherin revealed that intralobular BDs of Plefl/fl mice after 14 days of BDL were mostly round with their lumens formed by tightly packed BECs with the nuclear long axis perpendicular to the ductal wall (Fig. 7A, S11A).

In contrast, PleΔalb BDs showed significantly larger luminal areas (Fig. 7A) surrounded by loosely packed BECs that were often misaligned and had lost their polarized orientation (Fig. 7A, S11B).

More dilated and round stress-loaded BDs in PleΔalb BDL-injured livers were in stark contrast to untreated BDs, where plectin deficiency led to luminal collapse (Fig. 4A).

Together, these observations likely reflected reduced stability of PleΔalb ducts resulting in a prominent dilatation upon BDL-induced bile pressure.

Moreover, PleΔalb BDs displayed more ruptures (Fig. 7A) corresponding to aggravated BDL-induced liver injury (Fig. 5).

This further confirmed the fragility of plectin-deficient biliary epithelium.

We did not observe any comparable changes in the cross-sectional luminal area and in BD morphology in DDC-treated animals (Fig. S11B).

PARAGRAPH

As the cohesion of BECs is maintained by junctional complexes, we compared morphology of TJs, AJs, and Ds formed by unchallenged Plefl/fl and PleΔalb BECs using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

Quantitative analyses showed a significantly reduced length of TJs in PleΔalb liver, but no apparent differences in the appearance of AJs and Ds (Fig. 7B).

A further analysis revealed that the expression levels of the desmosomal proteins desmoglein and desmoplakin as well as their localizations were comparable between unchallenged Plefl/fl and PleΔalb livers (Fig. 7E, F and not shown).

However, PleΔalb liver lysates showed an ∼50% increase in E-Cadherin protein levels (Fig. 7D), which was not accompanied by any obvious changes in AJ morphology (Fig. S12A).

Although these results suggest a distortion of biliary cell-cell junctions and a possible impairment of the biliary barrier, we observed no penetration of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (4 and 40 kDa) from blood to bile (Fig. S12B, C).

Given our findings in BDL-treated PleΔalb mice, we further quantified the expression levels of junctional proteins by immunoblotting (Fig. 7C–F).

In line with previous findings,2 BDL caused a general upregulation of these proteins.

No significant differences were observed for ZO-1, E-Cadherin and desmoglein expressions between PleΔalb and Plefl/fl mice (Fig. 7C–E).

In contrast, BDL induced an upregulation of desmoplakin to a significantly lesser extent in PleΔalb than in Plefl/fl mice (Fig. 7F).

These results clearly show that plectin deficiency leads to a considerable distortion of biliary cell-cell contacts and compromises the ability of BDs to cope with BDL insult.

SECTION

Plectin stabilizes KFs under stress and affects the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway in liver epithelial cells

PARAGRAPH

Previous studies have linked the resilience to cholestatic injury with KF network stability.3,25

Given the changes in KF organization in PleΔalb livers, we assessed their reorganization in response to stress conditions in liver epithelial cells.

Immunofluorescence microscopy for K8 on liver sections after 5 and 14 days of BDL, revealed, as previously reported,3,25 an increase in the density of the KF network (not shown).

Additionally, we found single hepatocytes containing K8+ aggregates, which were 1.5-times more abundant in PleΔalb than in Plefl/fl livers (Fig. 8A).

To confirm the role of plectin in a stress-induced KF reorganization in vitro, we treated primary hepatocytes and the mouse cholangiocyte cell line (MSC19) with the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (OA).

Untreated PleΔalb hepatocytes and plectin-deficient MSCs (KO MSCs; see Materials and Methods) showed less delicate keratin IF networks when compared to their wild-type (WT) counterparts (Fig. 8B).

After exposure to OA, KFs in KO cells formed thicker bundles and their collapse was evident from either cytoplasmic areas devoid of keratin staining (hepatocytes) or the formation of keratin granules (MSCs) (Fig. 8B).

Consistent with a higher frequency of K8+ aggregates observed in BDL-treated PleΔalb livers, KF networks were found significantly more often collapsed in OA-treated plectin-deficient than in wild-type cells (Fig. 8B).

Together, these data suggest that plectin stabilizes KFs under stress conditions both in vitro and in vivo.

PARAGRAPH

The reorganization of KFs is known to be mediated via MAP kinase p38,26 a stress-response kinase also implicated in the cholestatic liver disease.27

As our previous data suggested a plectin-dependent regulation of the p38 signaling pathway,11 we examined whether the changes in KF appearance upon BDL or OA treatment were paralleled by p38 activation.

Using anti-phospho-p38 antibodies, we found significantly lower p38 activities in PleΔalb compared to Plefl/fl liver lysates from sham-operated mice (Fig. 8C).

Surprisingly, this downregulation was not confirmed in vitro; the basal phosphorylation of p38 kinase did not differ between plectin-deficient and wild-type hepatocytes or MSCs (Fig. 8D, E).

As expected, BDL resulted in p38 activation, which was substantially elevated in PleΔalb livers despite its comparatively low levels under basal conditions (Fig. 8C).

Consistent with these results, p38 phosphorylation was found to be higher both in OA-treated plectin-deficient hepatocytes and in MSCs compared to their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 8D, E).

Hence, the enhanced stress-induced activation of p38 kinase correlated well with the increased fragility of the IF networks observed in plectin-deficient liver epithelial cells.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this study, we show that plectin plays an essential role in the proper organization of KF networks in both hepatocytes as well as in BECs.

In the absence of plectin, hepatocytic keratins K8 and K18 no longer showed their typical distribution along the plasma membrane, but loose individual filaments were found scattered throughout the whole cytoplasmic space.

In BECs, where plectin deficiency showed a less dramatic effect, an apicobasal redistribution of the keratin network was observed.

Besides these changes in the KF organization, plectin deficiency also led to the dysregulation of cell-cell contacts in biliary epithelium.

Plectin-deficient BECs formed shorter TJs, and higher expression levels of the AJ marker protein E-Cadherin were found in PleΔalb livers.

Despite a partial loss of cytoarchitecture polarity and aberrant cell-cell junctions in BECs, PleΔalb mice showed no defects in bile formation or composition.

In line with similar findings in mice lacking K8/K1828 or K19,9 these results suggest that under physiological conditions localization of membrane transporter and receptor proteins is unaffected and biliary epithelium is intact in PleΔalb mice.

PARAGRAPH

Our extensive scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed a denser network of distorted, wider and more meandering bile canaliculi formed by adjacent plectin-deficient compared to wild-type hepatocytes in Plefl/fl livers.

As no similar observations have been reported in mice deficient for individual keratins,9,28 it is unlikely that bile canalicular abnormalities seen in PleΔalb mice and 3D cultures of primary plectin-deficient hepatocytes can be attributed to an altered KF networks per se.

However, prior studies have shown that plectin-controlled IF cytoarchitecture is required for actomyosin-generated cytoskeletal tension.13,29

It is noteworthy that two key tension transducers/sensors, α-catenin30 and β-catenin,31 have been independently implicated in a bile canalicular formation in vivo.

Furthermore, Li et al.32 have shown that mechanical intercellular tension guides canalicular elongation and accounts for different luminal morphologies.

Hence, we propose that an aberrant bile canalicular formation in PleΔalb mice may reflect modified mechanical properties of plectin-deficient hepatocytes as a consequence of reduced cellular mechanical tension.

Experiments to test this hypothesis, both in vivo and in vitro, are currently ongoing.

PARAGRAPH

We found that plectin deficiency leads to the destabilization of BDs and their collapse.

In line with the generally accepted view that plectin provides tissues (e.g. skin, muscle) with mechanical stability,10,15,33 BD dysmorphology is thus likely a consequence of the shear stress exerted on less stable (plectin-deficient) BECs.

Interestingly, this dysmorphology of the plectin-deficient biliary tree is paralleled by a mild ductular reaction.

Although this could be due to a local bile stasis in irregularly shaped canaliculi or ductules, we have not found any significant upregulations in ALP or bilirubin levels that would indicate cholestatic conditions in PleΔalb mice under basal conditions.

PARAGRAPH

Experimental models of cholestasis caused aggravated liver injury in PleΔalb mice.

After BDL, mechanically unstable plectin-deficient BDs significantly dilated in response to increased bile pressure, which ultimately led to more frequent BD ruptures and an increased number of bile infarcts corresponding to more severe liver injury.

Similarly to BDL, the extent of biliary damage in the DDC model was higher in PleΔalb than Plefl/fl mice; however, parenchyma damage was only modest in PleΔalb mice.

This likely reflects the fact that DDC affects primarily small ducts,24 which are less prone to hepatobiliary injury.34

Furthermore, reduced liver injury in PleΔalb mice is consistent with the observation that DDC induced upregulation of plectin expression to a much lesser extent than BDL.

This suggests that plectin is not required for the reorganization of KF cytoarchitecture25 under DDC-induced cholestasis.

However, slower recovery from DDC-induced liver injury indicates that plectin has the capacity to repair periportal damage associated with DDC exposure.

PARAGRAPH

Interestingly, PleΔalb mice had also higher serum levels of liver injury markers in cholic acid (CA)-induced cholestasis model35 (not shown).

Although plectin-deficient hepatocytes show unaltered transporter systems under physiological conditions, observation from the CA-based experiment implies that they might have limited capacity to overcome bile acid overload.

To elucidate underlying plectin-related mechanisms and to find their contribution to the BDL- and DDC-induced phenotypes is a goal for our ongoing studies.

PARAGRAPH

Although both BDL and DDC cholestatic models yielded aggravated liver injury in PleΔalb mice, the extent of the injury was surprisingly mild, given the reduced mechanical stability of plectin-deficient BDs.

This unexpected observation could be attributed to a ductular reaction occurring in response to plectin ablation under basal conditions.

A resulting denser meshwork with an increased number of ductules could more effectively drain bile under experimental cholestasis, thus constituting a “pre-adaptation” of the PleΔalb bile tree, which partially mitigates cholestatic insult.

PARAGRAPH

We observed a significant expansion of A6+ progenitor cells in PleΔalb livers in both models of cholestasis.

Surprisingly, this was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in K19+ cells, likely indicating a lack of oval cell differentiation in these models.

As K19 KO mice on a DDC diet display an attenuated ductular reaction and hampered oval cell proliferation,9 the role of plectin in oval cell induction and expansion appears to be KF-independent.

Further studies are required to find out i) whether plectin directly regulates progenitor proliferation and differentiation, ii) whether the overactivation of oval cells attenuates liver damage, and iii) what is the impact of plectin deficiency in long-term DDC-induced liver injury.

PARAGRAPH

Strong upregulation of plectin in models of cholestatic challenge and increased liver damage of PleΔalb mice suggest that the role of plectin is hepatoprotective.

Interestingly, an upregulation in response to cholestatic challenge has been described for keratins (K8/K18,36K19,9K234) and other plakins such as epiplakin25 and periplakin,2 i.e. proteins that are required for the maintenance of mechanical stability of cells and tissues.

Besides proteins directly linked to cytoarchitecture and cell mechanics, liver epithelial cells also conjointly upregulate constituents of cell-cell junctions,2,37 structures that are essential for intercellular cohesion.

This implies an intriguing possibility that overexpression of these proteins constitutes a complex adaptive response to cholestasis, which provides biliary epithelium with resilience against increased bile pressure.

Here we show that apart from perturbing the KF organization of hepatocytes and BECs, plectin deficiency leads to distortion of TJs, accompanied by the upregulation of the AJ protein E-Cadherin.

Moreover, PleΔalb mice fail to induce upregulation of desmoplakin, a proposed direct binding partner of plectin,38 which mediates the anchorage of keratin IFs to desmosomes.

Although these changes do not directly hamper the biliary barrier of PleΔalb mice, they provide strong evidence that plectin maintains the stability of biliary epithelium and facilitates adaptive reorganization of cytoarchitecture and cell-cell cohesion.

PARAGRAPH

Prior studies have demonstrated that KF networks exert non-mechanical functions, providing epithelial cells with protection against deformation-unrelated stress.

Previously, we have shown that plectin-deficient keratinocytes increase the p38 MAP kinase activity in response to OA-induced stress, and we proposed a feedback loop between plectin-organized KFs and p38 activation leading to overactivation of p38 under stress condition.11

In addition, plectin scaffolds and regulates the activity of AMPK,14 a key sensor of metabolic stress which stabilizes tight junctions, preserves cell polarity, and thereby maintains epithelial barrier functions.39

Showing higher stress-induced upregulation of p38 activity in both plectin-deficient liver (cholestasis) and primary hepatocytes (OA treatment), our results clearly indicate the role of plectin in the p38-mediated stress response in liver epithelia.

Plectin’s control of cytoskeletal integrity and its interplay with signaling pathways thus emerges as a critical determinant of the biliary barrier.

Further studies are needed to delineate precise underlying mechanisms and their roles in the development and progression of human liver diseases.
