TITLE

Plectin controls biliary tree architecture and stability in cholestasis

PARAGRAPH

Plectin is a cytolinker protein capable of interconnecting all three cytoskeletal filament systems and linking them to plasma membrane-bound junctional complexes.

In liver, the plectin-controlled cytoskeleton mechanically stabilizes epithelial cells and provides them with the capacity to adapt to increased bile pressure under cholestasis.
