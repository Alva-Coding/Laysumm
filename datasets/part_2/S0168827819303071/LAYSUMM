TITLE

A pilot study of safety and efficacy of HCV retreatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir in patients with or without HIV (RESOLVE STUDY)

PARAGRAPH

Twelve weeks of the combination of direct-acting antivirals (SOF/VEL/VOX) was safe and effective in patients with relapsed hepatitis C virus infection who had previously received combination therapy with direct-acting antivirals.

Treatment response was not diminished by HIV coinfection, or non-completion of previous direct-acting antiviral-based therapy.
