ABSTRACT

TITLE

A pilot study of safety and efficacy of HCV retreatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir in patients with or without HIV (RESOLVE STUDY)

PARAGRAPH

Cure rates in response to retreatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX) are high, but this regimen has not been studied in patients with a history of poor adherence or treatment interruption, nor in patients with HIV/HCV coinfection.

Herein, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of this combination in patients with genotype 1 HCV infection who had relapsed following combination direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, regardless of HIV infection or previous treatment course.

PARAGRAPH

The RESOLVE study was a multicenter, open-label, phase IIb study investigating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of SOF/VEL/VOX in 77 patients with virologic rebound following combination DAA therapy.

Efficacy was defined as HCV RNA below the lower limit of detection 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12), while safety endpoints included the incidence of grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs) following treatment, and the proportion of patients who stopped treatment prematurely due to AEs.

PARAGRAPH

In an intent-to-treat analysis, 70/77 (90.9%, 95% CI 82.1â€“95.8%) patients achieved SVR12, including 14/17 (82.4%) HIV coinfected participants and 18/22 (81.8%) of those with previous non-completion of DAA therapy.

In an analysis of all patients who completed 12 weeks of study medication, 70/71 patients (99%) achieved SVR12.

One patient experienced a grade 3 AE, and 4 experienced a grade 4 AE, all unrelated to study participation.

Reported AEs were similar in HIV-coinfected patients, and patients receiving dolutegravir-based antiretroviral treatment experienced no clinically significant increases in aminotransferases.

PARAGRAPH

Retreatment with 12 weeks of SOF/VEL/VOX was safe and effective in patients with relapsed HCV following initial combination DAA-based treatment.

Treatment response was not affected by HIV coinfection or previous treatment course.
