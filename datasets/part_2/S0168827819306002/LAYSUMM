TITLE

Von Willebrand factor delays liver repair after acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury in mice

PARAGRAPH

Patients with acute liver injury due to acetaminophen overdose have highly elevated levels of the platelet-adhesive protein von Willebrand factor.

It is not known whether von Willebrand factor plays a direct role in the progression of acute liver injury.

We discovered that von Willebrand factor delays repair of the acetaminophen-injured liver in mice and that targeting von Willebrand factor, even in mice with established liver injury, accelerates liver repair.
