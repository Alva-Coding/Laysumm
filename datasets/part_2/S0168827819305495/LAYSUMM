TITLE

Clathrin switches transforming growth factor-β role to pro-tumorigenic in liver cancer

PARAGRAPH

Clathrin heavy-chain expression increases during liver tumorigenesis in humans (CLTC) and mice (Cltc), altering the cellular response to TGF-β in favour of anti-apoptotic/pro-tumorigenic signals.

A positive correlation between TGFB1 and CLTC was found in HCC cells and patients.

Patients expressing high levels of TGFB1 and CLTC had a worse prognosis and lower overall survival.

CLTC expression in HCC human samples could help select patients that would benefit from therapies targeting TGF-β.
