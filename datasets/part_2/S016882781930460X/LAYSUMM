Integrin β1-enriched extracellular vesicles mediate monocyte adhesion and promote liver inflammation in murine NASH

PARAGRAPH

Herein, we report that a cell adhesion molecule termed integrin β1 (ITGβ1) plays a key role in the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

ITGβ1 is released from hepatocytes under lipotoxic stress as a cargo of extracellular vesicles, and mediates monocyte adhesion to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, which is an essential step in hepatic inflammation.

In a mouse model of NASH, blocking ITGβ1 reduces liver inflammation, injury and fibrosis.

Hence, ITGβ1 inhibition may serve as a new therapeutic strategy for NASH.
