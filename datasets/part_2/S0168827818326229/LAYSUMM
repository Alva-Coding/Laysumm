TITLE

Metformin modulates innate immune-mediated inflammation and early progression of NAFLD-associated hepatocellular carcinoma in zebrafish

PARAGRAPH

This paper reports a new zebrafish model that can be used to study the effects of diet on liver cancer.

We found that a high-fat diet promotes non-resolving inflammation in the liver and enhances cancer progression.

In addition, we found that metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes, inhibits high-fat diet-induced cancer progression in this model, by reducing diet-induced non-resolving inflammation and potentially restoring tumor surveillance.
