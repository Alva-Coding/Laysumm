TITLE

MicroRNA-378 promotes hepatic inflammation and fibrosis via modulation of the NF-κB-TNFα pathway

PARAGRAPH

The recent epidemic of obesity has been associated with a sharp rise in the incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

However, the underlying mechanism(s) remains poorly described and effective therapeutic approaches against NAFLD are lacking.

The results establish that microRNA-378 facilitates the development of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis and suggests the therapeutic potential of microRNA-378 inhibitor for the treatment of NAFLD.
