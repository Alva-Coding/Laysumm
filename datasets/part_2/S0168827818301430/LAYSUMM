TITLE

Hepatitis D virus replication is sensed by MDA5 and induces IFN-β/λ responses in hepatocytes

PARAGRAPH

In contrast to hepatitis B virus, infection with hepatitis D virus induces a strong IFN-β/λ response in innate immune competent cell lines.

MDA5 is the key sensor for the recognition of hepatitis D virus replicative intermediates.

An IFN-activated state did not prevent hepatitis D virus replication in vitro, indicating that hepatitis D virus is resistant to self-induced innate immune responses and therapeutic IFN treatment.
