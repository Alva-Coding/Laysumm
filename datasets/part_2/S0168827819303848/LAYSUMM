TITLE

Validation, clinical utility and limitations of the Amsterdam-Oxford model for primary sclerosing cholangitis

PARAGRAPH

In our study we assessed whether the Amsterdam-Oxford model (AOM) is able to correctly estimate the risk of liver transplantation or death in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).

This model uses 7 objective and readily available variables to estimate prognosis for individual patients at the time of PSC diagnosis.

The AOM may aid in patient counselling and timing of diagnostic procedures or therapeutic interventions for complications of liver disease.

We confirm that the model works well at PSC diagnosis, but also when the AOM is recalculated at different timepoints during follow-up, greatly improving the applicability of the model in clinical practice and for individual patients.
