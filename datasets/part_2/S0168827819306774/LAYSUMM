TITLE

Early acetaminophen-protein adducts predict hepatotoxicity following overdose (ATOM-5)

PARAGRAPH

Acetaminophen poisoning is one of the most common causes of liver injury.

This study examined a new biomarker of acetaminophen toxicity, which measures the amount of toxic metabolite exposure called acetaminophen-protein adduct.

We found that those who developed liver injury had a higher initial level of acetaminophen-protein adducts than those who did not.
