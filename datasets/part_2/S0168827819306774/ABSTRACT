ABSTRACT

TITLE

Early acetaminophen-protein adducts predict hepatotoxicity following overdose (ATOM-5)

PARAGRAPH

Acetaminophen-protein adducts are specific biomarkers of toxic acetaminophen (paracetamol) metabolite exposure.

In patients with hepatotoxicity (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] >1,000 U/L), an adduct concentration ≥1.0 nmol/ml is sensitive and specific for identifying cases secondary to acetaminophen.

Our aim was to characterise acetaminophen-protein adduct concentrations in patients following acetaminophen overdose and determine if they predict toxicity.

PARAGRAPH

We performed a multicentre prospective observational study, recruiting patients 14 years of age or older with acetaminophen overdose regardless of intent or formulation.

Three serum samples were obtained within the first 24 h of presentation and analysed for acetaminophen-protein adducts.

Acetaminophen-protein adduct concentrations were compared to ALT and other indicators of toxicity.

PARAGRAPH

Of the 240 patients who participated, 204 (85%) presented following acute ingestions, with a median ingested dose of 20 g (IQR 10–40), and 228 (95%) were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine at a median time of 6 h (IQR 3.5–10.5) post-ingestion.

Thirty-six (15%) patients developed hepatotoxicity, of whom 22 had an ALT ≤1,000 U/L at the time of initial acetaminophen-protein adduct measurement.

Those who developed hepatotoxicity had a higher initial acetaminophen-protein adduct concentration compared to those who did not, 1.63 nmol/ml (IQR 0.76–2.02, n = 22) vs. 0.26 nmol/ml (IQR 0.15–0.41; n = 204; p <0.0001), respectively.

The AUROC for hepatotoxicity was 0.98 (95% CI 0.96–1.00; n = 226; p <0.0001) with acetaminophen-protein adduct concentration and 0.89 (95% CI 0.82–0.96; n = 219; p <0.0001) with ALT.

An acetaminophen-protein adduct concentration of 0.58 nmol/ml was 100% sensitive and 91% specific for identifying patients with an initial ALT ≤1,000 U/L who would develop hepatotoxicity.

Adding acetaminophen-protein adduct concentrations to risk prediction models improved prediction of hepatotoxicity to a level similar to that obtained by more complex models.

PARAGRAPH

Acetaminophen-protein adduct concentration on presentation predicted which patients with acetaminophen overdose subsequently developed hepatotoxicity, regardless of time of ingestion.

An adduct threshold of 0.58 nmol/L was required for optimal prediction.
