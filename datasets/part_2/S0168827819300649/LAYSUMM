TITLE

The non-transcriptional activity of IRF3 modulates hepatic immune cell populations in acute-on-chronic ethanol administration in mice

PARAGRAPH

Activation of the innate immune system contributes to inflammation in the progression of alcohol-related liver disease, as well as to the resolution of injury.

Here we show that the protein IRF3 modulates the innate immune environment of the liver in a mouse model of alcoholic hepatitis.

It does this by increasing the apoptotic cell death of immune cells that promote the resolution of injury.
