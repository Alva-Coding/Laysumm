TITLE

Ursodeoxycholic acid therapy and liver transplant-free survival in patients with primary biliary cholangitis

PARAGRAPH

In this international multicenter study of 3,902 patients with primary biliary cholangitis, we found that treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid is associated with prolonged liver transplant-free survival.

This association was significant, irrespective of sex, age, or disease stage.

The survival benefit remained statistically significant in patients with an incomplete biochemical response to ursodeoxycholic acid therapy.
