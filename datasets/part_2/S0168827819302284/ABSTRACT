ABSTRACT

TITLE

Ursodeoxycholic acid therapy and liver transplant-free survival in patients with primary biliary cholangitis

PARAGRAPH

The clinical efficacy of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) remains subject to debate as definitive randomized controlled trials are lacking.

We aimed to determine whether UDCA prolongs liver transplant (LT)-free survival in patients with PBC.

PARAGRAPH

This international cohort study included patients from the Global PBC Study Group database, originating from 8 countries in Europe and North America.

Both UDCA-treated and untreated patients were included.

LT and death were assessed as a combined endpoint through Cox regression analyses, with inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW).

PARAGRAPH

In the 3,902 patients included, the mean (SD) age was 54.3 (11.9) years, 3,552 patients (94.0%) were female, 3,529 patients (90.4%) were treated with UDCA and 373 patients (9.6%) were not treated.

The median (interquartile range) follow-up was 7.8 (4.1–12.1) years.

In total, 721 UDCA-treated patients and 145 untreated patients died or underwent LT. After IPTW, the 10-year cumulative LT-free survival was 79.7% (95% CI 78.1–81.2) among UDCA-treated patients and 60.7% (95% CI 58.2–63.4) among untreated patients (p <0.001).

UDCA was associated with a statistically significant reduced risk of LT or death (hazard ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.40–0.52; p <0.001).

The hazard ratio remained statistically significant in all stages of disease.

Patients classified as inadequate biochemical responders after 1 year of UDCA had a lower risk of LT or death than patients who were not treated (adjusted hazard ratio 0.56; 95% CI 0.45–0.69; p <0.001).

PARAGRAPH

The use of UDCA improves LT-free survival among patients with PBC, regardless of the disease stage and the observed biochemical response.

These findings support UDCA as the current universal standard of care in PBC.
