TITLE

TLR9 signalling in HCV-associated atypical memory B cells triggers Th1 and rheumatoid factor autoantibody responses

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Chronic HCV infection is associated with extrahepatic complications that are largely immunologically driven.

Among those, cryoglobulinaemia and its clinical sequelae hold the strongest association.

Cryoglobulins are readily detectable in 40–60% of HCV-infected patients,1–3 whereas cryoglobulinaemia vasculitis (CV) develops in only 5–10% of the cases.4,5

The presence of autoantibodies and T cells in vascular infiltrates as well as the observation that specific HLA alleles confer susceptibility to CV in HCV-infected patients support the autoimmune nature of this virus-associated pathology.6,7

CV pathophysiology depends on the interaction between HCV and lymphocytes that directly modulate B- and T cell function, which ultimately leads to the polyclonal activation and expansion of B cells producing rheumatoid factors (RFs).1,8

We previously reported abnormal immune responses mediated by T cells in patients with HCV-associated cryoglobulinaemia vasculitis (HCV-CV), with a quantitative defect in regulatory T cells (Tregs),6 and a Th1 polarization.9,10

HCV infection has been associated with lymphoproliferations, which likely result from an indirect process following the chronic antigenic stimulation of a limited pool of pre-existing autoreactive B cells.

It has been proposed that persistently high levels of HCV-containing immune complexes stimulate the proliferation of RF-bearing B cells, but the precise antigen(s) and stimulatory mechanisms have remained elusive.

Our group and others previously identified a clonal expansion of CD27+IgM+CD21low/− memory B cells, referred to as activated or atypical memory B cells (AtMs), in HCV-CV.11,12

AtMs are clonal or clonally related, and mainly express the VH1-69 IgH gene, which is also highly prevalent in HCV-associated lymphoproliferations.11–13

These clonal cells express reduced levels of the complement receptor 2, CD21, which mirrors an anergic state.14,15

AtMs are prone to undergoing apoptosis.11,13

They do not proliferate upon BCR stimulation but respond to the TLR9 agonist CpG by expressing activator and proliferative markers.11,13

Anergy is a well-known regulatory mechanism for maintaining immune tolerance of autoreactive cells.14,15

Indeed, AtMs in HCV-CV produced somatically mutated RF autoantibodies,16 and are not removed from the B cell repertoire.

However, it remains unclear why only some HCV-infected individuals develop CV, and why anergic mechanisms fail to prevent the development of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in some patients with HCV-CV.

PARAGRAPH

In this work, we characterized the mechanisms by which AtMs participate in HCV-associated autoimmunity.

We show that TLR9-stimulated AtMs secrete TNFα and IgMs with RF activity in patients with HCV-CV.

Stimulated AtMs have a specific transcriptional signature centred on TNFα overexpression, which promotes the activation of Th1 cells and conversely reduce Treg proliferation.

We found that AtM antibodies did not cross-react against HCV antigens but possessed RF activity.

Taken together, our data suggest a central role for TLR9 signalling in AtMs, in driving the breakdown in tolerance that underlies HCV-CV development.

Tbet+CD11c+CD27+CD21− atypical memory B cell expansions in HCV-CV

PARAGRAPH

Expansions of AtMs were previously identified in HCV-CV.11,12

The patients with HCV-CV examined here (Table 1), also displayed an increased frequency of AtMs (CD27+CD21− B cells) compared to patients with HCV without CV (28% [±4.9] vs. 8.3% [±1.9], p = 0.008), and healthy donors (HDs) (2.8% [±0.2], p = 0.001) (Fig. 1A, p = 0.0005).

A significant decrease in AtM frequency was also observed (47 [±5] vs. 21 [±5], p = 0.015) after CV remission following 12 weeks of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy (Fig. 1B).

Although the frequency of AtMs decreased, no significant change in AtM surface marker expression was observed following DAA therapy (Fig. S1).

AtMs were the main subpopulation among Tbet positive CD19+ B cells in patients with HCV-CV, but not in HCV controls and HDs (Fig. 1C, p = 0.0003) (49% [±5.8] vs. 21% [±1.15] and 16% [±5.8]).

Tbet positive CD19+ B cells exhibited a differential expression of surface molecules involved in T cell-B cell interactions compared to “classical” CD27+CD21+ resting memory B cells (RMs) (Fig. 1D-E).

HCV-CV AtMs showed significantly higher expression of CD11c (1.6 [±0.2] vs. 0.91 [±0.07], p = 0.01), CD95 (2.8 [±0.2] vs. 2 [±0.2], p = 0.04) and FCRL5 (1.17 [±0.2] vs. 0.55 [±0.18], p = 0.01) and decreased expression of CD73 (0.28 [±0.05] vs. 0.59 [±0.08], p = 0.003) and CXCR5 (18 [±1] vs. 29 [±2], p = 0.003) compared to RMs.

CD80 and FCRL3 expression tended to be higher in AtMs than RMs, while CD38 expression was decreased in AtMs compared to RMs (Fig. 1D-E).

Thus, AtMs in HCV-CV share common phenotypic features with AtM subsets described in other chronic infections, autoimmune diseases and healthy individuals.27–29

We further compared the expression of these surface molecules on AtM and RM subpopulations between HCV-CV, HCV controls and HD.

We found higher CD95, CD11c and CXCR5 expression in AtMs and RMs in patients with HCV-CV compared to HCV controls and HDs (AtMs: 2.8 [±0.2] vs. 1.2 [±0.5], p = 0.03 vs. 1.4 [0.1], p = 0.007; 1.6 [±0.2] vs. 0.7 [±0.05], p = 0.004 vs. 0.9 [±0.2]; 18 [±2] vs. 6 [±0.7], p = 0.009 vs. 5 [±0.8], p = 0.02) (RMs: 2 [±0.2] vs. 0.8 [±0.3], p = 0.02 vs. 0.6 [±0.08], p = 0.005; 0.9 [±0.07] vs. 0.4 [±0.02], p = 0.004 vs. 0.5 [±0.09], p = 0.03; 29 [±1.3] vs. 11 [±2], p = 0.005 vs. 12 [±1.8], p = 0.005).

CD80 expression was significantly lower in AtMs and RMs of patients with HCV-CV compared to HCV controls and HDs (AtM 0.9 [±0.09] vs. 1.4 [±0.007], p = 0.03 vs. 1.9 [±0.2], p = 0.007; RM 0.7 [±0.05] vs. 1.2 [±0.2], p = 0.02 vs. 1.1 [±0.03], p = 0.002).

We found no difference in the expression of CD73 and CD38 between AtM and RM subpopulations in HCV-CV, HCV controls and HDs (Fig. S2).

SECTION

TLR9 signalling in HCV-CV AtMs promote pro-inflammatory Th1 response

PARAGRAPH

TLR9 stimulation can lead to B cell dysfunction in autoimmune diseases.30,31

Stimulation with TLR9 ligand (i.e., CpG) of sorted AtMs from patients with active HCV-CV enhanced their secretion of TNFα (0.4% vs. 8.8%, p = 0.0003), but not of IL2, IL6 and IL10 (Fig. 2A, p = 0.75).

Enhanced secretion of TNFα upon CpG stimulation was significantly higher in AtMs of patients with HCV-CV compared to HCV controls and HDs (8.8 [±1] vs. 3.5 [±1], p = 0.01 vs. 3.5 [±0.5], p = 0.02) (Fig. 2A).

Stimulation by CpG also increased the proliferation of AtMs (2.5% vs. 39.5%, p = 0.001) (Fig. 2B, p = 0.027), and the production of IgM with reactivity to human IgG1 Fc (Fig. 2C).

We next analysed the function of AtMs by studying the expression of CD69, CD25, CD95 and CD44.

CD69, CD25 and CD95 expression on AtMs were significantly increased after stimulation by CpG in patients with HCV-CV and HCV controls (5.6 [±0.7] vs. 55 [±3.6], p = 0.0006, 14 [±2] vs. 58 [±2] p = 0.02; 9 [±2] vs. 44 [±10] p = 0.002, 4 [±1] vs. 42 [±5] p = 0.02; 19.5 [±0.2] vs. 61 [±9], p = 0.04, 6.9 [±1.3] vs. 23 [±0.6], p = 0.02) (Fig. 2D, respective p values for the expression of CD69, CD25, CD95 and CD44 were 0.43, 0.72, 0.86 and 0.95).

Stimulation of AtM cells with CpG has no significant impact on CD44 expression in patients with HCV-CV (Fig. 2D).

Th1 cells have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of HCV-CV.9,32

We therefore evaluated whether AtMs can control the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by CD4+CD25− effector T cells (Teffs) in patients with HCV-CV.

Sorted AtMs stimulated or not with CpG were cocultured with autologous CD4+CD25− T cells.

The presence of AtMs stimulated with CpG cocultured with autologous CD4+CD25− T cells tended to increase IFNγ (Fig. 3A, p = 0.028) and TNFα (Fig. 3B, p = 0.013) production by autologous CD4+CD25− T cells, but did not significantly affect IL17A expression (Fig. 3C, p = 0.73).

Functional defects of Tregs contribute to HCV-CV-associated autoimmune manifestations.6,33,34

However, it is still unclear whether clonally expanded AtMs contribute to the perturbations in T cell homeostasis in HCV-CV.

CpG-stimulated AtMs were cocultured with autologous Teffs or Tregs stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28.

CpG-stimulated AtMs reduced Treg proliferation (83% vs. 44%, p = 0.036), and increased Teff proliferation (81% vs. 89%, p = 0.01) (Fig. 3D,E).

Thus, TLR9 signalling in AtMs promotes the proliferation and secretion of IFNγ and TNFα but not IL17A by Teffs, and reduces the proliferation of Tregs in HCV-CV.

The addition of anti-TNFα in the co-culture significantly decreased IFNγ and TNFα secretion by Teffs but did not impact Treg proliferation (Fig. 3A,B).

No significant changes in the expression of functional markers of Tregs (CTLA4, ICOS and PD1) were observed when stimulated AtMs were cocultured with Tregs (data not shown).

SECTION

Stimulated HCV-CV AtMs harbour a specific TNFα-centred transcriptional profile

PARAGRAPH

Transcriptional profiling of HCV-CV AtMs previously revealed an association with molecular pathways involved in anergy, apoptosis, and dampened activation of B cells.11,13

To define gene signatures associated with the effect of TLR9 stimulation on AtMs, we compared gene expression profiles of CpG-stimulated and unstimulated AtMs (control) from patients with HCV-CV (Fig. 4).

We identified a gene signature of 229 genes in total (210 upregulated and 19 downregulated) in CpG-stimulated AtMs compared to controls (Fig. 4A).

Functional enrichment analysis in CpG-stimulated AtMs revealed many upregulated genes that are involved in B- and Th1-cell activation (Fig. 4B).

Among the top upregulated genes, we found high expression of MIR155HG which codes for miRNA-155.

miRNA-155 influences BCR signalling and is highly expressed on activated B cells,35 contributing to a breakage in tolerance when induced in B cells upon TLR9 signalling.30

Interestingly, the pro-inflammatory cytokine MIF, which drives the Th1 response,36 was also highly expressed in CpG-stimulated AtMs.

We then focused on the molecular networks showing the most induced genes as a group in CpG-stimulated AtMs (Fig. 4C).

The gene content of this transcriptional module was enriched in genes encoding proteins involved in B cell activation and differentiation, signal transduction and in T cell co-stimulation, such as TNFα, interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF4), BLIMP1 (PRDM1), and STAT3 genes (Fig. 4C).

Among the top genes downregulated, we identified FAIM3 that encodes an IgM Fc receptor, and which may serve as an uptake receptor for IgM-opsonized antigens by B cells.37

Hydrogen voltage-gated channel 1 (HVCN1) coding for a voltage-gated proton channel and C8orf13-BLK (src family tyrosine kinase) were also downregulated in CpG-stimulated AtMs.

Interestingly, HVCN1-deficient mice exhibit autoimmune phenotypes including splenomegaly, nephritis, and autoantibody production.38

Polymorphisms of C8orf13-BLK are associated with autoimmune diseases.39–41

Altogether, these data suggest that the activation of AtMs through TLR9 signalling could lead to a Th1 pro-inflammatory state, which could facilitate the breakdown in tolerance in HCV infection.

SECTION

AtMs display antigen-driven maturation features

PARAGRAPH

To characterize the antibody repertoire and reactivity of AtMs, we isolated single circulating blood AtMs from 3 donors (Fig. 5A), amplified and sequenced their heavy- and light-chain variable domain (IgH and IgL, respectively) genes.

We found that most if not all captured AtMs belong to unique clonal families (96 to 100%) (Fig. 5B), characterized by various degrees of clonal diversity depending on the donor (Fig. 5C).

Clonally expanded B cells in donor patient 1 expressed IgMs encoded by VH1-69/DH3-10/JH4 and Vκ3-20/Jκ2 rearrangements (Fig. 5D).

Interestingly, patient 2 and patient 3 donors showed clonal expansions of AtMs with very similar recombined IgH and IgL.

Both used VH3-7 and JH3 genes with a DH3-10 or DH3-22 segment, and Vκ3-15 and Jκ1 genes (Fig. 5D).

AtM antibodies displayed moderate to relatively high levels of somatic mutations in IgH and IgL variable genes (Fig. 5E).

Somatic mutations showed a strong selection of replacement mutations in complementarity-determining regions compared to framework regions (Fig. 5F), suggesting that anergic AtMs were shaped following an antigen-driven affinity maturation process.

SECTION

AtM antibodies are rheumatoid factors lacking HCV reactivity

PARAGRAPH

To identify the antigen specificities of HCV-CV AtM antibodies, we produced recombinant monoclonal antibodies that were representative of each clonal expansion (Fig. 5C).

IgM expressed by clonally expanded anergic AtMs has been shown to exert RF activity.16

All recombinant IgM antibodies recognized the human IgG1 Fc fragment (IgG1-Fc) (Fig. 6A), confirming their RF activity.

Fab fragments of parental IgM but not IgG counterparts bound to IgG1-Fc, which may be explained by self-competition for RF binding sites when the full IgG molecule is expressed in complex with its own Fc.

They also reacted against IgG1-Fc by immunoblotting (Fig. 6B) but not against any of the overlapping peptides covering the entire Fc region (Fig. 6C), suggesting that the epitopes recognized by AtM antibodies are conformational.

Moreover, we assessed whether unresponsive RF-expressing AtMs display auto- and polyreactive properties.

ELISA binding experiments showed that IgG and IgM RF antibodies exhibit neither polyreactivity nor self-reactivity against HEp-2 cell antigens (Fig. 6D).

Cross-reactivity of RF antibodies against HCV antigens has been suggested,42–44 but never formally demonstrated.

ELISA binding analysis showed that none of the recombinant antibodies recognized HCV NS3-5, Core, or E2 proteins (Fig. 6E).

SECTION

AtM antibodies recognize distinct IgG-Fc epitopes

PARAGRAPH

To define more precisely the epitopes targeted by AtM-derived RF, we first investigated the potential role of Fc-associated N-glycans.

Antibody binding analyses showed that IgM reactivity was not affected by the absence of N-glycans in position N297 (Fig. 7A).

Since the association of Staphylococcus aureus protein A with Fc protein was previously shown to interfere with HCV-associated RF reactivity,16 we next assayed the IgM binding to Fc in the presence of purified protein A. Competition ELISA analyses indicated that protein A could block or decrease the Fc-binding by representative IgMs from patient 1 and patient 2 but not from patient 3 (Fig. 7B).

Finally, we compared IgM binding to IgG1, IgG3 and hybrid Fc molecules made up of the H-CH2 of IgG1 followed by the CH3 of IgG3, and vice versa.

Our results showed that 1-04 bound preferentially to IgG1 and hybrid Fc proteins and to a lesser extent to IgG3 (Fig. 7C).

The lower affinity variant 1-10 as well as 2-23 and 3-70 only reacted against the entire IgG1 Fc and its CH3 domain on the corresponding hybrid molecule (Fig. 7C).

Together, these data suggest that the RF expressed by the expanded clonal AtMs target various epitopes on the human Fc (Fig. 7D).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Immune dysregulation in HCV-CV involves expansion of anergic AtMs believed to produce RF autoantibodies.1,8,16

HCV-CV AtMs have increased levels of molecules involved in T-B cell interactions including CD11c, CD80 and CD86/B7-2.11,13

AtMs with similar phenotypic features have also been identified in the context of chronic infections,45–47 in autoimmune diseases,15,48 and in healthy individuals.27

We found here that AtMs have higher expression of T-bet, CD11c, CD80, CD95, FCRL3, and FCRL5, and decreased CD73 and CXCR5 surface levels compared to RMs in HCV-CV.13,49,50

Moreover, T-bet expression in AtMs was enhanced in patients with HCV-CV compared to HCV controls without CV.

Interestingly, the expansion of AtMs in patients with HCV-CV decreased significantly after DAA therapy, whereas the expression of AtM surface markers remained unchanged.

This is likely a consequence of the antigens’ removal, and cessation of chronic viral stimulation of autoreactive AtMs following DAA therapy.

PARAGRAPH

Human AtMs may differ functionally depending on the context of chronic infection or autoimmunity.

HIV- and malaria-associated AtMs exhibit markedly reduced cytokine and antibody production capacity,45,51,52 whereas AtMs found in autoimmune diseases produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and autoantibodies.53–55

HCV-CV AtMs resemble exhausted cells found in chronic inflammation, which are anergic and lack the potential to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells.15

However, TLR9 signalling in AtMs could break this anergic state.56

While such signals would ordinarily trigger apoptosis, cognate T cell help and cytokines such as IFNγ and TNFα could promote autoantibody production.57

We showed here that stimulation of AtMs by TLR9 ligand CpG drives their differentiation into RF-producing cells.

We found that CpG-stimulated AtMs display enhanced TNFα secretion, which is likely responsible for the proliferation and secretion of IFNγ and TNFα by Teffs.

The interplay between BCR, TLR9, and cytokine signalling in the generation of T-bet+ CD11c+ B cells has recently been unveiled.58

In mice, Plasmodium DNA-sensing through TLR9 along with IFNγR have been shown to provide an essential synergizing signal for promoting AtM expansion and the subsequent development of autoimmune anaemia.59

Activation of murine autoreactive RF+ B cells by immune complexes requires the synergistic engagement of the BCR and MyD88-dependent TLR members (i.e., TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9).60

These data suggest a critical link between innate and adaptive immune responses in the development of systemic autoimmune diseases, particularly when associated with chronic infections.

Thus, consistent with our results, we hypothesize that TLR9 signalling could activate anergic RF-expressing AtMs, which in turn would create a pro-inflammatory environment by favouring a Th1 response.

Analyses of the transcriptional program of CpG-activated HCV-CV AtMs provided further evidence supporting this scenario.

HCV-CV AtMs were previously shown to be associated with molecular pathways involved in anergy, and dampened activation of B cells via their BCR.1,4

In contrast, CpG-stimulated AtMs upregulated many genes involved in B cell activation and T-B interactions, and centred on TNFα overexpression.

TNFα activates STAT3, a key regulator of B cell proliferation and survival.61

Higher transcript expression of miRNA-155 and the heat shock proteins (HSP90B1, HSPD1, HSPE1), which are known to induce B cell activation and to disrupt immune tolerance,8–10 as well as IRF4 and BLIMP1, which promote immunoglobulin production,62 was also demonstrated in activated AtMs.

Moreover, we identified a transcriptomic program in TLR-9-stimulated AtMs that drives T-B cell interactions (TNFα, IRF4, and STAT3) and Th1 pro-inflammatory immune responses (MIF).

Taken together, these data suggest that activation of AtMs through TLR9 signalling leads to RF production and a B cell-driven Th1 pro-inflammatory state.

AtMs captured from HCV-CV were part of large single clonal expansions and showed clear evidence of antigen-driven maturation.11,12,16

AtM-derived recombinant IgM antibodies displayed RF activity with increased binding to IgG-Fc by avidity effects, as shown elsewhere.16

Fc-binding was not due to polyreactivity and was not associated with additional autoreactivity features.

This contrasts with the frequent or predominant poly- and self-reactivity described for the AtM subsets expanded in other infectious and autoimmune diseases.15,47,63,64

Interestingly, mapping of AtM RFs revealed the diversity of targeted epitopes on the Fc region, with no immunodominance towards a common unique epitope.

This is reminiscent of the epitopic diversity characterizing RFs in rheumatoid arthritis,65 which probably use different types of interactions for Fc recognition.66,67

The E2 subunit of the HCV envelope spike contains a β-sandwich element sharing structural homology with immunoglobulin domains.68

A phenomenon of molecular mimicry between Ig folds of human IgGs and HCV envelope glycoproteins has been proposed to explain the development of RFs in HCV-CV.42

However, we found that AtM RF IgMs do not cross-react with HCV antigens including the E2 moiety.

In line with this, whether antibodies expressed by HCV-associated lymphoma cells, some of which exhibit RF activity, truly recognize the E2 protein remains equivocal.44,69,70

Thus, IgGs, possibly bound to viral antigens as immune complexes, are most likely the only culprits driving the emergence of clonally expanded B cells with RF activity in HCV-CV.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, our results suggest a central role for TLR9 activation of AtMs in breaking tolerance in patients with HCV-CV.

Importantly, we showed in HCV-CV that CpG-stimulated AtMs, through the secretion of TNFα, have deleterious effects, by stimulating proliferation and activation of effector Th1 cells, inhibiting Treg proliferation and promoting the production of IgM with RF activity.

RF molecules produced by AtMs recognized distinct IgG-Fc epitopes and did not cross-react against HCV proteins, confirming that molecular mimicry between HCV and human IgG proteins is not the trigger of HCV-associated autoimmunity.
