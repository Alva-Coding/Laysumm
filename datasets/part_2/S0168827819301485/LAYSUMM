TITLE

A comprehensive study of epigenetic alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma identifies potential therapeutic targets

PARAGRAPH

In this study, we found that mutations and changes in expression of epigenetic modifiers are common events in human hepatocellular carcinoma, leading to an aggressive gene expression program and poor clinical prognosis.

The transcriptional program can be reversed by pharmacological inhibition of Jumonji enzymes.

This inhibition blocks hepatocellular carcinoma progression, providing a novel potential therapeutic strategy.
