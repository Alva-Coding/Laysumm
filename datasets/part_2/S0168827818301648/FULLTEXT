TITLE

Magnetic resonance cholangiogram patterns and clinical profiles of ketamine-related cholangiopathy in drug users

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Recreational inhalation of ketamine is emerging as a major global social and health issue.1,2

Although ketamine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, has medical uses in anaesthesia and chronic pain control, its highly addictive nature has led to a massive increase in recreational consumption worldwide.

Because of the ease of production and low cost, the non-medical use of ketamine is increasing especially in East and South-East Asia, with its lifetime prevalence in the general population ranging from 0.3% to 2.0%,3 comprising up to 39.7% of total recreational drugs users in these regions.4

The self-reported recreational use of ketamine in Western countries, including the UK, Australia, and Canada, is also increasing.5,6

From 2008 to 2014, law enforcement seizures of ketamine worldwide increased by more than threefold.3

PARAGRAPH

Long-term heavy use of ketamine is associated with different medical problems, including cognitive impairment and psychological issues.7

Damage to the urological system is also well documented, with many ketamine users developing a large variety of urinary problems, ranging from lower urinary tract symptoms and bladder incontinence to hydronephrosis, renal impairment, and papillary necrosis.8,9

Urinary tract damage seemed reversible in a proportion of patients who ceased ketamine use.10

Long-term ketamine use is also associated with deranged liver biochemistry11,12 and biliary tract anomalies, ranging from common bile duct dilatation13 to intrahepatic beading and strictures.14

The anatomical description of biliary anomalies had been limited to small case series;12,13,15,16 a detailed depiction of different cholangiopathic patterns and their correlation with clinical characteristics, as well as any potential reversibility of biliary anomalies after ketamine cessation, remains lacking.

In addition, studies aimed at recruiting recreational drug users are hampered by high default rates,17 rendering the organisation of investigations and longitudinal follow-up difficult.

PARAGRAPH

As ketamine continues to be a drug of widespread recreational use, it is imperative to further understand its effects on the biliary system, the patterns of clinical and radiological presentation, and possible clinical sequelae.

To address this important issue, we have established a territory-wide community network of non-government charitable service organizations actively tackling substance abuse in Hong Kong to enrol recreational ketamine users for delineation of biliary anatomy via magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiography as well as to determine the natural course of their biliary disease.

SECTION

Methods

SECTION

Study participants

PARAGRAPH

Our recruiting population consisted of recreational users of ketamine who were referred from different substance abuse clinics and non-profit charitable service organizations that were providing medical and social support to recreational drug users in Hong Kong (Fig. S1).

Ketamine for inhalational delivery was the most common drug abused in newly reported recreational drug users in Hong Kong from 2006 to 2014.18

The seven charitable service organizations that participated in our current study had established a community network in different townships, with coverage extending to all 18 geographical districts of Hong Kong.

Potential participants were referred to North District Hospital and Queen Mary Hospital, which are located in the northern and southern regions of Hong Kong respectively.

PARAGRAPH

From December 2012 to April 2017, consecutive Chinese individuals aged 18 years or older who had used ketamine recreationally at least twice per month for six months in the previous two years were recruited.

Both individuals who used ketamine only and concomitantly with other recreational psychotropic drugs were recruited.

Additional inclusion criteria included either the presence of an elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level (upper limit of normal 110 U/L for men and 93 U/L for women) or the presence of new-onset lower urinary tract symptoms, including dysuria, urine incontinence, haematuria, increased urinary frequency, or suprapubic discomfort, for ≥6 months requiring specialist urology assessment.8,9

Individuals without an elevated ALP level or urinary symptoms were offered abdominal ultrasonography, and were included if ultrasonography showed any biliary abnormalities.

Patients with known coexisting biliary disorders, including recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and immunoglobulin G4 sclerosing cholangitis, previous biliary surgery, suspected inflammatory bowel disease, or contraindications to MR imaging (including pacemakers and metal implants) were excluded.

Informed consent was obtained from all participants.

PARAGRAPH

This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier NCT02165488).

Ethical approval was obtained from the respective institutional review boards (University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster, and Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong-New Territories East Cluster) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

SECTION

Imaging

PARAGRAPH

MR cholangiography was performed for all study participants with either a 1.5 T Achieva MR imaging scanner (Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) or a 1.5 T Signa HD MR imaging scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA).

The MR imaging protocol consisted of coronal and axial T2-weighted sequences, T1-weighted in-phase and opposed-phase two-dimensional MR cholangiography sequences, and three-dimensional MR cholangiography sequences with maximum intensity projection reconstruction.

Further technical description can be found (Table S1).

PARAGRAPH

The MR cholangiography images were then analysed independently by two gastrointestinal radiologists with at least eight years of experience in abdominal MR imaging.

Both radiologists were blinded to the clinical and biochemical data of all study participants.

MR cholangiographic findings were categorized anatomically, as the extrahepatic ductal system (common and hepatic bile ducts), the biliary confluence, the left and right intrahepatic ducts, the pancreatic duct, and the gallbladder.

The presence of dilatation, strictures, beading, and other cholangiographic abnormalities were reported.

Extrahepatic ductal diameter was measured at the midpoint, with dilatation defined as >7 mm in diameter.19

Intrahepatic ductal dilatation was gauged with use of the corresponding extrahepatic ducts as a reference.

Any discordance in reporting was resolved by consensus reading before a final decision was reached.

SECTION

Clinical assessment

PARAGRAPH

All study participants underwent a questionnaire-based assessment detailing their history of the use of ketamine and other recreational drugs, as well as smoking and alcohol history.

The concomitant recreational drugs included were based on local epidemiological data,18 and included methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; commonly known as ecstasy), methamphetamine (commonly known as ice), heroin and other narcotic analgesics, cocaine, cannabis, sedatives (including midazolam, triazolam, and zopiclone), nimetazepam, and cough mixtures, with a positive exposure defined similarly at a frequency of at least twice per month for six months in the previous two years.

Recreational drug use was further supplemented by urine toxicology testing (Multidrug One Step Screen Test Panel; Abon Pharma, Hangzhou, China).

Any subsequent abstinence from ketamine and other recreational drugs was recorded, with abstinence verified by the participant’s respective charitable service organisation or substance abuse clinic.

Gastrointestinal and urinary symptoms were documented, as were prior hospital admissions and visits to the emergency department.

Liver and renal biochemistry were regularly monitored at intervals of 3–6 months.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Continuous variables were expressed as the mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range [IQR]) as appropriate.

The weighted kappa statistic was used to calculate interobserver agreement.20

Statistical comparisons were performed with Student’s t test or the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and the Chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables.

Variables with p <0.10 in univariate analysis were entered into a multivariate model which was performed with binary logistic regression.

The predictions of biliary tract anomalies on MR cholangiography were examined by the construction of corresponding receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, followed by assessment of accuracy via AUC.

The Youden index, defined as sensitivity plus specificity minus 1, was used to define the optimal cut-off level for prediction.

All data were analysed with IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).

A two-tailed p value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

Results

SECTION

Study participants

PARAGRAPH

As depicted in Fig. 1, among 343 consecutive recreational users of ketamine referred for study screening, 257 individuals (74.9%) were eventually recruited, of which 155 (60.3%) had an elevated serum ALP level.

The clinical characteristics of all 257 participants are depicted in Table 1.

The mean age was 28.7 (±5.8) years; 249 (96.9%) were younger than 40 years.

Overall, 151 participants (58.7%) had at least 10 years of ketamine exposure, and 33 participants (12.8%) had at least 15 years of ketamine exposure.

A total of 81 individuals (31.2%) were concomitantly using recreational drugs (details in Fig. S2).

PARAGRAPH

Patients with elevated ALP level when compared with patients with normal ALP level had a significantly higher proportion of urological problems, including previous emergency attendances for urinary symptoms (54.8% vs. 32.4%, p <0.001), inpatient urology admissions (23.2% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.001), and hydronephrosis on imaging (24.5% vs. 13.7%, p = 0.035).

The proportions of patients with abdominal discomfort requiring prior inpatient care (29.0% vs. 38.2%, p = 0.138) and upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy (27.7% vs. 30.4%, p = 0.646) were similar.

Only five patients (1.9%) had prior hospitalization for biliary sepsis, and all five patients had elevated serum ALP level (median 518 U/L, IQR 172–1,257 U/L).

SECTION

Biliary tract anomalies on MR cholangiography

PARAGRAPH

MR cholangiography showed biliary tract anomalies in 159 participants (61.9%), and these were significantly more common in participants with elevated ALP level (123/155) when compared with participants with normal ALP level (36/102) (p <0.001).

We observed three distinct radiological patterns.

Diffuse dilatation of extrahepatic ducts (Fig. 2A) was noted in 73 participants (45.9%), whereas fusiform dilatation of extrahepatic ducts with distal tapering (Fig. 2B) was noted in 64 participants (40.3%).

The mean extrahepatic ductal diameters of the two groups were 10.4 (±2.5) and 11.8 (±2.9) mm, respectively, with a significantly greater ductal diameter noted in participants with fusiform dilatation (p = 0.003).

Median serum ALP levels were similar among these two groups (140 U/L vs. 135 U/L, p = 0.754).

PARAGRAPH

A total of 91 participants (57.2%) had intrahepatic duct changes, of which 55 (60.4%) had ductal dilatation, and 36 (39.6%) additionally displayed ductal beading and strictures.

Only 22 participants (24.2%) had no concomitant extrahepatic duct changes (Fig. 2C), with a mean extrahepatic ductal diameter of 5.7 (±1.1) mm.

PARAGRAPH

Participants with fusiform extrahepatic ductal dilatation, when compared with those with diffuse ductal dilatation, had a greater mean extrahepatic ductal diameter (11.8 mm vs. 10.4 mm, p = 0.003).

PARAGRAPH

Univariate and multivariate analysis of factors associated with biliary tract anomalies on MR cholangiography are depicted in Table 2.

The lack of concomitant recreational drug use (odds ratio [OR] 1.99; 95% CI 1.11–3.58; p = 0.021), an increased ALP level (OR 1.007; 95% CI 1.002–1.012; p = 0.003), and a history of emergency attendance for urinary symptoms (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.03–3.70) were independently associated with biliary tract anomalies.

The duration of ketamine exposure had no association with biliary diseases (p >0.05).

PARAGRAPH

The interobserver agreement of MR interpretation was satisfactory, with a weighted kappa value of 0.89 (95% CI 0.85–0.94) for the presence of biliary anomalies.

The positive and negative agreements were 0.71 (95% CI 0.58–0.81) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.91–0.98), respectively.

There were 27 cases (10.5%) of discrepancies that required consensus reading.

SECTION

Predictive value of serum ALP level for biliary tract anomalies

PARAGRAPH

The ROC curves and AUC values of serum ALP level in predicting biliary tract anomalies on MR cholangiography are illustrated in Fig. 3.

Serum ALP level produced a greater AUC for biliary tract anomalies in participants using solely ketamine (AUC 0.800) when compared with the overall study cohort and participants with concomitant recreational drug use (AUC 0.745 and 0.642, respectively).

In both the overall study cohort and participants using solely ketamine, on the basis of the Youden index, the optimal cut-off serum ALP level to predict biliary tract anomalies was ≥113 U/L.

PARAGRAPH

The sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios of serum ALP level in predicting biliary tract anomalies are shown in Table 3.

A serum ALP level of ≥113 U/L had a positive predictive value of 79.3% for biliary tract anomalies among the overall study cohort, increasing to 85.4% among participants using solely ketamine.

The negative predictive value was low, at 58.9–59.3%.

Use of a higher cut-off value (e.g. 200 U/L) resulted in a positive predictive value of 91.3% for all participants and 100% for participants using solely ketamine.

Lowering the cut-off value to, for example, 90 U/L (the upper limit of normal for female patients) only modestly increased the negative predictive value to 66.7% for both cohorts.

SECTION

Outcomes and reversibility after abstinence

PARAGRAPH

A total of 21 participants agreed to reassessment MR cholangiography after a median duration of 12.1 (IQR 6.1–15.8) months.

The changes in extrahepatic ductal diameter are depicted in Fig. 4A.

The six participants (28.6%) with confirmed ketamine abstinence had a mean decrease in extrahepatic ductal diameter of 5.7 (±3.7) mm (example shown in Fig. 4B), whereas the 15 participants with continued ketamine use experienced a mean increase of 0.7 (±2.7) mm (p <0.001).

The differences in changes in median serum ALP levels were also significant (reduction of 41 U/L vs. increase of 17 U/L, p = 0.016).

PARAGRAPH

A 56-year-old male patient was noted to be have decompensated cirrhosis with a bilirubin level of 114 µmol/L and a model for end-stage liver disease score of 17 on presentation.

He had no other concomitant chronic liver disease, but had been recreationally using ketamine solely for 21 years.

MR cholangiography showed diffuse intrahepatic ductal strictures and a diffusely dilated extrahepatic duct of 8 mm (Fig. S3).

He had no history of inflammatory bowel disease, his serum immunoglobulin G4 level was normal, and he was negative for serum antimitochondrial antibody.

Secondary biliary cirrhosis was diagnosed, and he was referred for liver transplantation, but developed sudden cardiac arrest due to pneumonia before completion of transplant workup.

PARAGRAPH

Concerning urological complications, eight patients required subsequent nephrostomy insertion for upper ureteric obstruction, of which seven (87.5%) had coexisting biliary tract anomalies.

Only one patient eventually required bilateral nephrectomy for non-functioning kidneys and long-term renal replacement therapy.

Also, two patients required augmentation cystoplasty for contracted bladder, one of whom had coexisting biliary tract anomalies.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Our study characterized the MR imaging patterns among a large population of recreational ketamine users and their association with different clinical profiles.

To our knowledge, this is the largest prospective study on ketamine-related cholangiopathy with MR cholangiography performed in all participants.

PARAGRAPH

With a mean age of 28.7 years and a mean ketamine exposure duration of 10.5 years, our study cohort was representative of the real-world recreational drug user situation in Hong Kong.18

More than 60% of ketamine drug users had biliary tract anomalies, which can be further categorized distinctively as extrahepatic and intrahepatic involvement.

Extrahepatic changes were common, seen in 86.2% of affected individuals, and were in the form of diffuse or fusiform dilatation, consistent with findings from published case series.12,13,15,16

No extrahepatic strictures were noted, which is a marked difference from the radiological presentation of primary sclerosing cholangitis.21

Intrahepatic ductal changes, previously described only in a case report,14 were present in >50% of affected participants.

Although the exact mechanism of ketamine-related biliary damage is unknown, it might be related to smooth muscle N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor blockade,22 or may be associated with the increase in flow resistance across the sphincter of Oddi.23

PARAGRAPH

Our study also demonstrated the predictive value of serum ALP level for biliary tract anomalies in ketamine users.

An increase in ALP level was independently associated with biliary tract changes (Table 2), and among participants using solely ketamine, resulted in an AUC of 0.800 with a positive predictive value of 85.4% for a cut-off level of 113 U/L (Fig. 3 and Table 3).

Serum ALP level can therefore be used as an easily available screening test for underlying ketamine-related cholangiopathy.

Sole ketamine use without other concomitant recreational drugs besides improving the accuracy of ALP, was an important risk factor for biliary tract anomalies (Table 2).

Recreational polydrug users are usually less dependent on ketamine than on other recreational drugs.24

Thus, the lack of concomitant drug use might be a surrogate indicator for increased ketamine intake and exposure, leading to an increased risk of biliary complications.

The duration of ketamine exposure in our present study showed no relationship to biliary tract anomalies.

This might be related to the unreliability of self-reporting by recreational drug users.25

PARAGRAPH

Despite a high positive predictive value, serum ALP level had low negative predictive values regardless of different cut-off thresholds, implying a substantial cohort of ketamine users with low or normal ALP levels had already developed biliary tract anomalies.

The presence of concomitant ketamine-related uropathy, as illustrated by emergency attendances for urinary symptoms being a risk factor (Table 2), might be an important clinical indicator for biliary tract screening.

Abdominal symptoms, in contrast, had no relationship with biliary tract anomalies, which can be explained by other upper gastrointestinal tract problems being common among ketamine users.26

Similarly to other forms of sclerosing cholangiopathies,21,27 biliary sepsis was not a common clinical manifestation, and was seen in only 3.1% of affected individuals.

PARAGRAPH

The long-term clinical outcome of different ketamine-related cholangiopathic patterns is still unknown.

With reference to primary sclerosing cholangitis, distinct cholangiographic patterns might have a prognostic value,28 and longitudinal studies on this aspect will be required.

It is important to note our study cohort comprised a patient who developed decompensated cirrhosis.

This patient not only had long-standing exposure to ketamine but was also much older (56 years) than the other patients.

Secondary biliary cirrhosis in ketamine users has been reported previously,29 and is an additional ominous complication of continued ketamine use.

At the same time, biliary tract damage was reversible after ketamine abstinence, with biochemical and radiological improvement (Fig. 4).

The potential reversibility of ketamine-related biliary damage after abstinence is an important public health message in the combat against substance abuse, especially when withdrawal symptoms associated with ketamine use cessation are milder than those associated with cessation of use of other recreational drugs.1,30

PARAGRAPH

In terms of study limitations, our two study centres used different MR scanners, and hence the imaging protocols were not completely standardized.

Nonetheless, we ensured reporting quality by the involvement of two experienced and independent radiologists who were blinded to the participants’ clinical data.

Our MR study cohort did not include individuals with normal serum ALP level, no urinary symptoms, and normal abdominal ultrasonography findings (n = 28) (Fig. 1).

Although any potential selection bias can affect the predictive value of ALP level, the excluded subgroup accounted for only 8.1% of the total screened population, and on the basis of the similarities of our baseline profiles (Table 1) with those of the general ketamine use cohort in our locality,18 our present study is representative of the real-world recreational drug use situation.

At the same time, our study has important strengths.

Through collaboration with different charitable service organizations, we overcame the high default rates seen in studies involving drug users,17 and successfully recruited consecutive participants directly from the community, ensuring our study results would reflect the real-world scenario of substance abuse in Asia.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, distinctive MR cholangiographic patterns were noted in a large population of recreational ketamine users.

Serum ALP, sole use of ketamine, and concomitant urinary symptoms had a predictive value for biliary tract anomalies.

Although ketamine-related cholangiopathy is potentially reversible after abstinence, secondary biliary cirrhosis might develop after prolonged exposure.

The present study findings enhance our understanding of ketamine’s toxic effects on the biliary tract, and may aid public health efforts against the growing epidemic of recreational ketamine use.
