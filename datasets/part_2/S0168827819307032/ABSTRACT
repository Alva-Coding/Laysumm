ABSTRACT

TITLE

The chances of hepatic resection curing hepatocellular carcinoma

PARAGRAPH

The popular sense of the word “cure” implies that a patient treated for a specific disease will return to have the same life-expectancy as if he/she had never had the disease.

In analytic terms, it translates into the concept of statistical cure which occurs when a group of patients returns to having similar mortality to a reference population.

Aim of the study was to assess the probability of being cured from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by hepatic resection.

PARAGRAPH

Data from 2523 patients undergoing resection for HCC were used to fit statistical cure models to compare disease-free survival (DFS) after surgery to survival expected for chronic hepatitis – cirrhotic patients and the general population, matched by sex, age, race/ethnicity and year of diagnosis.

PARAGRAPH

The probability of resection to provide the same life-expectancy of patients with chronic hepatitis – cirrhosis, was 26.3%.

The conditional probability to achieve this result was time-dependent, requiring about 8.9 year for being accomplished with 95% certainty.

Considering the general population as reference, the cure fraction decreased to 17.1%.

Uncured patients had a median DFS of 1.5 years.

In multi-variable analysis, patient’s age and the risk for early HCC recurrence (within 2 years) were independent determinants of the chance of cure (p<0.001).

The chances of being cured ranged between 36.0% for subjects at low risk for early recurrence and only about 3.6% for those at high risk.

PARAGRAPH

Estimates of the chance of being cured of HCC by resection showed that this goal is achievable and its likelihood increases with the passing of recurrence-free time.

Present information can be used to accurately inform patients and make informed clinical decisions.
