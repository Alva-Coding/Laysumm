TITLE

Toll-like receptor 3 downregulation is an escape mechanism from apoptosis during hepatocarcinogenesis

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a heterogeneous disease associated with a poor prognosis.

In patients with HCC, TLR3 downregulation is associated with reduced survival.

Herein, we show that the absence of TLR3 is associated with a lower rate of apoptosis, and subsequently more rapid hepatocarcinogenesis, without any change to the immune infiltrate in the liver.

Therefore, the poor prognosis associated with low TLR3 expression in HCC is likely linked to tumors ability to escape apoptosis.

TLR3 may become a promising therapeutic target in TLR3-positive HCC.
