TITLE

Planning and prioritizing direct-acting antivirals treatment for HCV patients in countries with limited resources: Lessons from the Egyptian experience

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Egypt has the highest prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection,1 having an antibody prevalence in the population aged 15–59 years of about 10% and viremic prevalence of 7%,2 with almost all infections due to genotype 4 (GT4).3

This burden necessitated strong commitment on the part of policy-makers to adopt efficient curative interventions.

This has translated into the largest national treatment program for HCV in the world.4

Lessons from the successes and difficulties of the program can benefit all resource-limited countries with similar problems caused by hepatitis C.

PARAGRAPH

With the approval of sofosbuvir (SOF), SOF based therapies became standard of care,5,6 and the Egyptian National Committee for the Control of Viral Hepatitis (NCCVH) endeavored to make oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) available for the national treatment program at affordable prices.7–9

A web-based registry was set up to arrange patient appointments and visits and to record patient data, through a central database.9

PARAGRAPH

With limited financial resources, limited initial supply of medication, and the limited capacities of treatment centers to handle the huge number of patients living with the diagnosis, initially there was a need to prioritize treatment for patients with advanced fibrosis and to postpone treatment for patients with less advanced disease.

This was implemented through sequential modification of treatment protocols to accommodate availability of more medications, and to adapt to administrative difficulties as they appeared.

Several changes were made during the first 18 months of the program, to include more patients, to change treatment regimens according to results, and to include newer drugs as they became available.

Cost was always a factor in the decision making process, while selecting regimens suitable to the unique situation of HCV-GT4 in the Egyptian population was crucial.10–12

PARAGRAPH

Herein, we present the Egyptian experience in planning and prioritizing treatment for the largest number of patients with HCV in a national program.

We present patient characteristics, problems and improvements in patient follow-up, as well as available sustained virological response (SVR) rates of different drug combinations used in these cohorts, which were based on drug availability and the limited resources of the country.

Difficulties and limitations are also discussed.

SECTION

Patients and methods

PARAGRAPH

The national hepatitis treatment program included patients with chronic HCV who received therapy in the viral hepatitis specialized treatment centers.

A total of 337,042 patients started treatment from October 2014 (first inclusion of DAAs in the national treatment program) until the end of March 2016.

All those who commenced treatment during this time have known baseline data and had completed 12 or 24 weeks of treatment and passed the 12-week follow-up by the time this report was written.

We report baseline characteristics for all patients.

The proportion of patients with known SVR at 12 weeks (SVR12) was recorded, and their results are presented.

PARAGRAPH

Patients signed an informed consent that clearly stated possible outcomes and adverse events, and included approval to use their anonymous data in research publications.

This report complies with the Declaration of Helsinki.

PARAGRAPH

For this analysis, patients were categorized into three equal time-periods of six months each according to time of initiating treatment:

Cohort-1: October 2014 to end of March 2015,

Cohort-2: April 2015 to September 2015,

Cohort-3: October 2015 to end of March 2016.

PARAGRAPH

In addition, we include follow-up data of 94,258 patients who started treatment in April–May 2016, to assess change in efficacy of follow-up after the end of these three cohorts.

Their baseline data are not included in the analysis, but the proportion of patients with known outcome and their SVR12 results are included for comparison.

PARAGRAPH

In October 2014, two DAAs containing regimens were available in Egypt: the combination of SOF, pegylated-interferon and RBV (SOF-PEG-RBV) for 12 weeks and the combination of SOF-RBV for 24 weeks for those who were interferon ineligible.7

The NCCVH set the first treatment guideline and prioritized treatment for patients with advanced fibrosis.

Patients were included if they had either liver biopsy result showing fibrosis stage F3 or F4 by Metavir score, or a liver stiffness measurement of ≥9.5 kPa by Fibroscan®.13

The large number of patients living with the diagnosis and the limited availability of Fibroscan machines in Egypt at that time led to a very long waiting list (which reached more than six months in some centers).

This mandated accepting the use of Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) for assessment of liver fibrosis and considering advanced fibrosis with FIB-4 ≥3.25.7

Patients with no or low fibrosis were not prioritized, even if they were thought to be at high risk of transmission, except healthcare workers (physicians and nurses), who were included regardless of their fibrosis stage.

Patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, post-liver transplant patients, and patients with severe extrahepatic manifestations were also included regardless of fibrosis stage.

PARAGRAPH

Inclusion and exclusion criteria, and interferon eligibility criteria for this cohort were previously detailed.7

Patients with Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score >7 were excluded.

Patients with “history” of ascites or encephalopathy who did not have uncontrolled ascites or overt encephalopathy, or other exclusion criteria at time of evaluation were included.

PARAGRAPH

By May 2015, it became apparent that the prioritization strategy resulted in a large backlog of patients waiting for treatment, which caused administrative and moral difficulties.

With more availability of drugs and the introduction of simeprevir (SMV), and with continuing efforts for price reduction, the NCCVH modified the treatment protocol to include all stages of fibrosis (F0-F4), aiming at scaling-up treatment and including more patients to meet the targets of the initial plan for disease elimination.14–16

Egypt, at that time, became the first country to treat all patients with HCV, regardless of their fibrosis stage.

As the lower response rate to SOF-RBV for 24 weeks started becoming apparent, SOF-SMV for 12 weeks replaced SOF-RBV therapy, while patients who were interferon (IFN) eligible continued to receive SOF-PEG-RBV, which was 40% cheaper than SOF-SMV.

The CTP score limit, however, remained at 7 due to the limitation of the use of SMV in patients with decompensated disease.

PARAGRAPH

With the availability of locally produced generic daclatasvir (DCV) at much lower cost, treatment guidelines were changed to be totally IFN free and based on SOF-DCV, and all patients with CTP B were included.

However, patients with Child C were not treated in the national treatment centers, but were referred to three specialized centers where transplantation is available to be treated if therapy was considered feasible, or to be placed on transplant lists.

They are not included in these cohorts.

PARAGRAPH

Brand DAAs and PEG were used with generic RBV for all patients in cohort-1 and -2.

All patients treated with SOF-DCV with or without RBV starting in cohort-3 received locally produced generic drugs.

PARAGRAPH

To facilitate inclusion of more patients, the evaluation process was simplified, and instead of systematic fibrosis assessment, patients were categorized into two groups (7): an “easy-to-treat” group that included patients without cirrhosis who have not received any previous antiviral treatment for HCV, who were treated with SOF-DCV for 12 weeks, and a “difficult-to-treat” group that included patients with cirrhosis and those who were treatment experienced who received SOF-DCV-RBV for 12 weeks.

PARAGRAPH

Baseline data included patient age, liver biochemical tests, creatinine, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), blood counts, blood glucose, FIB-4, ultrasound assessment of the liver texture, and if available, results of liver biopsy (fibrosis, activity, and steatosis), liver stiffness measured by Fibroscan, and upper endoscopy.

Comorbidities, when present, were recorded.

All comedications were checked for drug-drug-interactions using the University of Liverpool application on smart phones (Liverpool HEP iChart) or the website (http://www.hep-druginteractions.org/checker).

Records of comedications were not analyzed for this report.

PARAGRAPH

Sustained virologic response (SVR12) was defined as the absence of detectable viraemia (HCV-RNA below the limit of detection (<15 IU/ml)) 12 weeks after completion of therapy.

PARAGRAPH

Patients are usually followed up by their local physicians in addition to the hepatitis treatment centers.

All patients receive a voucher for free RNA test to be performed 12 weeks after the end of therapy at one of the Ministry of Health (MoH) laboratories, and are asked to return with the result to the treatment center to record their SVR12 result.

PARAGRAPH

After the low return rate in cohort-1 became apparent, several attempts were made to encourage patients to return to report their SVR results.

These included issuing a “certificate of cure” to be used for employment (for those who had employment issues due to being diagnosed with hepatitis C) and for travel (to countries that prevent issuing visas for persons with hepatitis C).

Another attempt at encouraging patients to return to report their SVR12 test results was offering hepatitis B vaccine at end of treatment to all those who were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative: they were given the first dose of the vaccine at end of treatment, and asked to come back 12 weeks later for the second dose and to record their follow-up HCV-RNA test result.

In cohort-3, attempts were made to contact patients by phone, asking whether they had their test done, and recording the result (assuming that an answer that their RNA test was negative and that they were cured was true).

PARAGRAPH

Patients who failed to respond to SOF-PEG-RBV or SOF-RBV who were CTP A were treated with SOF-SMV in cohort-2, or later with SOF-DCV in cohort-3.

Those who were CTP B waited until the availability of SOF-DCV in cohort-3.

SOF-SMV failures were treated with SOF-DCV-RBV for 12 weeks or SOF-DCV for 24 weeks if RBV ineligible.

Patients who failed to respond in cohort-3 who were CTP A are being retreated with SOF-SMV-DCV ± RBV, or SOF + ritonavir-boosted pariteprevir + ombitasvir ± ribavirin (SOF-PAR-r-OMB ± RBV) for 12 or 24 weeks.

Results of retreatments following DAA failure are not included in this analysis.

They were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA).

Categorical data were presented by number and percent and compared by Chi-square test.

P value was considered significant if less than 0.05.

Baseline patient data, proportion of patients with follow-up data, and SVR12 results are presented and compared between cohorts, and treatment regimens.

Known results of patients with comorbidities are also presented.

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

The timeline for different treatment protocols during the duration of this study is shown (Fig. 1).

The registry included 337,042 patients who started treatment with known baseline data, and who had passed 12 weeks of follow-up after end of therapy during this period.

The first cohort were 120,407 patients (35.7%), cohort-2 were 159,750 patients (47.4%), and cohort-3 were 56,885 patients (16.9%).

In addition, 94,258 patients treated in the two months following cohort-3 have follow-up data presented.

PARAGRAPH

Baseline data are shown (Table 1 and Tables S1–S3).

Patients were significantly older in cohort-1 (64% older than 50 years) compared to cohort-2 and -3.

Males out-numbered females in the first cohort, genders were almost equal in the second cohort, and were more females in the last cohort.

PARAGRAPH

More interferon experienced patients were among cohort-1 (18.9% vs. 6.8% for each of cohort-2 and -3) (Table 1), and cohort-1 patients had higher baseline alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, INR and AFP, and lower platelets and albumin compared to cohort-2 and -3 (Table S1).

PARAGRAPH

Although inclusion criteria were set to include only patients with F3-F4 fibrosis in cohort-1, of the 24,148 patients in cohort-1 who had liver biopsy results, 9,092 had F0-F2 (Table S2).

These were either included by error (mostly), or were healthcare workers or had comorbidities exempt from the inclusion criteria.

PARAGRAPH

Cohort-1 included patients with higher rates of comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension and alcohol intake, (17.34%) compared to groups 2 and 3 (13.8% and 12.19%), and included more transplant recipients, patients with autoimmune diseases, extrahepatic manifestations, were on dialysis, or had HIV co-infection as they were eligible for priority treatment regardless of their liver fibrosis stage (Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

The proportion of patients with known outcomes in each cohort and within each treatment regimen is shown (Table 2 and Fig. 2).

Overall, 28% of the 337,042 patients had a known SVR12 result.

The proportion increased from 15.1% among cohort-1 patients to 67.7% in cohort-3 patients.

This further increased to 75.4% among the 94,258 patients in the additional group.

Among each treatment regimen, follow-up improved with each cohort.

PARAGRAPH

In a treatment center that contacted all patients who missed their post-treatment follow-up visit (Table S4): of 5,470 patients: 27 discontinued treatment, 148 were non-responders, 2,756 reported their post-treatment 12-week result: 65 had relapsed, and 2,691 had achieved SVR12 (SVR12 rate for patients with known follow-up 91.8%).

The 2,539 patients who did not return for their post-treatment week-12 follow-up were contacted by phone: and 2,415 patients were reached and reported that they had their RNA test done at post-treatment week-12 or beyond, and were told that the result was negative (SVR 95.1%, overall SVR 93.3%).

PARAGRAPH

SVR12 results for patients whose data were available are presented (Table 3).

The combination of SOF-RBV for 24 weeks had the lowest SVR12 rate (SVR12 82.7% vs. 93.9% for SOF-PEG-RBV, 97.4% for SOF-SMV, 97.8% for SOF-DCV, and 97.6% for SOF-DCV-RBV).

Predictors of treatment failure are shown (Table S5).

Known SVR12 results of patients with comorbidities are shown (Table S6).

The presence of diabetes, hypertension, HBsAg or HIV co-infection, previous hepatocellular carcinoma, chemotherapy or liver transplantation or being on dialysis did not impair response to therapy.

PARAGRAPH

Treatment outcomes with brand and generic medications are shown (Table S7).

Generic drugs (SOF-DCV in cohort-3) were associated with higher SVR rates (98.4%) than brand medications (SOF-PEG-RBV, SOF-RBV 24 week, SOF-SMV).

Results of retreatment of DAA failures are not included in this analysis.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

We share the success and difficulties of the Egyptian strategy for managing the largest national HCV treatment program, suggesting policies that can be implemented in similar resource-limited countries.

PARAGRAPH

Through the NCCVH, the MoH started the national treatment program for HCV in 2007, based on PEG-RBV.

This, coupled with the set-up of specialized digitally connected HCV treatment centers in MoH facilities, were the infrastructure that facilitated the introduction and implementation of mass treatment with the availability of DAAs.17

PARAGRAPH

The limited supply of SOF initially, in addition to the cost (though greatly reduced to US$ 900 for a 12 weeks treatment, yet relatively high in relation to the limited resources of the country) necessitated prioritizing treatment for patients with F3 and F4 fibrosis, and to patients with additional comorbidities.17,18

This is reflected in the characteristics of the first cohort of patients compared to the subsequent two cohorts who were included when more drugs became available and costs decreased further.

PARAGRAPH

Liver biopsy results were available for 21% of cohort-1 patients compared to 3% of cohort-2 and 1% of cohort-3.

This represents biopsies that were performed while preparing patients for previous interferon therapy, where treatment was deferred for patients with F4 fibrosis.

As fibrosis stage was initially required to be assessed with the introduction of SOF, 17.5% of cohort-1 patients had Fibroscan done.

FIB-4 was then accepted as a method of assessing fibrosis mid-way through cohort-1, and with total removal of rigorous fibrosis assessment in cohort-2 and -3, the percentage of patients having Fibroscan pretreatment decreased to 5% then 1% in cohort-2 and -3.

Other differences between cohort-1 patients and the other cohorts are features of the prioritization and selection policy.

PARAGRAPH

Although all patients received a voucher for a free RNA test, to be performed 12 weeks after the end of therapy at one of the MoH laboratories, the proportion of patients who returned voluntarily to report their SVR12 result was initially very low.

Most patients had their week-12 post-treatment RNA test result reviewed by their local physicians, and most of those who achieved an SVR did not return to the treatment centers to report cure.

Most patients who relapsed, on the other hand, returned to the centers to be evaluated for re-treatment.

PARAGRAPH

The very low return rate for SVR12 reporting, prompted the issuance of the “certificate of cure”, and the HBV vaccination of HBsAg negative patients, which slightly improved the proportion of patients with known outcome.

However, contacting patients by phone worked better still in cohort-3 and subsequent patients.

The proportion of patients with known outcome increased from less than 25% in cohort-1 and -2, to 67% for cohort-3 and 75% thereafter.

The high response rate among patients who did not return spontaneously to report their SVR result and were reached by phone in one of the centers indicates that the SVR rate of patients who came for follow-up is probably representative of the whole cohort.

However, the program did not exert sufficient effort in emphasizing the importance of reporting the SVR12 result, and did not facilitate reporting by creating toll-free dedicated phone numbers to easily report results.

This was a major administrative oversight on the part of the program.

PARAGRAPH

Although incompleteness of data is a feature of real-world reports, initial follow-up in this program was very low.

Rates improved in subsequent cohorts, but even this is far from ideal.

The ideal solution would be linking laboratories (including private laboratories where patients have their tests done all over the country) electronically to the national program database via a cloud interface, linking all HCV test results in all laboratories to the national ID number (a unique person identifier that is similar to the social security number), and permitting all laboratories to upload results to the national program database.

This needs huge infrastructure and logistic efforts, and is beyond the current means and resources of the national program with the numbers of patients treated.

This would be an ideal solution for countries beginning a similar program who have fewer patients and better electronic and communication infrastructure.

PARAGRAPH

The outcome of different treatment regimens reported here cannot be compared, as the prioritization and assignment criteria resulted in more patients with advanced disease in cohort-1, and patients with F0-F2 were only included in cohort-2 and -3, which biases towards better response rates for these patients.

Similarly, we cannot compare “brand” to “generic” medications, as brand medications were used mainly in cohort-1 patients, where patients with advanced fibrosis were included, including those treated with SOF-RBV for 24 weeks with its associated sub-optimal response.

Conversely, generic medications were used in cohort-3, where patients had less advanced liver disease.

Our results should only be taken as an indication that generic medications “do work” and have high response rates.

PARAGRAPH

Our real-world results presented here for SOF-PEG-RBV and SOF-SMV compare to published results of clinical trials in HCV-GT4.5,12

However, 24 weeks of SOF-RBV used in cohort-1 and briefly in cohort-2, was associated with a lower SVR12 rate at 82.7%.

In clinical trials, the same regimen in HCV-GT4 patients was associated with SVR rates of 90%–94%.10,19

This is probably a feature of the assignment criteria during cohort-1, where patients who had more advanced disease and were IFN ineligible were treated with this combination.

PARAGRAPH

The co-existing comorbidities described indicate that these cohorts were representative of a real-life population with many associated conditions.

The high SVR rate shows that patients with HCV infection could be treated despite the presence of these associated conditions.

PARAGRAPH

Several recent publications presented real-world results for the use of DAAs in patients with HCV, mostly reporting results of patients with HCV-GT1.20–27

SVR12 results of treatment with SOF-LDV or PAR-r in combination with OMB and dasabuvir (PAR-r-OMB-DSB) with or without RBV were above 95%20–23 even in older patients with cirrhosis.23

SVR12 results of patients infected with HCV-GT1, treated with SOF-SMV, were lower at 84%,27 with lower results in patients with cirrhosis.24,25

Only few reports included real-world results of patients with HCV-GT4.

Data from the German registry for using PAR-r ± OMB ± DSB ± RBV showed that all 53 treated patients with HCV-GT4 achieved an SVR12,26 and a meta-analysis of real-world results of using the same combination from data published from several countries showed >98% SVR rate for HCV-GT4.25

A Spanish report that included patients treated with SOF-SMV showed a 91% SVR rate in HCV-GT4 patients, with higher response in patients with less advanced liver disease in whom the SVR12 rate was higher than 95%.27

Our SVR12 results using SOF-SMV were higher at 97%, but our patients were mostly treatment naive, and if they had cirrhosis, they were mostly Child A.

PARAGRAPH

Although reports indicate that patients with decompensated cirrhosis can improve with IFN free DAA therapy,30 some patients experience disease worsening and decompensation on or after treatment.30–33

Patients with decompensated cirrhosis were not included in the treatment program.

The initial CTP cut-off was 7 for the first two cohorts.

With the introduction of SOF-DCV in the third cohort, CTP cut-off was increased to 9.

Patients with Child C were not included, but were referred to three specialized centers with the capability to perform transplants, to be treated if therapy was considered feasible, or to be listed for transplantation if they had a suitable donor (only living-donor-transplantation is practiced in Egypt).

They are not included in these cohorts.

Indeed, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines state that “patients with HCV infection who have decompensated cirrhosis (moderate or severe hepatic impairment; CTP class B or C) should be referred to a medical practitioner with expertise in that condition (ideally in a liver transplant center)”.33

PARAGRAPH

Herein, we have reported the first real-world results of using SOF-DCV in HCV-GT4.

Notably, clinical trials with this combination included only handfuls of HCV-GT4 patients, who mostly all responded to treatment.28,29

The high response rate with this combination of generic drugs at a cost of less than $100 for a 12 week-treatment demonstrates how resource-limited countries can manage their HCV problem.

PARAGRAPH

Despite these successes and the high SVR rate with most treatment regimens used, the program faced several difficulties that caused backlogs and delays, were not anticipated, and had to be managed as they occurred.

The Egyptian national program for treating hepatitis C can thus send several messages and share several limitations with countries of similar settings, helping them to avoid such issues, saving them time and resources.

PARAGRAPH

The initial difficulty was scheduling patients for evaluation and treatment, With the introduction of new treatments with cohort-1, the NCCVH estimated that there were more than 750,000 patients living with the diagnosis and waiting for the new medications, and the initial demand and anticipated numbers were beyond the capacity of the then available 26 national treatment centers.

This necessitated a novel administration solution: a web-based online registration system was developed for patient registration and scheduling appointments according to each center’s capacity.

Patients appointments were automatically set to the first time available in the treatment center nearest to their residence as detailed previously.9

This was pivotal in easing and streamlining patient visits.

PARAGRAPH

Prioritizing patients with advanced fibrosis proved to be an administrative and moral issue, and resulted in a backlog of several hundred thousand patients with less advanced disease.

Prioritization was needed only when the supply of medication was limited.

With sufficient supply, all patients with HCV should be treated, regardless of the stage of fibrosis.

PARAGRAPH

The program has been cost-driven, and guidelines were repeatedly modified with the availability of cheaper and generic medications.

The cost of diagnostics, on the other hand, remains an important part of the total cost to the program, and will remain a problem as long as there are no cheaper or generic alternatives.

Simplifying the current testing schedule is essential and will result in significant savings.

Non-invasive biochemical assessment of fibrosis (FIB-4 in this report) was suitable and practical for evaluating the huge number of patients.

Whether this is sufficient for planning further follow-up of patients with cirrhosis is not known.

PARAGRAPH

The main limitation of this analysis was the low rate of patients returning to report SVR results.

Although this improved slightly, an elaborate solution for tracking laboratory results of missing patients nationwide is still lacking, and would be ideal for any new system.

PARAGRAPH

Lastly, cheap generic alternatives are effective, were the reason for the large number of patients treated, and are a suitable option for countries of similarly limited resources.
