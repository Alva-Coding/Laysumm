ABSTRACT

TITLE

Insulin sensitizer MSDC-0602K in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb study

PARAGRAPH

MSDC-0602K is a novel insulin sensitizer designed to preferentially target the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier while minimizing direct binding to the transcriptional factor PPARγ.

Herein, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of MSDC-0602K in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

PARAGRAPH

Patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH and fibrosis (F1-F3) were randomized to daily oral placebo, or 1 of 3 MSDC-0602K doses in a 52-week double-blind study.

The primary efficacy endpoint was hepatic histological improvement of ≥2 points in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) with a ≥1-point reduction in either ballooning or lobular inflammation and no increase in fibrosis stage at 12 months.

Secondary endpoints included NAS improvement without worsening fibrosis, NASH resolution, and fibrosis reduction.

Exploratory endpoints included changes in insulin sensitivity, liver injury and liver fibrosis markers.

PARAGRAPH

Patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 94), or 62.5 mg (n = 99), 125 mg (n = 98), or 250 mg (n = 101) of MSDC-0602K.

At baseline, glycated hemoglobin was 6.4 ± 1.0%, 61.5% of patients had fibrosis F2/F3 and the average NAS was 5.3.

The primary endpoint was reached in 29.7%, 29.8%, 32.9% and 39.5% of patients in the placebo, 62.5 mg, 125 mg and 250 mg dose arms, respectively, with adjusted odds ratios relative to placebo of 0.89 (95% CI 0.44–1.81), 1.22 (95% CI 0.60–2.48), and 1.64 (95% CI 0.83–3.27).

The 2 highest doses of MSDC-0602K led to significant reductions in glucose, glycated hemoglobin, insulin, liver enzymes and NAS compared to placebo.

The incidence of hypoglycemia and PPARγ-agonist-associated events such as edema and fractures were similar in the placebo and MSDC-0602K groups.

PARAGRAPH

MSDC-0602K did not demonstrate statistically significant effects on primary and secondary liver histology endpoints.

However, effects on non-invasive measures of liver cell injury and glucose metabolism support further exploration of MSDC-0602K’s safety and potential efficacy in patients with type 2 diabetes and liver injury. [
