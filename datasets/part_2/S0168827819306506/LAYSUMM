TITLE

Insulin sensitizer MSDC-0602K in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb study

PARAGRAPH

First-generation insulin sensitizers are used to treat type 2 diabetes, but are associated with side effects including edema, bone fractures, and hypoglycemia.

MSDC-0602K is a second-generation insulin sensitizer designed to reduce these side effects.

We hypothesized that insulin sensitization could improve non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

In the current study of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, MSDC-0602K did not demonstrate significant effects on liver histology with the biopsy techniques used.

However, useful information was gained for the design of future studies and MSDC-0602K significantly decreased fasting glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin, and markers of liver injury without dose-limiting side effects.
