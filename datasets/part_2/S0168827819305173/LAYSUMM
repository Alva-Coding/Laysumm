TITLE

TNF-α/IFN-γ profile of HBV-specific CD4 T cells is associated with liver damage and viral clearance in chronic HBV infection

PARAGRAPH

TNF-α producing cells are the dominant population of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific CD4 T cells in patients with chronic HBV infection.

This population of cells might contribute to the aggravation of liver damage in patients with a hepatitis B flare.

HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells are associated with HBV viral clearance.

Differentiation from HBV-specific TNF-α producing CD4 T cells into HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells might favor HBV viral clearance.
