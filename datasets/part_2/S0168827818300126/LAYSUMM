TITLE

Irradiation stents vs. conventional metal stents for unresectable malignant biliary obstruction: A multicenter trial

PARAGRAPH

For patients with unresectable malignant biliary obstruction (MBO), placement of a self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) is a recommended palliative modality to relieve pruritus, cholangitis, pain, and jaundice.

However, restenosis is a main pitfall after stent placement.

Data from this first multicenter randomized controlled trial showed that insertion of an irradiation stent provided longer patency and better survival than a conventional metal stent.
