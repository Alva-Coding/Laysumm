ABSTRACT

TITLE

SEC14L2, a lipid-binding protein, regulates HCV replication in culture with inter- and intra-genotype variations

PARAGRAPH

The lipid-binding protein, SEC14L2, is crucial for the efficient viral replication of clinical hepatitis C virus (HCV) isolates in cell culture.

Given the role of SEC14L2 in HCV replication, we aimed to study a large number of HCV positive sera carrying genotypes 1–4, to identify viral factors associated with efficient replication in culture.

Additionally, we investigated whether 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SEC14L2 have an impact on RNA replication of naturally occurring HCV isolates.

PARAGRAPH

We generated Huh-7.5 cell lines overexpressing SEC14L2 or 13 coding SNPs and tested 73 different HCV positive sera for in vitro replication.

Furthermore, we genotyped a cohort of 262 patients with chronic HCV for the common SNP (rs757660) and investigated its effect on the clinical phenotype.

PARAGRAPH

HCV isolates from genotype 1, 2, 3 and 4 replicate in Huh-7.5 cells overexpressing SEC14L2.

Interestingly, only subgenomic replicons from genotypes 1 and 3 showed enhanced replication whereas genotypes 2 and 4 remained unaffected.

Furthermore, replication was independent of viral load.

Importantly, all tested SNPs supported HCV RNA replication in vitro, while 1 SNP was associated with decreased SEC1L2 expression and viral RNA.

All SNPs exhibited comparable cellular cholesterol and vitamin E abundance in naïve Huh-7.5 cells.

PARAGRAPH

This large screen of natural HCV isolates of 4 genotypes underscores the relevance of SEC14L2 as an in vitro HCV host factor.

Additionally, SEC14L2 variants appear to recapitulate the wild-type enhancement of HCV replication.

Variant rs191341134 showed a decreased effect due to lowered stability, whereas variant rs757660, a high prevalence mutant, showed a similar phenotype to the wild-type.
