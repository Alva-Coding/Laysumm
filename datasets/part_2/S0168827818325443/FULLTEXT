TITLE

SEC14L2, a lipid-binding protein, regulates HCV replication in culture with inter- and intra-genotype variations

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive stranded RNA Hepacivirus in the Flaviviridae family.

Today, HCV remains an important element in the aetiology of chronic liver disease and according to the World Health Organization there are estimated to be 71 million chronically infected patients worldwide.1

Since the discovery of the virus in 1989, the development of tools such as a subgenomic replicon system, cell culture adapted variants and highly permissive hepatoma cell lines have enabled researchers to study different aspects of the HCV life cycle.

This paved the way for the generation of effective antiviral therapies against the virus.2,3

Nevertheless, replication of non-cell culture adapted variants remained a difficult achievement and later facets of the viral life cycle are yet to be fully described.

This status quo was challenged in 2015 when pan-genotype (GT) replication of patient-derived isolates was shown by Saeed et al.

They were able to show that the overexpression of the lipid-binding protein SEC14L2 in a Huh-7.5 hepatoma cell line allowed efficient replication of non-cell culture adapted HCV isolates, through a vitamin E mediated mechanism of lipid peroxidation resistance.4

Curiously vitamin E supplementation was not sufficient to allow replicon colony formation in the absence of SEC14L2 which would suggest an alternative mechanism may be at play.

The context of lipid peroxidation as a regulatory mechanism of HCV had already been suggested by Yamane et al.

Yamane and co-authors showed that sphingosine kinase-2 partly regulated lipid peroxidation and the data implied a significant role of this regulation upon HCV replication.

The EC50 of tested HCV antivirals was shown to increase in the presence of vitamin E or the sphingosine kinase inhibitor.5

Further data on the subject of non-cell culture adapted virus replication were made available in 2016 when a mechanism for viral dependence on host phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIα (PI4KA) was reported to be a determinant factor in hepatoma cell lines.

Harak et al. were able to show that adaptive mutations with loss of function in NS5A-NS5B were necessary for efficient replication in hepatoma cell lines.

The difference in the expression of PI4KA, and consequently, the abundance of PiP4, were pointed out as being detrimental for viral replication as they were present in excess when comparing model hepatoma cell lines with primary human hepatocytes.6

Together these new data provided an important understanding of the role of host factors and lipid peroxidation in the life cycle of HCV, chief among them, SEC14L2.

PARAGRAPH

SEC14L2 is a human homologue of a lipid-binding protein first described in mice in 1977 as supernatant protein factor.7

This protein is closely related to yeast sec14p proteins and it is characterized by a CRAL-TRIO domain.

It has been reported to function as a putative transporter of lipophilic molecules between cellular compartments and to be intimately connected to the availability of vitamin E.8,9 It is characterized by high expression levels in the brain, prostate and the liver.10

Several authors have attributed a role in vitamin E distribution in the cytosol and in the abundance of vitamin E in serum to SEC14L2/hTAP.11–13

PARAGRAPH

A common coding single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in SEC14L2 (rs757660) has been associated with alpha-tocopherol levels in the serum and the risk of prostate cancer.13

but the impact of this SEC14L2 variant on HCV has not been addressed so far.

At least 13 validated coding non-synonymous SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of at least 0.0002, each resulting in the exchange of a single amino acid in the SEC14L2 protein have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information dbSNP database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp) (Table 1).

If these SNPs have a clinical phenotype is presently unknown.

PARAGRAPH

Given the central role of SEC14L2 in HCV replication we aimed to study a larger number of sera from HCV RNA positive individuals infected with HCV GT 1–4 in order to identify factors that are associated with efficient replication in cell culture.

In addition, we investigated if genetic variants of SEC14L2 may have an impact on RNA replication of natural occurring HCV isolates.

As previously stated, there are unanswered questions regarding HCV replication in the presence of SEC14L2, chief among them, the variation of efficiency in inter- and intragenotypic HCV replication and the inability of vitamin E to independently allow for replicon colony formation.4

For this purpose, we generated Huh-7.5 cell lines overexpressing wild-type isoform 1 SEC14L2 or 13 coding SNPs selected by MAF.

Furthermore, we genotyped a cohort of 262 patients with chronic HCV for a common SNP (rs757660) and investigated its effect on the clinical phenotype.

Overall, our data indicate that SEC14L2 elicited HCV replication varies within HCV GT and that all tested SEC14L2 SNPs support HCV RNA replication in vitro, while 1 SNP was associated with lower SEC1L2 expression and decreased viral titers.

Analysis of HCV non-structural protein variants

PARAGRAPH

Partial NS3 and NS5A sequences were retrieved by Sanger sequencing.

A detailed protocol is available upon request.

These are mapped to the N terminal regions of NS3 and NS5A and map to relevant resistance determinant regions of the virus.

Using multiple sequence alignment software Ugene,19 we compared the amino acid sequences of the replicating and non-replicating viruses and elected residues based on comparative analysis between replicating and/or non-replicating and the consensus sequence from the alignment with database sequences from the European HCV database (euHCVdb).20

The selected residue frequency was then calculated.

Phylogenetic analysis was conducted with MEGA74 using maximum likelihood method with the Poisson amino acid substitution model.

Initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using a JTT model.

A discrete gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (6 categories and the rate variation model allowed for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable).

Robustness of the trees was tested via bootstrap method with 1,000 replicates.

Results

SECTION

Sufficient HCV RNA replication of isolates from HCV positive patients in Huh-7.5 cells expressing SEC14L2 depends on HCV GT

PARAGRAPH

Saeed et al. showed replication of 6 high-titer HCV sera from HCV GT1a, GT1b and GT3a in SEC14L2 expressing cells.16,21,22

However, data encompassing a broader range of viral loads and HCV GTs would complement this interesting experiment.

Therefore, we first investigated replication of 73 patient-derived HCV isolates from GT1 to 4 in Huh-7.5 cells expressing SEC14L2.

Firstly, a lentiviral expression system was adapted to generate novel cell lines stably expressing SEC14L2.

Afterwards, Huh-7.5 harboring an empty vector as well as the novel cell line expressing SEC14L2 were infected with different patient sera.

Overall, 45% of the tested isolates replicated in Huh-7.5_SEC14L2 cells (Fig. 1A).

Cells infected with GT1 GT2 and GT3 isolates showed SEC14L2 enhancement of replication, importantly, some isolates exhibited replication in the absence of SEC14L2 (Fig. 1A).

79% of all tested HCV GT3 isolates, 50% of the tested GT2 isolates and 60% of tested GT1 isolates were able to replicate in Huh-7.5 SEC14L2.

In contrast, only 19% of GT4 samples replicated in culture.

PARAGRAPH

Overall these data highlight that HCV GT3, GT2 and GT isolates replicate in hepatoma cells expressing human SEC14L2.

GT4 isolates exhibited limited ability to replicate in our model.

SECTION

Viral replication in Huh-7.5 SEC14L2 is independent of viral load

PARAGRAPH

We next aimed to understand why some natural occurring isolates can replicate in cell culture and others do not.

To gather data to approach this question we compared the viral load (Fig. 1B) and storage time (Fig. 1C) of the 75 sera and matched it with the ability to replicate in Huh-7.5 SEC14L2 cells.

We observed that even isolates with older collection dates (GDH to GDT) were able to replicate in our model.

Crucially, we extracted RNA from high-titer serum samples GDS and GDT, which exhibited detectable replication in the empty vector and SEC14L2 cell lines respectively, and electroporated Huh-7.5 cells harboring SEC14L2 with these RNAs.

We did not observe enhancement of replication when compared to the replication deficient Jc1ΔGDD (Fig. S1).

PARAGRAPH

Taken together these data suggest that viral load is not a reliable predictor of the replicative phenotype of isolates used to infect cells harboring SEC14L2.

Interestingly, storage conditions post collection may negatively influence the stability of the viral particle, especially in the case of GT4 isolates from the GDE collection, where samples collected in 2007 and before, when coupled with storage at −20 °C, failed to replicate in the presence of SEC14L2.

SECTION

Comparative analysis of partial NS3 and NS5A sequences from replicating vs. non-replicating isolates

PARAGRAPH

We compiled partial NS3 and NS5A sequence data obtained from resistance clinical testing and recorded amino acid differences.

Firstly, we compared replicating samples vs. non-replicating samples and used phylogeny to establish relationships between the coding sequences.

The phylogenetic tree exhibited GT determined clustering both for NS3 (Fig. 2A) and NS5A (Fig. 2B).

Following these steps, we determined the prevalence of selected residues by multiple sequence alignment with data collected from the euHCVdb and checked for correlations between the replication phenotype and prevalence of the mutations in the analyzed populations.

Additionally, we compared a subset of adaptive mutations from the literature to the available regions.4,5

The selected mutations from the literature were not present in the surveyed regions of the serum samples.

Using comparative analysis, we analyzed the sequences and noted 7 residues in NS5A which were differentially distributed among replicating and non-replicating clusters which may be of relevance to the phenotype, substantiating the observed variation in Fig. 1A. Additionally, we identified 2 residues in the NS3 of the highly replicating GM3 isolate that were of low prevalence in the remaining available NS3 sequences.

(Fig. 2C).

PARAGRAPH

Ultimately, single point mutations in NS3 and/or NS5A that correlated with efficient in vitro replication were absent in our analysis, nevertheless, we identified several residues that warrant further study, i.e. S62L was absent from replicating samples and present in the non-replicating GT3 sample GE14 (Fig. 2C).

SECTION

Generation of Huh-7.5 cell lines expressing SEC14L2 polymorphisms

PARAGRAPH

The SNP database (dbSNP) contains 13 coding non-synonymous SNPs in the human SEC14L2 gene that are each expected to result in the exchange of a single amino acid in the SEC14L2 protein (Table 1, Fig. 3A).

Polymorphisms were selected using a biased approach based on protein localization and minor allele frequency, with preference given to higher reported MAF.

Interestingly, rs757660 has a MAF of 0.37 of the screened population according to the 1000 genomes database (www.1000genomes.org; Table 1).

Other coding variants had lower MAF with an incidence ranging from 0.0002 to 0.0134.

To study the impact of these SEC14L2 polymorphisms on HCV replication we generated Huh-7.5 cell lines expressing SEC14L2 isoform 1 variants.

To achieve persistent expression of the desired proteins we employed a lentiviral monocistronic and a lentiviral bicistronic expression system carrying the gene of interest (GOI) or the GOI and a GFP protein where the GFP expression was downstream of an IRES.

Both vectors carried an antibiotic resistance gene.

SEC14L2 variant expression levels were measured by western blot and flow cytometry (Fig. 3B).

While all cell lines have been successfully transduced, we were only able to detect SEC14L2 SNP rs191341134 protein in non-denaturing conditions (Fig. S2).

SECTION

Huh-7.5 SEC14L2 variant rs191341134 is associated with reduced viral replication in vitro

PARAGRAPH

Each of the cell lines with different SEC14L2 variants were infected with high viral titer GT1a, GT1b or GT3a patient sera normalized to 3x106 IU/ml.

Afterwards, viral RNA content was quantified using a qPCR approach.

Specificity of replication was controlled through the use of biological replicates supplemented with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs, sofosbuvir and daclatasvir).

All SNPs exhibited a marked enhancement in replication when compared to the levels found in the empty vector control (Fig. 3C) when infected with a GT1b or GT3a serum sample.

However, SNPs rs201172275, rs140683265, rs201989594, rs144995453, rs200123712, rs182488695 and rs191341134 did not yield detectable viral replication when infected with our GT1a serum sample.

Interestingly, in GT1b and GT3a infected cells, replication levels were equivalent in 12 of the 13 polymorphism harboring cell lines and the wild-type.

In the case of rs191341134, replication was 1 log10 inferior when compared to the wild-type SEC14L2 cell lines.

PARAGRAPH

Overall these data indicate that all SEC14L2 SNPs can support HCV RNA replication of HCV GT1b and GT3a.

Importantly, rs191341134 was associated with reduced viral replication.

Additionally, several SNPs of SEC14L2 exhibited altered replication of a unique GT1a isolate.

SECTION

A common SNP rs757660 can promote viral replication in vitro

PARAGRAPH

SNP rs757660 exhibits a very high prevalence in the human population.

Comparatively the remaining selected 12 SNPs have a much lower allele frequency (Table 1).

Taking this observation into consideration we investigated the effect of this SNP on HCV replication of GTs 1 to 5 by using a subgenomic replicon model.

Replication was measured at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h postexposure and normalized to 4 h post electroporation.

As shown in Fig. 4A, an enhancing effect of SEC14L2 wild-type or SNP rs757660 on viral replication was seen for GT1a, GT1b and GT3a isolates, while there was no significant difference in viral replication of GT2a, GT4a and GT5a.

Overall, the enhancing effect of rs757660 was comparable with SEC14L2 wild-type.

PARAGRAPH

To further investigate if viral replication of natural occurring viruses is affected by this SNP, we infected Huh-7.5 cell lines expressing wild-type SEC14L2 and variant rs757660 with a panel of 35 different sera derived from HCV infected patients (GT 1–4).

Specificity of replication was controlled using biological replicates supplemented with a DAA cocktail containing sofosbuvir and daclatasvir.

In line with Fig. 1A and B, viral replication was observed in 31% of the tested sera without any significant differences between SEC14L2 wild-type and the SNP (Fig. 4B).

For GT2, we again observed no detectable replication, although the small number of samples containing this GT must be considered when interpreting these data.

Interestingly, 2 HCV isolates (GT 3a and 4a) showed viral replication in Huh-7.5 cells expressing the SNP in contrast to SEC14L2 wild-type.

PARAGRAPH

Overall these data indicate that rs757660 exhibits a phenotype comparable to that of wild-type SEC14L2.

SECTION

SNPs in SEC14L2 exhibit equivalent vitamin E, ROS and cholesterol phenotypes

PARAGRAPH

Next, we wanted to further investigate if these SNPs in SEC14L2 may alter its function as a vitamin E binding protein and may change the amount of intracellular vitamin E concentrations.

We measured the content of vitamin E of all cell lines expressing either wild-type SEC14L2 or its variants using a competitive ELISA.

We did not observe any statistically significant vitamin E content in the analyzed samples (Fig. 5A).

In addition, we also quantified the presence of reactive oxygen species in rs757660 to investigate a relationship between the variation of lipid peroxidation, previously reported to be a significant factor inhibiting viral replication in Huh-7.5 cells,4,5 and the presence of this SNP.

Importantly, we did not observe a statistically significant variation in the cytosolic presence of reactive oxygen species in rs757660 (Fig. 5B).

Additionally, we also performed total cholesterol quantification.

Overall, we did not observe significant differences in total cholesterol content between wild-type SEC14, polymorphism harboring cell lines and empty vector control (Fig. 5C).

SECTION

Effects of SNP rs757660 on clinical parameters

PARAGRAPH

As SEC14L2 has been shown to be an important host factor for HCV RNA replication, we questioned if SNPs in the protein may alter the clinical course of HCV infection.

To answer this, we genotyped a subset of 262 samples of the INDIV2 cohort of patients infected with HCV GT1 for the most frequent coding SNP in SEC14L2, rs757660, which exhibits a prevalence of 37% according to 1000genomes.

We correlated all available clinical data to the SEC14L2 genotype of the analyzed patients to uncover any relationship between SEC14L2 and high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, sustained virologic response, end of treatment response, body mass index, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, hemoglobin, white blood cells and HCV load.

In line with our in vitro data we did not observe an association between the SEC14L2 rs757660 polymorphism and the selected markers (Table 2).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

This study offers a perspective on the correlation between variation of SEC14L2 and pan-GT viral replication in vitro.

We aimed to extend the available information on the effect of SEC14L2 on the viral life cycle using patient and laboratory derived strains.

Following the work of Saeed et al, SEC14L2 emerged as a promising target for research for its role in enabling pan-GT replication of HCV in cell culture.

These data reaffirmed that HCV was susceptible to lipid peroxidation and the virus would replicate more efficiently in the presence of vitamin E, a powerful lipophilic antioxidant.

In the same study, the influence of SEC14L2 in the cholesterol synthesis was ruled out as a justification for the observed replicative phenotype as well as the influence of the AKT/PI3K pathway in Huh-7.5 cells.23–25

PARAGRAPH

At a first stage we aimed to reproduce the pan-GT replication while employing a larger number of patient samples of 4 distinct GTs (Table 3).

Interestingly, replication was highly efficient in isolates from GT1, GT2 and GT3 (with the highest efficiency in GT3) whereas the replicating samples of GT4 were lower in number.

These results were supported by the observations using the subgenomic replicon system.

Furthermore, these data are in line with Saeed et al. who also found the largest number of infected cells for GT3a, followed by GT1b isolates.4

PARAGRAPH

Data on the correlation between serum collection, storage date, viral load and the observed level of replication did not yield a clear link between these variables, suggesting that they are not the causative factors of the observed replicative phenotype.

Nonetheless, none of the samples collected before 2007 and stored at −20 °C exhibited measurable replication.

This implies that storage duration and conditions may be relevant to the success of patient-derived isolate replication in the cell culture model.

Together these data point towards additional determinants, other than lipid peroxidation, that fully explain the discrepancies in the percentage of replicating isolates per GT.

One can rule out at a first step, potential HCV core interactions as the patient-derived results are supported in the subgenomic replicon model.

In this model, HCV core interaction with the host lipid machinery should be absent, which precludes endogenous peroxidation from enhanced lipid metabolism driven by core interaction.6

This observation strongly supports the idea that any further viral requirement for replication, including naturally occurring adaptive mutations, should be located downstream of the structural proteins.

PARAGRAPH

An interesting addition to this discussion was provided with the publication by Harak et al. where a mechanism for the modulation of HCV replication in the hepatoma cell culture system by the expression levels of PI4KA was described.26–28

This study extended the outlook on HCV replication efficiency in vitro and showed that, for this application, replication is not an exclusive function of lipid peroxidation resistance but an interplay of multiple host pathways.

This is in accordance with previous work that showed NS5A interactions with the phosphoinositide signaling pathways were necessary to establish efficient viral replication, specifically, the pan-GT requirement of PI4Kα expression and the GT1 specific requirement for PI4KIIIβ.16,21,22

To further enrich this discussion, more experiments would have to be performed to research whether the enhancement achieved by tuning PI4KA expression levels would add or coalesce to the effects of vitamin E and SEC14L2 mediated lipid peroxidation resistance.

After successfully establishing the model for replication in the wild-type SEC14L2 cells, we aimed to extend the observations to 13 SEC14L2 SNPs that have been described in humans.

Using high viral load, GT1a, GT1b and GT3a patient isolates we tested several SEC14L2 SNPs.

Interestingly, rs191341134 elicited lower replication when compared to the wild-type SEC14L2.

Our western blot data (Figs. 3B and S2) suggest that this SNP might be less stable than other SEC14L2 variants which result in lower levels of the protein, which in turn correlates with a lowered replication enhancing effect.

Prompted by the observation that only a fraction of clinical isolates were able to replicate in the presence of SEC14L2, we compiled available viral sequences of NS3 and NS5A to perform genetic analysis of the employed viral isolates to attempt to understand this observation.

Expectedly, proteins clustered according to GT in the phylogenetic analysis which indicates that there are no major changes in the surveyed regions of the proteins that would justify the observed phenotype.

Additionally, adaptive mutations13,29 from relevant laboratory strains were absent from the observed regions in the replicating samples, which suggests that this is not the explanation for the observed replicative phenotypes.

Importantly, complete sequences were not available, so we cannot completely exclude the role of mutations in downstream regions of NS3, NS5A or the remaining non-structural proteins.

After MSA comparing the distribution of the elected residues in the NS5A protein of GT3a from this study against the database sequences, we noted residues that occurred in replicating samples were consistently present in all replicating samples of the same GT and exhibited a relatively high prevalence in the database samples, whereas the residues identified in the non-replicating sample exhibited low overall prevalence in the database samples (Fig. 2), this distribution is consistent with the observed high number of GT3a isolates that exhibited enhanced replication in the presence of SEC14L2, nonetheless, further sequence data would be necessary to formulate a conclusion.

In the case of NS5A from GT1 isolates, the elected residue although present in the replicating sample exhibited a low prevalence in the database samples, this is in accordance with the lower number of replicating samples observed from GT1 comparatively to GT3.

Next generation sequencing as a follow-up would be an interesting tool to address amino acid sequence distribution.

We could analyze sequences pre and post infection to further our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of viral isolates in the presence of SEC14L2.

Given previous reports on the predictive role of vitamin E in prostate cancer patients and tocopherol concentration in the blood,6 we decided to investigate the role of a high prevalence polymorphism of SEC14L2 in a clinical setting, as this protein enhances vitamin E mediated antioxidant activity during HCV infection and may exhibit clinically relevant phenotypes.

Our cohort data showed that, consistent with the in vitro observations, SNP rs757660 did not significantly alter the course of HCV infection in the patients analyzed (Fig. 6).

HDL, LDL and triglyceride levels exhibited non-significant differences, which is in accordance with the in vitro observations regarding cellular cholesterol abundance.

Furthermore, liver inflammation markers and hematology also showed non-significant differences which suggest an equivalent course of infection.

Finally, viral load values exhibited consistent values in all GTs.

These data show that for GT1 isolates, SEC14L2 rs757660 exhibits similar function to the wild-type protein where the virus is concerned.

These results provide an interesting framework when tackling SEC14L2 as a host factor.

On the one side the most prevalent SNP is undistinguishable from the wild-type protein for the viral function, on the other hand we report on a second polymorphism, rs191341134 that maintains the protein ability to enable viral replication in vitro yet results in a significant decrease in replication, which suggests it may be an interesting target for further research.

PARAGRAPH

Taken together, we have shown in this study that homogenous expression of SEC14L2 in hepatoma cell lines is a reliable model for the study of HCV patient isolates, but some limitations must be taken into consideration where storage conditions and GT are concerned.

Furthermore, we have identified an SNP that results in reduced protein expression and HCV replication in vitro.

Finally, we have shown that it is unlikely that rs757660 alters the course of HCV infection in vivo by providing in vitro and in vivo data that demonstrates that this polymorphism is phenotypically equivalent to the wild-type where the virus is concerned.
