TITLE

Effects of the gut–liver axis on ischaemia-mediated hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence in the mouse liver

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide (www.who.int).

Although surgical treatments, including liver resection and liver transplantation, are the best options for patients with curable HCC, cancer recurrence remains the main limitation to these strategies.1,2

In addition to tumor biology, which is the main driving factor for HCC recurrence, preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that organ damage, such as ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, favors the recurrence of HCC and colorectal metastases after liver surgery.3,4

In this regard, experimental studies have demonstrated that liver I/R injury leads to sinusoidal microthrombi, neutrophil sequestration, and the release of proinflammatory and proregenerative molecules5 in the liver, facilitating the entrapment and proliferation of circulating cancer cells in the injured liver.

PARAGRAPH

Liver I/R injury is commonly interpreted as a state of sterile inflammation, where liver tissue undergoing hypoxia initiates a cascade of events that eventually result in hepatocellular injury, alteration of liver function, and worsened oncological outcomes in the presence of cancer.6

However, in addition to the downstream effects of liver blood inflow interruption, portal vein inflow obstruction also causes mesenteric congestion, bowel wall oedema, and venous ischemia, which can facilitate the passage of bacteria (or bacterial debris) from the intestinal lumen to the portal circulation, a process termed ‘bacterial translocation’.7

Translocation of bacterial components in the portal circulation triggers inflammatory pathways and contributes to liver injury through the engagement of various pattern-recognizing receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4).8

Tlr4 binding of circulating Gram-negative bacterial wall lipopolysaccharide (LPS, also known as endotoxin) leads to a cascade of the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling, and upregulation of various inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules.9

Tlr4 is considered to be pivotal to liver I/R, given that it is engaged at the onset of I/R injury and that it induces the release (or the upregulation) of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as heat shock proteins and high-mobility group box protein 1, which are themselves ligands of Tlr4 (or facilitate Tlr4 signaling).10,11

Tlr4 regulates a range of biological responses that reach beyond defence against invading pathogens, including the promotion of inflammation and carcinogenesis.12

PARAGRAPH

Using a mouse model mimicking the recurrence of HCC after liver surgery, we investigated the hypothesis that portal triad clamping induces upstream bowel wall injury, bacterial translocation, and Tlr4-mediated promotion of cancer recurrence.

Moreover, we investigated the efficacy and mechanism of action of remote ischemic preconditioning as a therapeutic approach to mitigate these effects and HCC recurrence.

Materials and methods

SECTION

Animals and surgical procedures

PARAGRAPH

All experiments were performed under a research protocol approved by the ethical committee of the University of Geneva and by the Geneva veterinary authorities (GE/33/15), and in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines.

Surgical procedures were carried out between 09.00 h and 13.00 h. Male C57BL/6j mice (8–10 weeks old) were purchased from Janvier (Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France) and housed in standard, open cages, with an enriched environment (Aspen Tapvei, Harjumaa, Estonia), under 12/12-h light/dark cycles, with free access to water and standard chow (RM3 diet by Special Diet Services, Essex, UK).

After surgery, animals were kept in individually ventilated cages, with the same access to enrichment, water, and food.

Tlr4-deficient mice (C57Bl6/10ScN, herein referred to as Tlr4−/− mice) carry a spontaneous mutation corresponding to a 74,723-bp deletion that completely removes the Tlr4 coding sequence.

No mRNA or protein is expressed and mice have a defective response to LPS stimulation.13

PARAGRAPH

Surgery was performed under inhaled isoflurane anaesthesia.

The abdomen was shaved, a mid-line laparotomy was performed, and the hepatic pedicle was exposed.

To induce liver I/R injury, we occluded 70% of the liver blood inflow for 60 min using a microclamp.

RIPC was achieved by performing six courses of 4 min of ischemia and 4 min of reperfusion by clamping the left femoral vascular bundle (preconditioning), before the sustained 60-min-long liver ischemia.14

The sham condition comprised surgical procedures of identical duration, with vascular structures exposed and mobilized without being occluded.

After liver ischemia, mice were injected intraportally with 1.2 × 105 RIL-175luc HCC cells (kindly provided by Professor T. Greten, NIH).

RIL-175 cells were isolated from hepatic tumors established in C57BL/6 mice by transfer of p53−/− foetal hepatoblasts, transduced with H-RasV12 as previously described.15

At the end of the procedure, the abdominal wall was closed with running monofilament sutures, and the animals were allowed to recover over a heating pad, with subcutaneous buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) and paracetamol dissolved in drinking water.

HCC recurrence after liver resection can arise from either de novo hepatocarcinogenesis or the proliferation of undetected pre-established microtumors.

Therefore, for some experiments, we used a model of pre-established micrometastases, involving the injection of cancer cells into the portal system five days before I/R (or RIPC before ischemia).

SECTION

Assessment of tumor burden

PARAGRAPH

Three weeks after injecting HCC cells, animals were anesthetized, and weighed.

First, tumor burden was quantified in vivo by injecting D-luciferin (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA), and measuring the intensity of the luminescence signal emitted by HCC tissue in an intravital imaging system (IVIS)-200 detector (Xenogen, Alameda, CA, USA).

Next, a midline laparotomy was performed, the liver was harvested and weighed, and we calculated the liver:body weight ratio (LBWR).

Mouse livers with visible tumor nodules were paraffin-embedded, cut, mounted, and stained with hematoxylin/eosin (H&E).

IVIS luminescence signal and LBWR were chosen as measures of tumor burden based on preliminary experiments where we demonstrated that these endpoints were significantly correlated with several histological outcomes, such as the number of nodules per field and the size of the biggest nodule (regression analysis, Figs. S1a–d).

SECTION

Blood chemistry analysis and endotoxin detection

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular injury was determined by measuring blood levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT and AST) with an automated Synchron LX20 (Beckman Coulter, Fulerton, CA, USA).

To assess gut injury, we measured portal blood levels of two markers of intestinal mucosal damage: intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (i-FABP, also known as FABP4) and diamine oxidase (DAO).

Both i-FABP and DAO were measured with ELISA kits, as per the manufacturer’s instructions (LifeSpan Biosciences, Seattle, Washington, USA).

Circulating levels of endotoxin was determined by using the Limulus amoebocyte lysate chromogenic quantitative test QCL-1000™ (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, US).

Briefly, portal blood was harvested and serum was obtained by 7 min centrifugation at 8,000 rpm.

Serum was diluted 1:15, and heated at 75 °C for 15 min before proceeding with the assay, as recommended by the manufacturer.

All procedures were performed using instruments, tubes, and microwell plates that had undergone autoclave sterilization before use.

SECTION

Real-time polymerase chain reaction

PARAGRAPH

After total RNA (cells or liver tissue) extraction, one µg of cDNA was synthesized by extending a mix of random primers with the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit in the presence of RNAase Inhibitor (Applied Biosystems).

The relative quantity of each transcript was normalized to the expression of ribosomal protein large P1 (Rplp1).

Amplification were carried out in a total volume of 20 µl using a thermocycler sequence detector (BioRad CFX96) with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) Core kit for SYBR Green I (Eurogentec).

Primer sequences used in the present study are available upon request from the authors.

SECTION

DNA extraction from fecal samples

PARAGRAPH

From each mouse, two fecal pellets (66–112 mg) were mixed with 100 µl Tris-HCl pH8 10 mM and homogenized with Kimble BioMasherII closed system Micro Tissue Homogenizer (Fisher Scientific, Reinach, Switzerland) for 5 s.

An additional 500 µl Tris-HCl pH8 10 mM was added to the sample and the homogenization was repeated.

The homogenate was transferred, together with 100 µl Tris-HCl pH8 10 mM used to rinse the homogenizer tube, to a NucleoSpin Bead Tube containing ceramic beads (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany).

The NucleoSpin Bead Tube was shaken for 20 min at maximum speed on a Vortex-Genie 2 with a horizontal tube holder (Scientific Industries, Bohemia, NY, USA) and then centrifuged for 1 min at 11,000 g.

A 100-µl aliquot of the supernatant was mixed with 300 µl GT buffer (RBC Bioscience, New Taipei City, Taiwan) and loaded onto a MagCore HF16 automated nucleic acid extractor (RBC Bioscience).

DNA was extracted using the MagCore Genomic DNA Tissue Kit and eluted in 100 µl Tris-HCl pH8 10 mM.

Purified DNA was stored at −20 °C.

SECTION

Determination of fecal bacterial load by qPCR

PARAGRAPH

Bacterial loads in the fecal samples were assessed by using qPCR targeting the V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Escherichia coli positions 338–534), as described previously.16

The reference curve for DNA quantitation was created by using known concentrations of E. coli DH5alpha genomic DNA.

The E. coli DH5alpha genome weighs approximately 4.69 fg and contains seven 16S rDNA copies.

SECTION

Modulation of Tlr4 signaling

PARAGRAPH

Tlr4 signaling was dampened or enhanced in vivo by using several approaches.

Some mice were gut-sterilized using a well-established combination of ampicillin (1 g/L), neomycin (1 g/L), metronidazole (1 g/L) and vancomycin (500 mg/L) in drinking water beginning two weeks before surgery and liver ischemia, and continued until the end of follow-up.

This cocktail has been shown to substantially reduce circulating endotoxin levels.17

For Tlr4 inhibition, mice were administered with CyP, a cyanobacterial LPS-like Tlr4 competitive inhibitor, via intraperitoneal pumps (Alzet model 2004) at a dose of 15 mg/kg/week.

In-depth CyP characterization has been published elsewhere.18,19

CyP treatment started 24 h before liver surgery and lasted for two weeks.

We also used another Tlr4 inhibitor, CLI-095 (also known as TAK-242; Invivogen, Toulouse, France).

CLI-095 is a cyclohexene derivative that specifically suppresses the Tlr4 response by blocking the signaling mediated by the intracellular domain of Tlr4.20,21

Mice received 1 mg/kg of CLI-095 at the time of ischemia and thereafter a daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection throughout the follow-up.

PARAGRAPH

Tlr4 agonism was achieved by a continuous injection of LPS via subcutaneous pumps (Alzet, model 2002) at a dose of 300 μg/kg/day, beginning one day before surgery, as previously described.22

For some experiments, to mimic the hypothesized Tlr4 signaling provoked by liver ischemia, mice received a 2 mg/kg bolus of LPS, administered i.p. at the time of cancer cell injection.

Statistical analyses

PARAGRAPH

Statistical analyses were performed using the software Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).

Non-parametric tests were used whenever N <7.

Results

SECTION

Remote ischemic preconditioning prevents liver injury by dampening small bowel venous ischemia and preventing bacterial translocation

PARAGRAPH

Initially, we assessed whether intestine venous ischemia resulting from mesenteric venous outflow obstruction could contribute to the hepatic injury provoked by pedicle clamping.

We also evaluated whether brief and repeated sequences of femoral vascular bundle clamping and declamping (herein referred to as RIPC) could mitigate such injury.

To this end, we clamped, during 60 min, 70% of the liver blood inflow in wild-type C57BL/6j mice and measured blood levels of aminotransferases.

After 60 min of liver pedicle clamping, mice displayed pronounced hepatocellular injury, as assessed by increased blood levels of AST and ALT.

By contrast, when we submitted littermates to RIPC before liver pedicle clamping, the release of aminotransferase was significantly attenuated during the 24 h following ischemia (Fig. 1A,B).

This result was consistent with reduced liver histological damage, because we observed lesions that were less severe in nature in mice receiving RIPC before ischemia compared with those undergoing direct ischemia (Fig. 1C).

Given that liver pedicle clamping provokes mesenteric outflow obstruction, we sought to determine whether intestine venous ischemia contributed, through the reperfusion stage, to liver injury.

We also evaluated whether RIPC was effective at protecting the gut barrier.

Small bowel venous ischemia was assessed by evaluating intestine damage with standard histology and by measuring portal blood levels of i-FABP and DAO, two markers of intestinal mucosal damage.

Compared with sham-operated and remotely preconditioned animals, mice submitted to liver pedicle clamping displayed severe capillary engorgement and intestine villous disruption (Fig. 1D), as well as higher levels of i-FABP and DAO (Fig. 1E–F).

Such alterations of the gut barrier in the ischemic group favored bacterial translocation, as assessed by measuring portal blood levels of endotoxin with a chromogenic quantitative test (Fig. 1G).

These findings indicate that, because of upstream mesenteric venous ischemia, pedicle clamping exposes the liver to harmful gut-derived stimuli, and that RIPC could offer protection in this setting by preventing small bowel injury.

PARAGRAPH

We then tested whether the current observations linking hepatic I/R injury and the gut–liver axis are relevant in the context of HCC recurrence.

In this regard, we used an orthotopic model of liver cancer recurrence, where mice receive an injection of syngeneic HCC cells in the portal vein after undergoing liver pedicle clamping.

Implanted cancer cells were allowed to grow for three weeks before the tumor burden was evaluated by quantification of the luminescent signal emitted by tumor nodules, and by the measurement of the LBWR.

PARAGRAPH

We verified whether increasing severity of liver I/R injury translated into a more elevated tumor burden.

Consistent with previous evidence,5 whereas sham-operated mice only rarely developed tumor nodules, there were incremental elevations in tumor burden after ischemia of increasing duration, as assessed by IVIS analysis and LBWR (Fig. 2A,B).

By contrast, livers undergoing remote preconditioning before ischemia displayed a significantly lower tumor burden compared with their ischemic counterparts (Fig. 2C,D).

We then repeated this experiment using another model of cancer recurrence, where liver injury was applied on liver tissue carrying pre-established micrometastases (injected five days before pedicle clamping).

Results consistently indicated that protecting mouse livers from ischemic damage by RIPC reduced the severity of HCC recurrence (Fig. S4).

PARAGRAPH

Taken together, these findings suggest that the systemic protection conferred by RIPC would be of use in the setting of oncological liver surgery, and that its mechanism of action is linked, at least in part, to the gut–liver axis.

SECTION

Impact of the gut–liver axis on ischemia-mediated HCC outgrowth

PARAGRAPH

Given our observations that liver pedicle clamping increased gut-barrier permeability, facilitated the translocation of bacterial endotoxin in the portal blood, and fostered liver cancer recurrence, we next sought to address the involvement of Tlr4 in mediating these effects.

To this end, we performed mechanistic experiments in vivo, allocating mice to conditions enhancing or dampening Tlr4 activation, and determined the severity of cancer recurrence across such conditions using our orthotopic HCC model.

PARAGRAPH

Conditions enhancing Tlr4 signaling were as follows: (i) standard liver I/R injury by pedicle clamping; and (ii) systemic LPS treatment (300 μg/kg/day, beginning one day before surgery, and throughout follow-up).

Interventions inhibiting Tlr4 signaling were as follows: (i) Tlr4−/−mice (and/or despite liver pedicle clamping); (ii) the use of an LPS-competitive inhibitor of Tlr4 (CyP) (and/or despite liver pedicle clamping); or (iii) gut sterilization with antibiotics (and/or despite liver pedicle clamping).

PARAGRAPH

Before using the Tlr4 inhibitor CyP in our mouse ischemia model, the efficacy of this compound was tested in vitro to validate its dose-dependent abolition of Tlr4 signaling (Fig. 3A).

Gut sterilization was achieved with a well-established cocktail of oral antibiotics that eliminates commensal bacteria23 and reduces circulating endotoxin levels.17

After two weeks on this wide-spectrum antibiotic cocktail, gut-sterilized mice developed characteristic caecal enlargement (Fig. S2).

Furthermore, to better address the impact of the antibiotic cocktail on the gut microbiome, we used qPCR targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to assess bacterial loads in fecal samples of mice treated (or not) with antibiotics.

Results indicated that DNA extracts of faeces from antibiotic-treated mice contained on average 30 times less bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies than those of untreated mice (Fig. 3B,C).

PARAGRAPH

With regard to hepatocellular damage, consistent with the key role of Tlr4 in mediating liver I/R injury,6,10 global Tlr4 knockout, Tlr4 antagonism (by using CyP), and gut sterilization protected mouse livers from hepatocellular damage, as assessed by blood levels of aminotransferases (Fig. 3D,E).

Next, we submitted the aforementioned mice to our model of ischemia-mediated HCC recurrence.

Results indicated that, whereas conditions enhancing Tlr4 response (such as liver pedicle clamping and LPS treatment) provoked a substantial promotion of HCC recurrence, mice with impaired Tlr4 signaling (i.e. global Tlr4 knockout, gut decontamination, or Tlr4 antagonism) were no longer susceptible to tumor growth exaggeration, as shown by a tumor burden similar to that of sham-operated animals (Fig. 4A,B).

This result was consistent both when using a model studying the implantation of circulating cancer cells and a model studying the outgrowth of pre-established liver micrometastases (Fig. S4).

The use of another pharmacological Tlr4 inhibitor, CLI-095 (which blocks the intracellular domain of Tlr4), similarly conferred protection against exaggerated HCC recurrence (Fig. S5).

The differences in terms of hepatocellular damage and tumor burden observed in our experiments did not appear to be mediated by increased (or decreased) tolerance of the small bowel towards venous ischemia, as shown by the similar levels of circulating i-FABP and DAO among the studied conditions (Fig. 4C,D).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Here, we show for the first time that modulation of liver exposure to gut-derived bacterial products is a critical mechanism mediating HCC recurrence after liver surgery (Fig. 5).

Numerous lines of evidence support the harmful impact of liver ischemia on the risk of liver cancer recurrence.3,4,24,25

Several studies have demonstrated that liver I/R injury upregulates the expression of proinflammatory and proproliferation mediators, and that the mounting of such a regenerative response in the injured liver secondarily enhances the growth of circulating (or pre-established) liver cancer metastases.26–29

Furthermore, in a recent study analysing both human and animal data, Li et al. demonstrated that liver damage, as provoked by small-for-size syndrome, promotes hepatic Tlr4 expression, and results in T regulatory cell recruitment and elevated HCC recurrence after liver transplantation.30

PARAGRAPH

Using the archetypal LPS-Tlr4 response as a surrogate for the gut–liver axis, our results indicated that, upon portal triad occlusion, the impairment of splanchnic outflow provokes enterocyte damage, loss of the gut barrier, and bacterial translocation, thereby contributing to the mechanisms of ischemia-mediated HCC recurrence.

The current preclinical observations mirror clinical data reporting the occurrence of bacterial translocation in two common clinical scenarios incorporating splanchnic outflow obstruction, namely the Pringle manoeuvre during liver resection31,32 and recipient warm ischemia during liver transplantation.33–35

In the current study, we also identified that RIPC confers protection against ischemia-mediated accelerated HCC recurrence, at least in part by alleviating intestinal mucosa damage, thus reducing bacterial translocation.

We previously reported that in situ ischemic preconditioning reduces HCC growth in mouse livers with NASH-like chronic injury.29

Although in situ ischemic preconditioning appears to confer protection to livers with underlying parenchymal abnormalities, serial clamping and declamping of the portal vein has been shown to trigger bacterial translocation via intestinal epithelium injury in the human.7

Given that the hypothesis of the current study was that Tlr4 activation by gut-derived ligands would be sufficient to promote HCC recurrence, we chose a remote ischemic preconditioning model, which could confer systemic protection against incoming danger while conserving splanchnic outflow.

Consistent with our finding that RIPC mitigates IR-induced liver injury at least in part by preventing intestinal damage, a randomized controlled trial comparing RIPC vs. no RIPC during open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair reported improved postoperative intestinal function and reduced intestinal injury markers among patients undergoing RIPC.36

PARAGRAPH

In current practice, liver resection without the Pringle manoeuvre can be performed safely because of improved anaesthesia care and the use of modern parenchymotomy devices.

Therefore, the current observations, which are based on a mouse model of portal triad clamping, could be relevant to day-to-day clinical practice.

In this regard, preventing splanchnic congestion and intestinal damage could be applicable in numerous situations of oncological liver surgery, such as by using temporary portocaval shunting during liver transplantation or by optimizing the position of the bowel during surgery.

In this context, the results of an ongoing randomized trial (NCT02784119), assessing the effect of a temporary portocaval shunt on the outcome of liver transplantation with extended criteria donors, will be of particular interest.

In addition, other manipulations of the gut–liver axis could also be tested clinically, such as the use of antibiotics to decontaminate the bowel and decrease the release of LPS, and the use of Tlr4 antagonists (Fig. 5).

PARAGRAPH

The liver microenvironment contains various cell types of distinct embryological origins, such as hepatocytes, endothelial cells, stellate cells, natural killer cells, Kupffer cells, and dendritic cells.

However, it is unclear which cell type is the main driver of the effect reported herein.

Given our finding of a significantly reduced tumor burden in Tlr4−/− mice, Tlr4 activity on circulating tumor cells cannot mediate this effect.

Evidence gathered by others10,22 suggests that parenchymal liver cells (hepatocytes in particular) constitute a key component of Tlr4-mediated liver injury, rather than being passive responders to the effects of inflammation mounted by other cells.

PARAGRAPH

Although the current experiments provide novel insights into the impact of the gut–liver axis on the development of HCC recurrence, there are some limitations to the study.

Firstly, because our model of HCC recurrence is based on the hepatic implantation of circulating cancer cells (blood-borne metastasis), we cannot determine whether chronic dysbiosis and altered gut permeability contribute to de novo hepatocarcinogenesis.

To this end, and in agreement with the current results, two studies using diethylnitrosamine-induced toxic liver injury have convincingly shown that chronic LPS accumulation leads to aggressive hepatocarcinogenesis, and that manipulation of the gut microbiota might favorably influence the risk of liver cancer.22,37

Another limitation to our study is that the systemic administration of LPS did not lead to an increase in AST and ALT release in our mice, while the blood level of aminotransferase was used throughout our study as a surrogate for liver damage, which we hypothesized to be a pivotal event for exaggerated HCC growth to occur.

Intraperitoneal LPS administration is known to trigger systemic inflammatory changes, but it has often been reported that preliminary sensitization with D-galactosamine is required for exogenous LPS to induce aminotransferase elevation.

Given that D-galactosamine also profoundly increases animal mortality (by up to 2,500-fold),38 we chose not to use it in our model because the mice were intended to survive the intervention before undergoing a prolonged period of tumor growth.

Finally, although the observed systemic protection conferred by RIPC implies that mediators carrying this effect must reach distant tissue, we did not aim to identify such mediators in the current study.

In this regard, Oberkofler et al.39 demonstrated that RIPC induces the release of platelet-derived serotonin, eventually resulting in VEGF-mediated liver protection.

PARAGRAPH

In summary, we report mechanisms whereby remote ischemic preconditioning, gut decontamination (antibiotics), and pharmacological Tlr4 inhibition confer systemic protection against ischemia-mediated accelerated HCC growth.

Our results indicate that modulating the gut–liver axis during liver surgery could be a potential target in combating HCC recurrence, especially in the presence of liver parenchymal abnormalities.
