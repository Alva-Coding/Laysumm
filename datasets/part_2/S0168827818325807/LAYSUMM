TITLE

Sorafenib with or without concurrent transarterial chemoembolization in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: The phase III STAH trial

PARAGRAPH

For patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma requiring sorafenib therapy, co-administration with conventional transarterial chemoembolization did not improve overall survival compared to sorafenib alone.

Therefore, sorafenib alone remains the first-line standard of care for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
