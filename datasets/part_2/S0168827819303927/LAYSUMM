TITLE

O-GlcNAcylation-dependent upregulation of HO1 triggers ammonia-induced oxidative stress and senescence in hepatic encephalopathy

PARAGRAPH

Patients with liver cirrhosis frequently exhibit hyperammonemia and suffer from cognitive and motoric dysfunctions, which at least in part involve premature ageing of the astrocytes in the brain.

This study identifies glucosamine and an O-GlcNAcylation-dependent disruption of iron homeostasis as novel triggers of oxidative stress, thereby mediating ammonia toxicity in the brain.
