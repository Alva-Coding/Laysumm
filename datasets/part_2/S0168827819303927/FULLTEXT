TITLE

O-GlcNAcylation-dependent upregulation of HO1 triggers ammonia-induced oxidative stress and senescence in hepatic encephalopathy

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Ammonia is a major toxin in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE).1

In the brain, ammonia is detoxified by glutamine synthetase (GS) in astrocytes and glutamine accumulation in astrocytes in patients with liver cirrhosis and HE triggers the development of a low grade cerebral edema2 associated with oxidative/nitrosative stress.3,4

PARAGRAPH

Several in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that ammonia induces the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in astrocytes,1 which triggers a variety of functional consequences, such as gene expression changes, protein tyrosine nitration, RNA oxidation and senescence.1,5,6

Of note, these functional consequences were also identified in post-mortem brain samples from patients with liver cirrhosis and HE, but not in those without HE.3,4,6

Of particular interest, RNA oxidation was suggested to disturb postsynaptic protein synthesis which is required for memory formation in HE.5

Astrocyte senescence was proposed to destabilize synaptic connections, thereby explaining the clinical observation that cognitive impairment in patients with liver cirrhosis can persist after resolution of an acute episode of overt HE.6,7

In line with this, a recent study showed that astrocyte senescence initiates and promotes cognitive decline in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.8

Overall, this evidence strongly supports an important role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of HE, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood.

PARAGRAPH

Oxidative stress in ammonia-exposed astrocytes and in brains from animal models of HE, or patients with liver cirrhosis and HE, is associated with an upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO1).3,9

While HO1 was shown to protect from oxidative stress in some brain pathologies such as traumatic brain injury,10 its role in the pathogenesis of HE remains unclear.

Likewise, the mechanisms underlying upregulation of HO1 by ammonia are only incompletely understood but may involve downregulation of HO1-targeting microRNAs.11

Upregulation of HO1 may also be triggered by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress12 but whether upregulation of HO1 by ammonia in astrocytes is a consequence of ER stress is not known.

PARAGRAPH

Another functional consequence in ammonia-exposed astrocytes is the glutamine synthesis-dependent O-GlcNAcylation of individual proteins.13

This post-translational modification depends on the synthesis of activated sugar nucleotides within the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and the conversion of glutamine and fructose-6-phosphate to glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P) by GFAT1/2 is rate-controlling.

Similar to phosphorylation, O-GlcNAcylation can modulate the function of many proteins in specific ways.14

Unfortunately, the functional consequences of the ammonia-induced protein O-GlcNAcylation in astrocytes remained completely unknown.13

PARAGRAPH

The aim of the present study was to analyze the mechanisms underlying the ammonia-induced upregulation of HO1 and its role in astrocytes.

Here we identified the O-GlcNAcylation-dependent upregulation of HO1 and Nox4 as a novel mechanism that triggers ammonia-induced RNA oxidation and senescence in astrocytes.

Results

SECTION

Expression levels of HO1 and iron-related genes in post-mortem brain samples from patients with liver cirrhosis with or without HE

PARAGRAPH

Gene expression levels were analyzed by microarray in post-mortem brain tissue from 2 independent patient cohorts.

As shown in Fig. 1, mRNA levels of HO1 were significantly higher in parallel with multiple expression changes of genes related to iron metabolism in post-mortem brain tissue from patients with liver cirrhosis and HE in a European (Fig. 1A) and an Australian (Fig. 1B) cohort.

Importantly, mRNA levels of heavy and light subunits of ferritin were elevated in patients with liver cirrhosis and HE in both cohorts.

Elevated expression levels of ferritin light chain positively correlated with HO1 mRNA levels in patients with liver cirrhosis and HE (Spearmann’s correlation: Australian cohort: r2 = 0.984, p = 0.016; European cohort: r2 = 0.709, p = 0.049).

Such changes were not observed in post-mortem brain samples from patients with liver cirrhosis without HE (Fig. 1A, B).

PARAGRAPH

These data are indicative for altered iron homeostasis in the brain of patients with liver cirrhosis and HE.

SECTION

Characterization of the ammonia-induced upregulation of HO1 in rat astrocytes in vitro

PARAGRAPH

Time- and concentration-dependent effects of ammonia on HO1 protein and mRNA expression levels were analyzed in astrocytes in vitro.

As shown in Fig. 2A, HO1 protein levels were elevated in astrocytes exposed to NH4Cl (5 mM) for 24 h and were still increased after 72 h. Exposure of astrocytes to NH4Cl also upregulated HO1 mRNA levels in a concentration-dependent way (Fig. S3A).

HO1 mRNA levels were significantly elevated in astrocytes exposed to 2.5 and 5 mM NH4Cl for 72 h. Exposure of astrocytes to 0.5 and 1 mM NH4Cl transiently elevated HO1 mRNA levels at 24 h, but not at 72 h (Fig. S3A).

Upregulation of HO1 protein (Fig. 2A) and mRNA (Fig. S3B) by NH4Cl (5 mM) was largely abolished after siRNA-mediated knockdown of GS.

Like NH4Cl, also L-Gln (10 mM, 72 h) upregulated HO1 protein (Fig. S3B).

These results suggest that ammonia upregulates HO1 in a glutamine synthesis-dependent way.

PARAGRAPH

As glutamine is a substrate for glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P) synthesis by GFAT1/2, we analyzed levels of GlcN-6-P, GFAT1/2 protein and mRNA in NH4Cl (5 mM)-exposed astrocytes.

GlcN-6-P levels in NH4Cl (5 mM, 48 h)-exposed astrocytes significantly increased to 1.72 ± 0.16-fold of untreated controls (n = 3, Student’s t test, p < 0.05).

Both GFAT isoforms were significantly upregulated at the mRNA and protein level by NH4Cl (5 mM) after 48–72 h (Fig. 2B, Figs. S3A, C).

Already 1 mM NH4Cl transiently raised GFAT1/2 mRNA levels after 24 h (Fig. S3A).

PARAGRAPH

Upregulation of GFAT1/2 mRNA by NH4Cl (5 mM) was prevented by knockdown or inhibition of GS using siRNA or MSO (3 mM), respectively (Fig. S3C).

siRNA-mediated knockdown of GFAT1/2 significantly decreased HO1 protein (Fig. 2B) and mRNA (Fig. S3B) levels in untreated astrocytes and prevented the NH4Cl (5 mM)-induced upregulation of HO1.

PARAGRAPH

GlcN (8 mM, 72 h), which is intracellularly converted to GlcN-6-P by the low-affinity hexokinase glucokinase (Km = 8 mM),16 strongly upregulated HO1 mRNA and protein in astrocytes (Figs. S3B, D).

While NH4Cl (5 mM) and GlcN (8 mM) elevated HO1 protein to similar extend, HO1 levels in astrocytes exposed to NH4Cl + GlcN were not significantly higher when compared to astrocytes exposed to NH4Cl or GlcN only (Fig. S3B).

PARAGRAPH

These findings indicate that ammonia elevates HO1 protein and mRNA through glutamine synthesis-dependent upregulation of GFAT1/2 and synthesis of GlcN-6-P.

PARAGRAPH

HO1 induction by ammonia is blocked by taurine via an unknown mechanism.11

We therefore investigated the effects of taurine on the NH4Cl-induced upregulation of GFAT1/2.

As shown in Figs. S3B, C, taurine (5 mM) prevented both, the ammonia-induced upregulation of HO1 as well as of GFAT1/2 mRNA.

SECTION

Role of endoplasmic reticulum stress for ammonia-induced upregulation of HO1 in rat astrocytes in vitro

PARAGRAPH

Upregulation of HO1 has been suggested as a consequence of the unfolded protein response which is triggered by ER stress.12

Whether upregulation of HO1 is the cause or a consequence of ammonia-induced ER stress in astrocytes was investigated by analyzing grp78 protein and mRNA levels by Western blot and qPCR, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

NH4Cl (5 mM) significantly upregulated grp78 protein after 48 and 72 h and grp78 mRNA after 72 h (Fig. 2C; Fig. S3E).

Already 1 mM NH4Cl transiently elevated grp78 mRNA levels in astrocytes after 24 h (Fig. S3A).

Knockdown of GS, GFAT1/2 or HO1 by siRNA strongly inhibited the NH4Cl (5 mM)-induced upregulation of grp78 protein and mRNA (Fig. 2C; Fig. S3E).

PARAGRAPH

Since taurine prevented the ammonia-induced upregulation of HO1 mRNA (Fig. S3B) we investigated effects of taurine on grp78 mRNA levels in NH4Cl-exposed astrocytes.

As shown in Fig. S3E, upregulation of grp78 mRNA by NH4Cl (5 mM) in astrocytes was prevented by taurine.

PARAGRAPH

Also GlcN (8 mM, 72 h), which upregulates HO1 in cultured astrocytes, elevated grp78 mRNA (Fig. S3D).

PARAGRAPH

These data suggest that the glutamine and GlcN-6-P synthesis-dependent upregulation of HO1 is not a consequence but rather a trigger of ammonia-induced ER stress in astrocytes.

SECTION

Ammonia inhibits the transcription of the HO1-targeting miR326-3p in an O-GlcNAcylation-dependent way

PARAGRAPH

The glutamine-dependent synthesis of GlcN-6-P by GFAT1/2 determines intracellular levels of activated sugar nucleotides which are utilized by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) for the O-GlcNAcylation of individual proteins.14

As ammonia triggers glutamine synthesis-dependent protein O-GlcNAcylation13 and downregulates the HO1-targeting miR326-3p,11 we investigated a role of GFAT-dependent GlcN-6-P synthesis and protein O-GlcNAcylation for downregulation of miR326-3p in ammonia-exposed astrocytes.

PARAGRAPH

As shown in Fig. 2D, GlcN (8 mM, 72 h) and NH4Cl (5 mM, 72 h) triggered the O-GlcNAcylation of individual proteins in astrocytes and the NH4Cl-induced O-GlcNAcylation was prevented by siRNA-mediated knockdown of OGT.

While distinct proteins were O-GlcNAcylated by GlcN and NH4Cl, others were only O-GlcNAcylated by NH4Cl.

PARAGRAPH

Both, NH4Cl (5 mM) and GlcN (8 mM) also downregulated β-arrestin 1 mRNA and the miR326-3p primary transcript pri-miR326-3p which is co-transcribed with β-arrestin 1, as well as mature miR326-3p (Fig. 2E).

Knockdown of GFAT1/2 or OGT fully prevented the NH4Cl-induced downregulation of pri-miR326-3p and miR326-3p (Fig. 2E).

PARAGRAPH

These data indicate that ammonia inhibits the transcription of the HO1 mRNA-targeting miR326-3p in a way that depends on GlcN-6-P synthesis and protein O-GlcNAcylation.

SECTION

Effects of ammonia on iron homeostasis in cultured rat astrocytes

PARAGRAPH

The effects of ammonia-induced upregulation of HO1 for intracellular iron homeostasis were analyzed by measuring expression of genes and proteins related to iron export and storage.

PARAGRAPH

While mRNA and protein levels of the iron exporter ferroportin (FPN) were significantly elevated, the expression of the FPN accessory factors CP, sCP and hephaestin was downregulated by NH4Cl (5 mM, 72 h; Fig. 3A, B; Table S3).

Similar effects were observed, when astrocytes were exposed to GlcN (8 mM, 72 h; Fig. S4A).

Upregulation of FPN mRNA in NH4Cl-exposed astrocytes was prevented by siRNA-mediated knockdown of GS, GFAT1/2 or HO1 (Fig. 3A).

Furthermore, the effects of NH4Cl on mRNA levels of FPN, CP, sCP, hephaestin and hepcidin were abolished by the GS inhibitors MSO (3 mM) and PPT (100 µM), by the iron chelators PIH (100 µM) and BIP (150 µM) and by taurine (5 mM) (Figs. S4B–D).

While protein levels were significantly increased (Fig. 3B; Table S3), mRNA levels of the endogenous iron chelator ferritin remained unchanged (Fig. 3A) in NH4Cl-exposed astrocytes.

PARAGRAPH

While mRNA and protein levels of FPN were also upregulated by 0.5 mM NH4Cl, CP, hephaestin and ferritin mRNA and protein levels remained unchanged (Figs. S4E, F; Table S3).

However, nuclear ferritin expression significantly increased in astrocytes exposed to 0.5 mM NH4Cl for 72 h to 1.22 ± 0.09-fold of control (Student’s t test, n = 8) (Fig. S4F).

PARAGRAPH

These findings demonstrate that ammonia concentration dependently changed the expression of genes and proteins related to iron homeostasis in astrocytes in a glutamine and GlcN-6-P synthesis, HO1 and iron-dependent way.

PARAGRAPH

Upregulation of FPN and ferritin are known to reflect elevated cytosolic levels of free iron.

In line with this, ferritin immunoreactivity and FPN mRNA were strongly enhanced after induction of an experimental iron overload in astrocytes (Fig. S4G).

PARAGRAPH

We therefore analyzed effects of 0.5 and 5 mM NH4Cl on intracellular levels of free ferrous iron by super-resolution structured illumination microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy using the fluorescent ferrous iron chelators RDA and RhoNox™-1.

RDA fluorescence colocalized with Mitotracker® Green and RhoNox™-1 fluorescence overlapped with LysoTracker™ Green (Fig. 3C, D; Fig. S5A).

Upon chelation of ferrous iron, RDA fluorescence decreases, whereas RhoNox™-1 fluorescence increases.

PARAGRAPH

While RDA fluorescence intensity was reduced, RhoNox™-1 fluorescence was enhanced by NH4Cl in a time and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3C, D; Figs. S5B, C; Table S4).

PARAGRAPH

These findings suggest that ammonia enhances intracellular levels of free ferrous iron in astrocytes.

SECTION

Role of HO1 for ammonia-induced oxidative stress

PARAGRAPH

Ammonia induces RNA oxidation (8OHG) in cultured rat astrocytes in a NADPH oxidase-dependent way.5

RNA is especially vulnerable to oxidation by hydroxyl radical anion which is formed in the so-called Fenton reaction in the presence of ferrous iron and H2O2 and therefore is considered a surrogate marker for oxidative stress.17

As Nox4 is the only Nox isoform which produces H2O2,18 we analyzed effects of ammonia and GlcN on Nox4 expression in astrocytes.

PARAGRAPH

Although NH4Cl (5 mM, 72 h) downregulated Nox4 mRNA, Nox4 protein levels increased as shown by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A).

A strong increase in Nox4 immunoreactivity was already noted in astrocytes exposed to 0.5 mM NH4Cl (Fig. S6).

Also treating the astrocytes with GlcN (8 mM) or inhibiting miR326-3p, which is predicted to target Nox4 mRNA (Table S5), upregulated Nox4 immunoreactivity in the astrocytes (Fig. 4A).

PARAGRAPH

To further analyze whether the ammonia-induced upregulation of HO1 and Nox4 are triggers for ammonia-induced RNA oxidation in the astrocytes, we performed siRNA experiments.

As shown in Fig. 4B, C and Fig. S6, exposure to NH4Cl (0.5 or 5 mM) strongly increased cytosolic 8OH(d)G immunoreactivity in the astrocytes, which is indicative of RNA oxidation (8OHG).

The NH4Cl (5 mM)-induced increase of 8OH(d)G immunoreactivity in astrocytes was completely prevented by siRNA-mediated knockdown of GS, GFAT1/2, HO1, Nox4 or by iron chelation using PIH (100 µM) or BIP (150 µM) (Fig. 4B, C).

PARAGRAPH

These findings demonstrate that ammonia induces RNA oxidation in cultured astrocytes in a glutamine and glucosamine synthesis-dependent way by upregulating HO1, free iron and Nox4-derived H2O2.

SECTION

Role of HO1 and Nox4 for ammonia-induced senescence

PARAGRAPH

The ammonia-induced ROS formation triggers senescence in astrocytes by activating the p53-dependent transcription of the cell cycle inhibitory genes p21 and GADD45α.6

We therefore investigated, whether upregulation of HO1 and Nox4 activates p53 and elevates p21 and GADD45α mRNA levels.

PARAGRAPH

As shown by immunofluorescence analysis in Fig. 5A-C, knockdown of GS, GFAT1/2, HO1 or Nox4 or iron chelation by PIH (100 µM) or BIP (150 µM) inhibited serine392-phosphorylation of p53 and nuclear accumulation of p53 and p21 in NH4Cl (5 mM, 72 h)-exposed astrocytes.

Serine392 phosphorylation of p53 and nuclear accumulation of serine392-phosphorylated p53 and p21 were also observed in Fe(II)Cl2 (25 µM, 18 h)-exposed astrocytes (Fig. S7).

Upregulation of GADD45α mRNA by NH4Cl was significantly inhibited after knockdown of GS, GFAT1/2, HO1 or Nox4 (Fig. 5C).

GS inhibition by MSO (3 mM) or PPT (100 µM) or iron chelation using PIH (100 µM) or BIP (150 µM) prevented upregulation of GADD45α and p21 mRNA in NH4Cl-exposed astrocytes (Fig. S8).

Similar to NH4Cl, also GlcN (8 mM, 72 h) and Fe(II)Cl2 but not the carbon monoxide (CO) donor CORM-A1 (25 µM) or biliverdin (1 µM) upregulated GADD45α and p21 mRNA levels in astrocytes (Fig. 5E).

PARAGRAPH

The effects of the NH4Cl-induced upregulation of p21 and GADD45α on astrocyte proliferation were measured by fluorimetric quantification of DNA content.

In line with earlier findings,6 astrocyte proliferation was significantly inhibited by NH4Cl (5 mM) and this effect was fully prevented by knockdown of GS, GFAT1/2, HO1 or Nox4, iron chelation by PIH (100 µM) or BIP (150 µM) or HO1 inhibition by SnPP (10 µM) (Fig. 5D).

PARAGRAPH

Also exposure of astrocytes to GlcN (8 mM, 120 h), Fe(II)Cl2 (25 µM, 18 h) or to hemin (1 and 5 µM, 72 h) inhibited astrocyte proliferation.

Importantly, the hemin-induced proliferation inhibition was prevented by the iron chelator PIH (100 µM) indicating that the release of ferrous iron from heme inhibits astrocyte proliferation (Fig. 5F).

PARAGRAPH

The data suggest that ammonia inhibits astrocyte proliferation through p53-dependent transcription of the cell cycle inhibitory factors p21 and GADD45α and nuclear accumulation of p21.

This pathway becomes activated by ammonia in a way that depends on glutamine and GlcN-6-P synthesis, HO1-dependent release of ferrous iron and Nox4-derived H2O2.

SECTION

Expression levels of grp78 and O-GlcNAcylated proteins in post-mortem brain samples from patients with liver cirrhosis with and without HE

PARAGRAPH

A potential relevance of ammonia-induced ER stress and O-GlcNAcylation for the pathogenesis of HE was investigated in post-mortem brain samples from patients with liver cirrhosis with and without HE by western blot analysis.

PARAGRAPH

As shown in Fig. 6A, protein levels of the ER stress marker grp78 tended to be increased in brain tissue from patients with liver cirrhosis without HE (p = 0.13), but were significantly (p <0.05) upregulated in patients with liver cirrhosis and HE.

PARAGRAPH

The analysis of O-GlcNAcylated proteins by western blot revealed 4 major proteins, which were prominently anti-O-GlcNAc-immunoreactive in brains from patients with liver cirrhosis and HE (Fig. 6B).

Besides these, further anti-O-GlcNAc-immunoreactive proteins with lower intensity were detected (I in Fig. 6B).

Out of the 4 major anti-O-GlcNAc-immunoreactive proteins, 2 were significantly higher O-GlcNAcylated in post-mortem brain tissue of patients with liver cirrhosis and HE, but not in those without HE (II and V in Fig. 6B).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The present study suggests an important and previously unrecognized role of O-GlcNAcylation-dependent upregulation of HO1 and ferrous iron release for induction of oxidative stress in HE.

PARAGRAPH

In line with this, HO1 mRNA levels and multiple genes involved in iron homeostasis were elevated in post-mortem brain tissue from patients with liver cirrhosis and HE from 2 independent patient cohorts.

Of particular importance, ferritin mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in patients with liver cirrhosis and HE in both cohorts (Fig. 1A, B) and a strong correlation between expression levels of ferritin and HO1 mRNA was found in both cohorts.

Since expression levels of ferritin reflect cytosolic levels of free iron in astrocytes,19 these data are indicative of elevated levels of free iron in brain of patients with liver cirrhosis and HE.

PARAGRAPH

The mechanisms underlying the ammonia-induced upregulation of HO1 and its functional consequences for oxidative stress and senescence were further analyzed in cultured astrocytes.

Our data show that treating the astrocytes with glutamine upregulates HO1 and that siRNA-mediated knockdown of GS fully abolished the ammonia-induced upregulation of HO1 (Fig. 2A, Fig. S3B).

Moreover, the ammonia-induced synthesis of glutamine elevated HO1 protein and mRNA by upregulating GFAT1/2 and consequently the synthesis of GlcN-6-P.

In line with a role of glucosamine for the upregulation of HO1, both, ammonia as well as GlcN increased HO1 protein and mRNA (Fig. 2A; Figs. S3A, B).

Interestingly, lower ammonia concentrations upregulated GFAT2, grp78 and HO1 mRNAs transiently.

This may relate to the activation of counter-regulatory mechanisms which either terminate the de novo synthesis or which enhance the degradation of the respective mRNAs.

PARAGRAPH

Upregulation of HO1 in neurological disorders was demonstrated to be a consequence of ER stress and HO1-derived CO was even suggested to ameliorate ER stress.12

Unexpectedly, we found that upregulation of HO1 is not a consequence but a trigger of ER stress in ammonia-exposed astrocytes (Fig. 2C, Fig. S3E).

The underlying mechanisms are currently unclear, but since HO1 resides at the outer ER membrane, ferrous iron release may trigger oxidative stress close to the ER membrane, thereby disturbing protein synthesis.

PARAGRAPH

In search of the mechanism by which enhanced synthesis of GlcN-6-P upregulates HO1 mRNA and protein in ammonia-exposed astrocytes (Fig. 2A, Fig. S3B), we found that elevating intracellular GlcN-6-P levels either by exposure to GlcN or NH4Cl markedly enhanced the O-GlcNAcylation of specific proteins.

Knockdown of OGT inhibited both, the ammonia-induced O-GlcNAcylation of individual proteins (Fig. 2D) as well as the transcriptional inhibition of pri-miR326-3p which is under β-arrestin 1 promoter control (Fig. 2E).

Thus, downregulation of the HO1-targeting miR326-3p by ammonia was due to a GlcN-6-P synthesis and protein O-GlcNAcylation-mediated inhibition of the transcription of pri-miR326-3p (Fig. 2E).

Unfortunately, the precise mechanism by which O-GlcNAcylation represses the transcription of pri-miR326-3p remains unclear.

A likely explanation could be that transcription factors recruit OGT to the β-arrestin 1 promoter, where OGT inhibits the initiation of transcription through O-GlcNAcylation of RNA polymerase II.20,21

This mechanism was recently identified to underlie the inhibition of nuclear factor κB (NFκB)-dependent proinflammatory gene transcription by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR).21

However, whether GR recruits OGT to the β-arrestin 1 promoter in ammonia-exposed astrocytes needs to be determined.

PARAGRAPH

Upregulation of HO1 by ammonia or GlcN was associated with expression changes of proteins and/or genes reflecting elevated intracellular free iron levels, such as upregulation of the iron exporter FPN and the iron chelator ferritin (Fig. 3A, B; Table S3; Fig. S4A).

Interestingly, ammonia also triggered a nuclear accumulation of ferritin in astrocytes (Fig. S4F) which may be triggered by O-glycosylation22 and which may protect DNA from oxidative damage.23

This may explain why ammonia triggers oxidation of RNA, but not of DNA in astrocytes.5

PARAGRAPH

Importantly, our data indicate that HO1 activity substantially affects iron homeostasis in ammonia-exposed astrocytes.

This is evidenced by the observations that knockdown of GS, GFAT1/2 and HO1 fully prevented the upregulation of FPN mRNA by ammonia (Fig. 3A).

Upregulation of FPN may be easily explained by iron-dependent activation of the metal-responsive transcription factor (MTF) 1 in ammonia-exposed astrocytes.24,25

In line with this, exposure of astrocytes to Fe(II)Cl2 upregulated FPN mRNA levels (Fig. S4G).

Elevated FPN protein levels in ammonia-exposed astrocytes (Fig. 3B; Table S3) may also reflect diminished degradation of FPN by hepcidin (Fig. S4D).

Interestingly, upregulation of FPN and ferritin was accompanied by downregulation of CP and hephaestin mRNA and protein (Fig. 3A, B; Table S3).

As FPN activity relies on physical association with CP26 or hephaestin, our data may indicate that ammonia could impair the export of iron from the astrocytes.

This assumption is further supported by our findings showing that free ferrous iron levels were markedly enhanced in mitochondria and lysosomes in ammonia-exposed astrocytes (Fig. 3C, D) which may relate to ammonia-induced autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction27 and mitophagy.28

While autophagy releases iron ions from ferritin,29 mitophagy may elevate cytosolic heme levels.30

PARAGRAPH

A functional consequence of elevated cytosolic free iron levels in the presence of H2O2 is the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radical anions in the so-called Fenton reaction, which may contribute to ammonia-induced oxidative stress in astrocytes.

As one potential source for H2O2 we identified Nox4, which is upregulated by ammonia via a post-transcriptional mechanism (Fig. 4A) most likely through downregulation of Nox4-targeting (Table S5) miR326-3p (Fig. 2E, 4A).

PARAGRAPH

Most importantly, all maneuvers preventing either upregulation of HO1 or Nox4 such as knockdown of GS, GFAT1/2, HO1 and Nox4 as well as chelation of free iron prevented the ammonia-induced RNA oxidation (Fig. 4B, C).

These findings clearly demonstrate an important role of both, HO1-derived ferrous iron and Nox4-derived H2O2 for the induction of oxidative stress in ammonia-exposed astrocytes.

PARAGRAPH

Our study further identified the ammonia-induced upregulation of HO1 and Nox4 as the mechanism underlying the induction of astrocyte senescence.6

This is evidenced by the findings that the ammonia-induced activation of p53 (Fig. 5A, C), upregulation and nuclear accumulation of p21 (Fig. 5B, C), enhanced transcription of GADD45α (Fig. 5C) and inhibition of proliferation (Fig. 5D) are prevented by knockdown of GS, GFAT1/2, HO1 and Nox4 or iron chelation.

In line with this, incubation of astrocytes with GlcN or ferrous iron upregulated GADD45α and p21 mRNA levels and inhibited astrocyte proliferation.

Importantly, astrocyte proliferation was also inhibited by hemin in an iron-dependent way (Fig. 5E, F).

PARAGRAPH

Another novel finding of the present study is that taurine blocks ammonia-induced ER stress by inhibiting the ammonia-induced upregulation of GFAT1/2 and HO1 (Figs. S3B, C, E).

In line with this, taurine depletion in brains from taurine transporter (TauT) knockout mice is associated with upregulation of HO1 and senescence biomarkers11 and high levels of free iron ions (Fig. S9A).

Cerebral iron levels were also strongly elevated in aged rats (Fig. S9B).

These data further strengthen a role of iron and taurine deficiency for development of senescence.

PARAGRAPH

Elevated protein levels of the ER stress surrogate marker grp78 were also found in post-mortem brain samples from patients with liver cirrhosis with and without HE (Fig. 6A).

This suggests that besides HO1-derived iron, other factors such as ethanol31 may also contribute to ER stress in the brains of patients with liver cirrhosis.

As ER stress is considered multifactorial, ammonia and ethanol may have additive effects on the expression of grp78.

PARAGRAPH

The relevance of our findings for the pathogenesis of HE in humans is further strengthened by our data showing enhanced O-GlcNAcylation in post-mortem brain samples from patients with liver cirrhosis and HE, but not in those without HE (Fig. 6B).

We cannot rule out an impact of confounding factors on the results obtained from human post-mortem brain samples.

However, due to the similar gene expression changes observed in the 2 independent patient cohorts, we are confident in the observed effects.

PARAGRAPH

The findings of our study are at variance with protective effects of HO1 in neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, which may be attributed to the anti-oxidative actions of biliverdin and bilirubin.32

The findings of our study suggest that an insufficient sequestration of ferrous iron by ferritin triggers oxidative stress in ammonia-exposed astrocytes.

In line with this, a sustained transgenic overexpression of HO1 in astrocytes elevates free ferrous iron levels and triggers oxidative stress, mitophagy and senescence.32

PARAGRAPH

It is a limitation of the present study, that the ammonia concentrations used in the in vitro experiments exceed the ammonia levels found in blood of patients with liver cirrhosis and HE (range: 48–343 µmol/L, mean: 146.0 ± 42.6, n = 6).

However, significantly elevated levels of HO1 mRNA and O-GlcNAcylated proteins were observed in post-mortem brain samples from patients with liver cirrhosis and HE, supporting the in vivo relevance of these findings.

However, it remains to be established whether our findings are relevant not only for patients with severe hyperammonemia, but also for those with liver cirrhosis and HE.

SECTION

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

The present study identified the O-GlcNAcylation-dependent upregulation of HO1 and Nox4 as a novel mechanism underlying ammonia-induced RNA oxidation and astrocyte senescence (Fig. 7).

Given the important role of oxidative stress for the pathogenesis of HE, and the inherent limitations of a broad antioxidant therapy, our study warrants further research on the suitability of HO1 or Nox4 inhibitors or iron chelators for the treatment of HE.
