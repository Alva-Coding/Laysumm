TITLE

Platelet-derived growth factor-D enables liver myofibroblasts to promote tumor lymphangiogenesis in cholangiocarcinoma

PARAGRAPH

Cholangiocarcinoma is a highly malignant cancer affecting the biliary tree, which is characterized by a rich stromal reaction involving a dense population of cancer-associated fibroblasts that promote early metastatic spread.

Herein, we show that cholangiocarcinoma-derived PDGF-D stimulates fibroblasts to secrete vascular growth factors.

Thus, targeting fibroblasts or PDGF-D-induced signals may represent an effective tool to block tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis and reduce the invasiveness of cholangiocarcinoma.
