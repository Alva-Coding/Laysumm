TITLE

No impact of resistance-associated substitutions on the efficacy of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and voxilaprevir for 12 weeks in HCV DAA-experienced patients

PARAGRAPH

In phase III studies, 12 weeks of treatment with the combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX) cured 97% of patients with hepatitis C virus who failed prior treatment with direct-acting antiviral drugs.

Herein, we show that the presence of pretreatment drug resistance did not affect treatment outcome in these patients who had previously received direct-acting antivirals.

We also showed that new drug resistance was rare in patients who failed treatment with SOF/VEL/VOX for 12 weeks.

This has important implications for the selection of best retreatment strategies for these patients.
