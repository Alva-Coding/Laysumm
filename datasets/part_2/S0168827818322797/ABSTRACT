ABSTRACT

TITLE

No impact of resistance-associated substitutions on the efficacy of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and voxilaprevir for 12 weeks in HCV DAA-experienced patients

PARAGRAPH

In phase III studies, the fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX) administered for 12 weeks led to a sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12) in 96% of NS5A inhibitor-experienced patients, and an SVR12 rate of 98% in DAA-experienced patients who had not previously received an NS5A inhibitor.

Herein, we evaluate the relationship between the presence of detectable resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) at baseline and treatment outcome, and whether RASs were selected for in cases of virologic failure.

PARAGRAPH

NS3, NS5A, and NS5B deep sequencing analyses were performed at baseline for all patients and at the time of virologic failure.

Results are reported using a 15% cut-off.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 82.7% of NS5A inhibitor-experienced patients (205/248) had baseline NS3 and/or NS5A RASs; 79% had baseline NS5A RASs.

SVR12 rates were similar in patients with or without NS3 and/or NS5A RASs, and with or without VOX- or VEL-specific RASs.

RASs at NS5A position Y93 were present in 37.3% of patients and 95% achieved SVR12.

All patients with â‰¥2 NS5A RASs achieved SVR12.

Baseline NS3 and/or NS5A RASs were present in 46.6% (83/178) of non-NS5A inhibitor DAA-experienced patients, all of whom achieved SVR12.

All patients with baseline NS5B nucleoside inhibitor RASs, including two patients with S282T, achieved SVR12.

Treatment-selected resistance was seen in one of seven patients who relapsed.

PARAGRAPH

Baseline RASs had no impact on virologic response in DAA-experienced patients following treatment with SOF/VEL/VOX for 12 weeks.

Selection of viral resistance with virologic relapse was uncommon.
