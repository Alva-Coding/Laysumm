TITLE

Reassessing the accuracy of PAGE-B-related scores to predict hepatocellular carcinoma development in patients with chronic hepatitis B

PARAGRAPH

Risk scores have been developed to predict the likelihood of patients with chronic hepatitis B developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

We investigated the role of 2 such scores, PAGE-B and modified PAGE-B, in predicting the risk of HCC in 32,150 nucleos(t)ide analogue-treated patients with chronic hepatitis B.

These scores identified a group of patients at very low risk of developing HCC who could therefore be exempted from HCC surveillance.
