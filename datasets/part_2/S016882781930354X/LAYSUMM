TITLE

Intelligent liver function testing (iLFT): A trial of automated diagnosis and staging of liver disease in primary care

PARAGRAPH

There is a growing epidemic of advanced liver disease, this could be offset by early detection and management.

Checking liver blood tests (LFTs) should be an opportunity to diagnose liver problems, but abnormal results are often incompletely investigated.

In this study we were able to substantially increase the diagnostic yield of the abnormal LFTs using the automated intelligent LFT system.

With the addition of referral recommendations and management plans, this strategy provides optimum investigation and management of LFTs and is cost saving to the NHS.
