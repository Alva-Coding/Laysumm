ABSTRACT

TITLE

Impaired brain glymphatic flow in experimental hepatic encephalopathy

PARAGRAPH

Neuronal function is exquisitely sensitive to alterations in the extracellular environment.

In patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE), accumulation of metabolic waste products and noxious substances in the interstitial fluid of the brain is thought to result from liver disease and may contribute to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment.

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the accumulation of these substances, such as bile acids, may result from reduced clearance from the brain.

PARAGRAPH

In a rat model of chronic liver disease with minimal HE (the bile duct ligation [BDL] model), we used emerging dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and mass-spectroscopy techniques to assess the efficacy of the glymphatic system, which facilitates clearance of solutes from the brain.

Immunofluorescence of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and behavioural experiments were also performed.

PARAGRAPH

We identified discrete brain regions (olfactory bulb, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus) of altered glymphatic clearance in BDL rats, which aligned with cognitive/behavioural deficits.

Reduced AQP4 expression was observed in the olfactory bulb and prefrontal cortex in HE, which could contribute to the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the impairment in glymphatic function in BDL rats.

PARAGRAPH

This study provides the first experimental evidence of impaired glymphatic flow in HE, potentially mediated by decreased AQP4 expression in the affected regions.
