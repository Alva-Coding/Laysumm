TITLE

Impaired brain glymphatic flow in experimental hepatic encephalopathy

PARAGRAPH

The ‘glymphatic system’ is a newly discovered brain-wide pathway that facilitates clearance of various substances that accumulate in the brain due to its activity.

This study evaluated whether the function of this system is altered in a model of brain dysfunction that occurs in cirrhosis.

For the first time, we identified that the clearance of substances from the brain in cirrhosis is reduced because this clearance system is defective.

This study proposes a new mechanism of brain dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis and provides new targets for therapy.
