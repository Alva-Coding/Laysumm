TITLE

Generation of expandable human pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like liver organoids

PARAGRAPH

A functionally mature, human cell-based liver model exhibiting human responses in toxicity prediction and drug evaluation is urgently needed for pre-clinical drug development.

Here, we develop a novel human pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like liver organoid that is critically advanced in terms of its generation method, functional performance, and application technologies.

Our organoids can contribute to the better understanding of liver development and regeneration, and provide insights for metabolic studies and disease modeling, as well as toxicity assessments and drug screening for personalized medicine.
