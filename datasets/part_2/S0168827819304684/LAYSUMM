TITLE

Suboptimal SVR rates in African patients with atypical genotype 1 subtypes: Implications for global elimination of hepatitis C

PARAGRAPH

Direct-acting antiviral medications are able to cure hepatitis C in the majority of patients.

The most common genotype of hepatitis C in Europe and the United States is genotype 1a or 1b and most clinical trials focused on these genotypes.

We report that in a group of African patients, most of them had unusual (non-1a/1b) genotype 1 subtypes, and that the cure rate in these unusual genotypes was lower than in genotypes 1a and 1b.
