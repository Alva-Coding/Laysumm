ABSTRACT

TITLE

Suboptimal SVR rates in African patients with atypical genotype 1 subtypes: Implications for global elimination of hepatitis C

PARAGRAPH

HCV subtypes which are unusual in Europe are more prevalent in the African region, but little is known of their response to direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).

These include non-1a/1b/ non-subtypeable genotype 1 (G1) or non-4a/4d (G4).

In this report we aimed to describe the genotype distribution and treatment outcome in a south London cohort of African patients.

PARAGRAPH

We identified all patients born in Africa who attended our clinic from 2010-2018.

Information on HCV genotype, treatment regimen and outcome were obtained.

Non-subtypeable samples were analysed using Glasgow NimbleGen next-generation sequencing (NGS).

Phylogenetic analysis was carried out by generating an uncorrected nucleotide p-distance tree from the complete coding regions of our sequences.

PARAGRAPH

Of 91 African patients, 47 (52%) were infected with an unusual subtype.

Fourteen novel, as yet undesignated subtypes (G1*), were identified by NGS.

Three individuals were infected with the same subtype, now designated as subtype 1p.

Baseline sequences were available for 22 patients; 18/22 (82%) had baseline NS5A resistance-associated substitutions (RASs).

Sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved in 56/63 (89%) overall, yet only in 21/28 (75%) of those with unusual G1 subtypes, with failure in 3/16 G1*, 1/2 G1p and 3/3 in G1l.

Six treatment failures occurred with sofosbuvir/ledipasvir compared to 1 failure on a PI-based regimen.

The SVR rate for all other genotypes and subtypes was 35/35 (100%).

PARAGRAPH

Most individuals in an unselected cohort of African patients were infected with an unusual genotype, including novel subtype 1p.

The SVR rate of those with unusual G1 subtypes was 75%, raising concern about expansion of DAAs across Africa.

Depending on the regimen used, higher failure rates in African cohorts could jeopardise HCV elimination.
