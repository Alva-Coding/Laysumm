TITLE

OGDHL silencing promotes hepatocellular carcinoma by reprogramming glutamine metabolism

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, which has increased morbidity and mortality of patients with liver disorders [1].

Therefore, novel causative molecular biomarkers need to be identified to improve clinical decision-making and therapy.

Cancer cells undergo huge metabolic alterations to compete for nutrient-limited resources with surrounding normal cells in order to maintain rapid growth; therefore; understanding these changes is fundamental for identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in HCC [2].

PARAGRAPH

Glutamine, the most abundant amino acid in blood, has been widely reported as a key source of carbon secondary only to glucose for energy production and anabolic processes [3].

Recently, glutamine was shown to be vital for fueling mitochondrial metabolism to maintain rapid rates of cancer cell growth [4-6].

Inhibiting mitochondrial glutamine metabolism had been found to exert strong anticancer effects [7].

PARAGRAPH

Mitochondrial glutamine metabolism involves either oxidative or reductive metabolic pathways [8].

During mitochondrial utilization of glutamine, α-ketoglutarate (αKG) is produced typically by glutaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase from a two-step conversion of glutamine.

In turn, αKG is either oxidized to succinate by the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHC) in the canonical forward mode of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, or it can undergos reductive carboxylation (RC), thereby pushing the reverse TCA cycle towards citrate for further de novo lipogenesis [9-12].

More recently, it has been shown that reductively metabolized glutamine may become a major carbon source for lipid biosynthesis during impaired mitochondrial function [11-12], and that this switch in carbon source selection was fundamental for sustaining rapid cell proliferation [10, 13].

PARAGRAPH

Tumor cells exhibit severe defects in mitochondrial function induced by silencing or mutations of genes encoding key enzymes involved in the TCA cycle.

These defects have been reported in fumarate hydratase in renal neoplasms and in subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase complex in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma [14-18].

All of these defects hampered both glucose and glutamine oxidative metabolism in the TCA cycle.

Therefore, RC can substitute to support biosynthesis by enabling cells with mitochondrial dysfunction to maintain biosynthetic precursor pools that would normally be provided by oxidative metabolism [19].

In this regard, the identification of alterations in genes encoding key enzymes participating in the TCA cycle has emphasized the importance of mitochondrial metabolic fluxes (such as RC of glutamine-derived αKG) in regulating both the metabolism and function of tumor cells with mitochondrial dysfunction [9].

PARAGRAPH

The function of oxoglutarate dehydrogenase-like (OGDHL), one of the rate-limiting components of the OGDHC, has been reported in certain cancers.

Some studies have previously demonstrated that OGDHL expression was silenced by cancer-specific promoter methylation in lung, breast, cervix, oesophagus, pancreas and colon cancers [20-21].

Inactivation of OGDHL was shown to contribute to cervical tumor proliferation via activation of the AKT signaling pathway [22].

Moreover, OGDHL downregulation resulted in suppression in the activity of the key mitochondrial multi-enzyme OGDHC [23], which was associated with RC of glutamine-derived αKG [24].

However, neither has the role of OGDHL in altered reductive glutamine metabolism been evaluated in HCC, nor has research revealed whether silencing of OGDHL affects survival prognosis in HCC patients.

PARAGRAPH

Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the effects and clinical significance of silenced OGDHL expression in HCC patients.

Our study examined whether OGDHL downregulation was correlated with HCC progression and prognosis by analyzing three large independent cohorts (n=681).

The genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of silenced OGDHL expression were investigated.

Depletion of OGDHL resulted in significantly higher activation of mTORC1 signaling and reductive glutamine metabolism, which was accompanied by glutamine-derived fatty acid biosynthesis.

In addition, the suppression of glutamine metabolism by OGDHL overexpression or through the use of glutaminase inhibitors 968 or bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES) sensitized tumor cells to sorafenib, currently approved for treatment of HCC patients.

Overall, these observations demonstrate for the first time to our knowledge that OGDHL acts as a novel suppressor of HCC and may thus be a suitable target for metabolism-based therapeutic strategies in HCC.

PARAGRAPH

The animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University.

Six-week-old male athymic BALB/C nu/nu mice were randomly divided into groups before inoculation.

Mice were kept in a standard animal laboratory with free access to food and water.

They were housed under constant environmental conditions with a 12-hour dark-light cycle.

All experiments were conducted under aseptic conditions.

For subcutaneous tumor models, 5×106 HCC-LM3 cells with or without ectopic OGDHL expression were resuspended in 100 μl PBS and injected subcutaneously into either flank of the male nude mice.

Tumor volume was tested by a digital caliper and measured using the following formula: tumor volume=length (mm) × width2 (mm) × 0.5.

For chemo-sensitivity tests, tumor-bearing mice were treated with BPTES, sorafenib, both, or vehicle as indicated on day 4 after inoculation with HCC-LM3 cells.

Results

SECTION

OGDHL in the TCA cycle was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues

PARAGRAPH

To identify potential targets with clinical significance for the TCA cycle in human HCC, we tested the expression of TCA cycle enzymes by transcriptome sequencing in 15 pairs of human HCC and normal liver specimens.

Our transcriptome sequencing of 15 HCCs suggested that the expression levels of several genes in the TCA cycle, including IDH2, SDHB, SDHD and OGDHL, were downregulated in our small HCC cohort (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. 1).

In particular, the level of OGDHL was correlated with tumor stage (Supplementary Fig. 1A) and HCC differentiation grade (Supplementary Fig. 1B), which was not the case for the other three downregulated genes.

Therefore, we subsequently confirmed OGDHL downregulation in an expanded cohort of 80 HCC patients by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1B).

Notably, OGDHL downregulation occurred in 28.75% (23/80) of HCC patients by at least 1.5-fold (Fig. 1C).

In order to further demonstrate the clinical significance of OGDHL expression, we examined OGDHL expression in HCC specimens and nontumorous liver tissues among three large independent HCC cohorts (Fig. 1, D-F).

First, we investigated public datasets of HCC samples from The Cancer Gene Atlas (TCGA; Fig. 1D) and from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database under accession number GSE14520 (Fig. 1E).

Consistent with our previous in-house expression data, OGDHL expression in HCC specimens was significantly lower than in nontumorous liver tissues in both TCGA and GSE14520 datasets (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively).

Furthermore, a significant correlation was observed between lower OGDHL expression and advanced TNM stage in the TCGA dataset (stage I vs. stage II, P=0.045; stage I vs. stage III, P=0.01) and in the GSE14520 dataset (stage I vs. stage III, P=0.009).

In addition, OGDHL was downregulated in different HCC subtypes in the TCGA dataset (Supplementary Fig. 2), revealing that downregulation of OGDHL is a common event in HCC.

Next, to further confirm that OGDHL downregulation in HCC tissues was also present at the protein level, IHC on the TMA was performed to measure OGDHL protein levels in primary HCC specimens from 90 postoperative HCC patients who underwent curative hepatic resection at our institution (cohort 2; Fig. 1F and Supplementary Fig. 3 and 4).

Consistent with our data at the mRNA level, OGDHL protein expression in HCC tissues was markedly lower than that in adjacent tissues (P<0.001).

Moreover, OGDHL downregulation was significantly correlated with advanced tumor stage (stage I vs. stage II, P=0.028; stage I vs. stage III, P=0.004).

These results indicated that downregulation of OGDHL may contribute to malignant progression of HCC.

SECTION

Promoter hypermethylation and DNA copy deletion silenced OGDHL expression

PARAGRAPH

To determine the mechanisms silencing OGDHL expression in HCC cases, the promoter methylation status of OGDHL was analyzed using qMSP.

Methylated and unmethylated primers were designed to amplify specific GpC sites in the promoter region of the OGDHL gene after bisulphite treatment of DNA in 80 pairs of primary HCC and paracancerous liver tissues (PCT; Cohort 1; Supplementary Fig. 5A).

Our experimental results suggested an elevated promoter methylation status of OGDHL in HCC cases compared to PCTs (P=0.02; Supplementary Fig. 5B).

Pearson’s analysis also revealed an inverse correlation between methylation and OGDHL expression (R=−0.24, P=0.032; Supplementary Fig. 5C and 5D).

PARAGRAPH

In addition, we screened data from TCGA for promoter methylation and DNA copy changes to reveal the mechanisms inhibiting OGDHL expression in HCC tissues (Fig. 1, G-I).

We reveal that the OGDHL promoter was hypermethylated in tumors compared to nontumorous samples (P<0.001; Fig. 1G).

Moreover, low OGDHL expression was related to high methylation of the OGDHL promoter, as verified by Pearson’s correlation test (R=−0.261, P<0.001; Fig. 1H), suggesting that OGDHL promoter hypermethylation in HCC suppressed the transcriptional activity of OGDHL.

Meanwhile, OGDHL downregulation was significantly correlated with decreased genomic copy number (the average OGDHL level for tumors with copy-number loss was 0.899 relative to that of copy-number diploid/gain; Fig. 1I).

Furthermore, the multivariate regression model was applied to analyze the integrated contribution of both DNA copy number changes and promoter methylation relative to OGDHL expression.

The t values of the coefficient tests for linear regression were -4.873 (P<0.001) and 3.327 (P=0.001), respectively.

The results demonstrated that promoter hypermethylation status and DNA copy deletion were independently correlated with lower OGDHL expression in HCC tissues.

SECTION

The silencing of OGDHL expression in primary HCC is associated with worse clinical outcomes

PARAGRAPH

To further evaluate the clinical significance of OGDHL expression, survival prognosis was analyzed among three large independent HCC cohorts.

On the basis of the OGDHL mRNA expression level, tumor tissues were divided into two groups by the minimum P value approach to identify the optimal risk separation cutoff value in both TCGA and GSE14520 datasets for survival analysis [28].

The cutoff points for high and low OGDHL expression groups were 10.44 (log2 expression) in TCGA and 6.48 (log2 expression) in the GSE14520 dataset.

Downregulation of OGDHL mRNA correlated with poorly differentiated HCC in TCGA (poorly vs. well, P=0.029; poorly vs. moderate, P<0.001; Fig. 2A) and with larger tumor size in the GSE14520 dataset (≤5 cm vs. >5 cm, P=0.025; Fig. 2B).

For the analysis of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that HCC patients with low OGDHL mRNA levels had worse OS (TCGA: median OS, 27.6 months vs. >65 months; log-rank, 12.117; P<0.001; GSE14520: median OS, 44.5 months vs. 53.6 months; log-rank, 5.537; P=0.019) and shorter RFS (GSE14520: median RFS, 30.7 months vs. 51.1 months; log-rank, 4.612; P=0.032) than patients with high OGDHL mRNA levels (Fig. 2, C and D).

Notably, these findings were validated by the analysis of 90 patients in the Zhongshan HCC set (cohort 2) on the basis of the OGDHL protein level.

All of the samples could be classified into high and low OGDHL levels according to IHC staining scores.

IHC analysis showed that the low OGDHL expression group exhibited a poorer tumor differentiation grade (P=0.016) and larger tumor size (P=0.004) than the high OGDHL expression group (Supplementary Table 3).

Meanwhile, HCC patients in the low OGDHL expression group displayed worse OS and shorter RFS than those in the high OGDHL expression group (Fig. 2E).

Alternatively, in the multivariate statistical analyses that removed tumor staging as a confounding factor, Cox’s multivariate proportional hazards model was performed (Supplementary Table 4)，which showed that low OGDHL level was an independent risk predictor of worse OS [Cohort 2: hazard ratio (HR), 2.255; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.193–4.265; P=0.012; TCGA: HR, 2.042; 95% CI, 1.425–2.928; P<0.001] and shortened RFS (Cohort 2: HR, 1.902; 95% CI, 1.126–3.211; P=0.016; GSE14520: HR, 1.537; 95% CI, 1.071–2.206; P=0.02).

Taken together, these results demonstrated that lower OGDHL expression was significantly related with poor survival and higher risk of recurrence in patients with HCC.

SECTION

OGDHL downregulation enhanced tumor proliferation in HCC

PARAGRAPH

In order to investigate whether OGDHL downregulation promoted tumor progression in hepatoma cell lines, we first assessed OGDHL expression by qRT-PCR and western blotting in nine different hepatoma cell lines.

At least seven hepatoma cell lines (77.8%) silenced OGDHL expression compared to normal liver LO2 cells, whereas the protein expression of OGDH was highly conserved in the panel of hepatoma cell lines (Fig. 3, A and B; Supplementary Fig. 6).

To further examine the functional impacts of OGDHL in hepatoma cell progression, we constructed shRNA-OGDHL knockdown clones (sh-A and sh-B) in Bel-7402 and SMMC-7721 cells (Fig. 3, C and D), as well as stable models of OGDHL overexpression in HCC-LM3 and MHCC-97H cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 7, A and B).

Cell viability was initially determined by cell counting kit (CCK)-8 assay.

Consistent with the previous report in cervical tumor cells [22], endogenous knockdown of OGDHL significantly promoted the proliferation of hepatoma cells (Fig. 3, E and F), whereas exogenous overexpression of OGDHL markedly inhibited the proliferation of hepatoma cells in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 8, A and B).

To assess long-term growth, colony focus assays showed that knockdown of OGDHL induced anchorage-independent tumor cell growth by significantly increasing the colony forming ability of hepatoma cells (Fig. 3, G and H), whereas overexpression of OGDHL suppressed colony formation (Supplementary Fig. 8, C and D).

Moreover, stable overexpression of OGDHL markedly reduced the size of xenograft tumors compared to the control group in vivo (Fig. 3I).

Taken together, these data indicated that downregulation of OGDHL had pro-proliferative effects in hepatoma cells.

SECTION

Genetic suppression of OGDHL decreased mitochondrial glucose oxidation by reduction of OGDHC activity in hepatoma cells

PARAGRAPH

OGDHL is one of the pivotal components of the OGDHC [29], and depletion of OGDHL reduced OGDHC activity in the TCA cycle according to previous research [23].

Therefore, we measured OGDHC enzyme activity in hepatoma cells and found an approximately 50% reduction in activity upon OGDHL depletion (Fig. 4A).

Moreover, shRNA-OGDHL knockdown clones (sh-A and sh-B) in Bel-7402 cells suppressed OGDHC activity that was insensitive to carboxyethyl ester of succinyl phosphonate (CESP), a specific inhibitor of OGDHC [30], while OGDHL reintroduction in OGDHL-negative HCC-LM3 cells increased OGDHC activity and reinforced the CESP inhibitory effect (Fig. 4B).

Similar OGDHL-responsive regulation of OGDHC activity was also seen in two additional hepatoma cell lines, SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97H (Supplementary Fig. 9, A and B).

PARAGRAPH

OGDHC is one of the rate-limiting enzymes in the TCA cycle and represents a major modulator of glucose and glutamine oxidation [19], which supplies the two primary nutrients utilized by cancer cells following tumorigenesis to meet biosynthetic requirements [3].

Thus, we further investigated the function of OGDHL on both glucose and glutamine oxidation.

We observed that OGDHL-negative HCC-LM3 cells had a low-level of OGDHC activity that was decreased exclusively by glucose oxidation, but not in glutamine-only media (Fig. 4C).

Reintroduction of OGDHL into these cells increased mitochondrial glucose oxidation.

Increased glucose oxidation in response to OGDHL upregulation was dependent on OGDHC activity as it was attenuated in cells treated with CESP (Fig. 4C).

These experiments thus determined that silencing of OGDHL expression was necessary to inhibit the oxidative use of glucose through OGDHC inhibition.

Next, we analyzed whether OGDHL downregulation was sufficient to reduce glucose oxidation through the use of shRNA knockdown.

Consistently, Fig. 4D showed that OGDHL knockdown decreased glucose oxidation, but not glutamine, and blocked the CESP-dependent reduction in glucose oxidation.

Taken together, these results suggested that OGDHL knockdown in hepatoma cells was sufficient and necessary to exclusively decrease glucose oxidation by reduction of OGDHC activity.

SECTION

Knockdown of OGDHL expression stimulated glutamine consumption and supported the cellular antioxidant system

PARAGRAPH

Recently, many studies have demonstrated that after dysfunctions in mitochondrial key enzymes of the TCA cycle, glutamine was the major alternative to replenish the TCA cycle for bioenergetic requirements [11, 31-32].

Our data previously showed that the suppression of OGDHC activity by OGDHL knockdown did not reduce mitochondrial glutamine oxidation in hepatoma cells.

Therefore, we investigated if glutamine metabolism was vital for fueling mitochondria to maintain biosynthesis in OGDHL-negative hepatoma cells.

Firstly, we tested the effects of OGDHL on glutamine metabolism in hepatoma cells.

Interestingly, glutamine consumption was upregulated while glutamate secretion remained unchanged in OGDHL-downregulated hepatoma cells, revealing that knockdown of OGDHL elevated net glutamine consumption and that the increase in glutamine carbons after OGDHL suppression in hepatoma cells might be used for biosynthesis (Fig. 4, E and F).

To further investigate whether the upregulated consumption of intracellular glutamine affected mitochondrial glutaminolysis separately from cytosolic glutamine function, we assessed the oxidative substrate preference of hepatoma cells using a mitochondrial fuel flex assay.

During this assay, inhibitors were injected in a pre-designed order to measure dependency on glutamine, glucose and fatty acid oxidation by testing the changes in OCR.

The mitochondrial fuel flex assay indicated that glucose dependency was significantly reduced in OGDHL-downregulated hepatoma cells while glutamine dependency was significantly increased (Supplementary Fig. 10, A and B).

Given that glutamine is a precursor for production of GSH and NADPH to support the NADPH-dependent GSH redox system, we measured the NADPH/NADP+ and GSH/GSSG ratios to evaluate the NADPH-dependent GSH redox system in hepatoma cells with different levels of OGDHL expression.

As shown in Figure 4 G-J, the NADPH/NADP+ ratio of knockdown OGDHL clones (sh-A and sh-B) was more than 3-fold higher, and the GSH/GSSG ratio was 9-fold higher, than in Bel-7402 cells (Fig. 4, G and H).

Similar changes were also observed following reintroduction of OGDHL in OGDHL-deficient HCC-LM3 cells (Fig. 4, I and J).

These results suggested that knockdown of OGDHL in hepatoma cells helped to provide an abundant supply of NADPH and GSH to maintain the cellular redox balance and antioxidant system [33].

Taken together, these results further corroborated the hypothesis that knockdown of OGDHL expression shifted mitochondrial fuel utilization to glutamine and supported the cellular antioxidant system in hepatoma cells.

SECTION

Depletion of OGDHL expression induced reductive glutamine metabolism by inhibition of OGDHC activity

PARAGRAPH

Glutamine can contribute carbon by two distinct pathways.

In one pathway, glutamine-derived αKG is metabolized oxidatively in the TCA cycle and produces pyruvate from malate via glutaminolysis [9].

However, some tissues can also reductively carboxylate αKG to synthesize citrate for de novo lipogenesis [34].

To determine which pathway OGDHL-negative cells utilized to incorporate glutamine carbon, we utilized stable isotopic tracers (Fig. 5A).

PARAGRAPH

To reveal the metabolic signature of the engineered cell lines, the contribution of each stable isotopic tracer into TCA cycle metabolites was measured by GC-MS with either [U-13C5] glutamine or [U-13C6] glucose.

As shown in Figure 5B, RC was inhibited by reconstitution of wild-type OGDHL into OGDHL-negative HCC-LM3 cells, whereas the suppression of OGDHC activity by CESP was sufficient to promote RC by restoring the enrichment of M3 aspartate, M3 malate, M3 fumarate and M5 citrate.

In addition, consistent with our previous data (Fig. 4C), expression of OGDHL also led to a concomitant increase in glucose oxidation as determined by the enrichment of M2 isotopomers using [U-13C6] glucose (Fig. 5C).

Moreover, as seen in Figure 5D, OGDHL-negative/OGDHL-positive HCC-LM3 cells exhibited similar degrees of M4 aspartate, M4 malate, M4 fumarate and M4 citrate isotopomers through glutamine oxidation.

We also examined the transfer of glutamine carbons to lactate to evaluate respiratory activity supported by glutaminolysis [34] and found that there was no significant change in glutamine-derived carbons in secreted lactate (M+3 lactate derived from [U-13C5] glutamine; Supplementary Fig. 11) among hepatoma cells with different levels of OGDHL expression, which was consistent with our previous results (Fig. 4C and 4D).

All of the above results revealed that lower OGDHL expression was necessary to stimulate RC through inhibition of OGDHC activity.

PARAGRAPH

Recent reports identified that reduction of OGDHC activity pushed the reverse TCA cycle towards citrate for further de novo lipogenesis in cancer cells [24, 35].

To this end, we also detected the relative contribution of [5-13C1] glutamine or [U-13C6] glucose into palmitate [13].

Labeled carbon metabolites from [5-13C1] glutamine can be transferred to fatty acids exclusively by RC, and the labeled carbon derived from [U-13C6] glucose can be incorporated into palmitate through the oxidative TCA cycle [36].

Both OGDHL-negative cells and OGDHL-positive cells with defective OGDHC activity exhibited high palmitate labeling from [5-13C1] glutamine; however, reintroduction of OGDHL resulted in low labeling from [5-13C1] glutamine and high labeling from [U-13C6] glucose (Fig. 5, E and F).

Next, we performed Isotopomer Spectral Analysis (ISA) to identify the specific contributions from glucose oxidation or glutamine reduction to fatty acid synthesis.

ISA identified that OGDHL-reconstituted HCC-LM3 cells mainly relied on glucose oxidation to generate lipogenic AcCoA, while OGDHL-negative cells and OGDHL-positive cells with defective OGDHC activity primarily employed RC (Supplementary Fig. 12).

These results indicated that OGDHC inactivation by lower OGDHL expression was necessary to upregulate the reductive utilization of glutamine for lipogenesis.

PARAGRAPH

To confirm that our conclusion was not cell line-specific, we generated OGDHL-knockdown clones in another hepatoma cell line, Bel-7402.

We found that knockdown OGDHL clones (sh-A and sh-B) in Bel-7402 induced the contribution of RC from glutamine (Supplementary Fig. 13A), as determined by the enrichment of labeled carbon metabolites (M3 aspartate, M3 malate, M3 fumarate and M5 citrate).

Similarly, the CESP group strengthened the activity of RC in OGDHL-knockdown clones (Supplementary Fig. 13A).

We also observed a concurrent modulation in glucose metabolism in these groups without alteration in glutamine oxidative metabolism (Supplementary Fig. 13, B and C).

Moreover, the treatment with CESP potentiated the knockdown of OGDHL in Bel-7402 cells with regards to glutamine reduction for lipogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 13, D and E), suggesting that OGDHC suppression by lower OGDHL expression was sufficient not only to induce RC in the TCA cycle but also to reverse the lipogenic switch from glucose to glutamine.

SECTION

The αKG:citrate ratio regulated by OGDHL was key to promoting RC in hepatoma cells

PARAGRAPH

A previous study reported that the αKG:citrate ratio was the principal driving force in promoting mitochondrial glutamine reductive metabolism regardless of the upstream regulation that initiated this change [12].

Consistent with this conclusion, we observed that citrate levels were attenuated, with αKG being simultaneously increased in OGDHL-deficient hepatoma cell lines (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. 14).

Therefore, we hypothesized that the αKG:citrate ratio regulated by OGDHL was key to promoting RC in hepatoma cells.

To further examine whether the mechanism by which OGDHL downregulation promotes RC results from upregulation of the αKG:citrate ratio, we replenished the intracellular pools of citrate with acetate (25 mmol/L, to restore the endogenous citrate pool) or citrate (0.3 mmol/L and 1.2 mmol/L), hoping to inhibit RC in the TCA cycle.

PARAGRAPH

In the administration of acetate, we tested the RC contribution to citrate with a [U-13C5] glutamine tracer and normalized it to the total glutamine contribution to citrate.

This normalization was applied to avoid the possibility of changing the metabolite pool size after supplementation of acetate, which subsequently drove an overall decline in glutamine contribution to the metabolites.

Addition of acetate reduced the αKG:citrate ratio (Fig. 6B) and similarly suppressed the normalized reductive glutamine contribution to citrate (Fig. 6C) in OGDHL-negative cells, with minimal effects shown in their OGDHL-reconstituted counterparts.

Furthermore, the administration of acetate also promoted oxidative glutamine metabolism in the TCA cycle (Fig. 6D).

PARAGRAPH

Next, we directly supplemented the medium with citrate, which influenced accurate assessments of intracellular citrate levels.

For this reason, it was not possible to measure the αKG:citrate ratio in this experiment.

Therefore, we examined the ratio of oxidative to reductive glutamine conversion based on M4 aspartate, M4 malate and M4 fumarate (oxidative contribution) and M3 aspartate, M3 malate and M3 fumarate (reductive contribution).

We observed that the ratio of oxidative to reductive glutamine utilization was upregulated with increasing citrate concentrations in OGDHL-negative HCC-LM3 cells (Fig. 6E), further revealing that the switch from reductive to oxidative glutamine contribution is a function of the αKG:citrate ratio in hepatoma cells.

HCCs with elevated glutamine availability are those commonly seen with activating β-catenin and glutamine synthetase (GS) overexpression [37].

Therefore, we assessed β-catenin signaling in hepatoma cells displaying different levels of OGDHL.

We first examined whether OGDHL-negative HCC-LM3 cells harbored any exon 3 of CTNNB1 mutations frequently reported to be associated with high β-catenin activity [44].

Notably, HCC-LM3 cells carried a large 258-bp in-frame deletion (Supplementary Fig. 15A), which could stabilize a constitutively active β-catenin due to its inability to have the priming phosphorylation by GSK3β and CK1 [43].

Next, we tried to examine whether there was an OGDHL-dependent effect on β-catenin activation by testing its downstream targets using qRT-PCR.

In contrast to our expectation, although changes were evident in the expression of CCND1 mRNA, none of the other β-catenin downstream target genes (GLUL, LGR5, AXIN2, TBX3, SLC13A3, ODAM, cMyc and CCNE1) were markedly increased under low levels of OGDHL (Supplementary Fig. 15C).

In addition, reconstitution of OGDHL in HCC-LM3 cells did not significantly affect the total and nuclear β-catenin protein levels (Supplementary Fig. 15B).

Moreover, the transcriptional activity of β-catenin was assessed using the luciferase-based TOP/FOP reporter system.

Consistently, we observed no alterations in the activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the aforementioned hepatoma cells (Supplementary Fig. 15D).

PARAGRAPH

To further validate our findings, we investigated β-catenin signaling in HCC tumors (cohort 2, n=90) displaying different levels of OGDHL using qRT-PCR.

Indeed, expressions of GLUL, AXIN2 and LGR5 mRNA in patients who had low OGDHL levels were not significantly higher than patients with high OGDHL levels (Supplementary Fig. 15E).

Similar results were also observed in the TCGA cohort (n=50; Supplementary Fig. 15F).

Taken together, these findings suggested that in our model, OGDHL impacted hepatic carcinogenesis independently from the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and that hepatic carcinogenesis may be driven by the modulation of specific gene programs involved in mitochondrial glutamine metabolism.

OGDHL modulated lipogenesis through mTORC1 and SREBP1 in an α-KG dependent manner

PARAGRAPH

Previous studies have also shown that increased glutamine or α-KG availability activated the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which serves a critical function in the regulation of cell metabolism, including fatty acid synthesis [38].

Since α-KG accumulated in OGDHL-downregulated hepatoma cells in our previous results (Fig. 6A), robust activation of mTORC1 function was suggested in OGDHL-negative HCC-LM3 cells in the present study, as evidenced by the increased phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and S6K (Supplementary Fig. 16A).

Furthermore, nuclear SREBP1, which performs the transcriptional function of this molecule, was remarkably upregulated to a similar expression level as that observed for total SREBP1, suggesting that silencing of OGHDL may facilitate the transcriptional activity of SREBP1 in hepatoma cells (Supplementary Fig. 16B).

Based on these results, we further identified that mTORC1 activity was dramatically induced in hepatoma cells with negative or reconstituted OGDHL expression upon supplementation with DM-KG, a cell-permeable α-KG analog.

Meanwhile, reconstitution of OGDHL suppressed protein expression of SREBP1, as well as its transcriptional targets fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), while treatment with DM-KG rescued their expression (Supplementary Fig. 16C).

As expected, we also observed increased fatty contents including intracellular TG and PL upon treatment with DM-KG (Supplementary Fig. 16, D and E).

Taken together, these results confirmed that mTORC1 signaling and its downstream target SREBP1 were activated in an α-KG-dependent manner in OGDHL-negative hepatoma cells, which in turn, transcriptionally stimulated the expression of FASN and SCD, thus, enhancing lipogenesis.

Inhibition of glutamine metabolism improved sorafenib chemo-sensitization in OGDHL-deficient hepatoma cells

PARAGRAPH

Sorafenib is the only FDA-approved drug for HCC patients.

Moreover, sorafenib-resistant hepatoma cells engaged in glutamine RC [39], while this reaction was inactive in OGDHL-overexpressing hepatoma cells.

Therefore, our next question was whether the suppression of glutamine RC by OGDHL reconstitution would sensitize OGDHL-deficient HCC-LM3 cells to sorafenib treatment.

Our results found that sorafenib almost completely retarded the proliferation of OGDHL-overexpressing hepatoma cells (Fig. 7A).

Meanwhile, sorafenib upregulated the percentage of apoptotic cells in OGDHL-reconstituted hepatoma cells (Fig. 7, B and C).

In addition, the effect of a glutamine metabolism inhibitor (968) on sorafenib chemo-sensitization under OGDHL-deficient conditions was investigated.

Firstly, the protein level of glutaminase 1 (GLS1), which is inhibited by 968, were highly expressed in HCC-LM3 cells (Supplementary Fig. 6).

Next, we determined that 968 was able to act synergistically with sorafenib to inhibit OGDHL-deficient HCC-LM3 cell proliferation in vitro (Fig. 7, D and E).

Consistent with the overexpression of OGDHL, sorafenib significantly enhanced apoptosis in HCC-LM3 cells that were treated with 968 (Fig. 7, F and G).

We also observed a similar effect using a different glutaminase inhibitor (bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide, BPTES), confirming the impact of the glutamine metabolism inhibitor on sorafenib chemo-sensitization in OGDHL-deficient hepatoma cells (Supplementary Fig. 17, A-D).

Moreover, the improvement of sorafenib chemo-sensitization by glutamine suppression under OGDHL-deficient conditions was not an in-vitro-only phenomenon.

We found that HCCs with reintroduced OGDHL were more sensitive to sorafenib treatment in the subcutaneous tumor model derived from OGDHL-deficient HCC-LM3 cells in nude mice (Fig. 8, A-C).

Tumor tissues from mice injected with Lenti-OGDHL HCC-LM3 cells had significantly decreased levels of TG and PL, compared to mice injected with OGDHL-negative HCC-LM3 cells (Fig. 8, D and E).

Moreover, exposure of Lenti-OGDHL-injected mice to sorafenib led to a marked reduction in TG and PL content relative to that in OGDHL-negative HCC-LM3-bearing mice treated with sorafenib (Fig. 8, D and E).

Strikingly, systemic administration of BPTES also enhanced sorafenib chemo-sensitization to reduce the proliferation of subcutaneous HCC tumors (Supplementary Fig. 17, E and F), highlighting the need for further investigation of this new HCC therapeutic regimen.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In the present study, we elucidated the function and clinical significance of OGDHL expression in HCC.

OGDH and OGDHL are the first and rate-limiting components of the OGDHC, and both regulate its activity.

Although both components are functionally competent to regulate OGDHC activity and exhibit a high degree of the sequence and secondary structure similarity (85% overall sequence similarity) [29], the roles of OGDH and OGDHL in tumor progression are still unknown.

On one hand, suppression of OGDH leads to a reduction of aspartate and deregulates the malate-aspartate shuttle, which is critical for cytoplasmic NAD+ regeneration that supports rapid glucose breakdown through glycolysis [40].

Therefore, dependence on OGDH activity is increased by the glycolytic nature of cancer cells, which have elevated glucose demand, especially in PIK3CA MUT cancer cells [40].

On the other hand, silencing of OGDH prevents prolyl hydroxylation from stabilizing HIF-1α, which may act as a tumor suppressor by disrupting the correct functioning of the OGDHC [35].

The role of OGDH or OGDHL in HCC progression has never been reported.

In our manuscript, we report that protein expression of OGDH was highly conserved in the panel of hepatoma cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 6), whereas silencing of OGDHL contributed to HCC progression by reprogramming glutamine metabolism, suggesting OGDHL as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in HCC.

PARAGRAPH

First, we validated that low OGDHL expression in primary HCC tissues was significantly associated with worse OS and RFS in three independent large cohorts, and the findings were reproducible (Fig. 2).

For both OS and RFS, each cohort exhibited this prognostic effect even after adjusting for cancer stage.

In addition, our results suggested that silencing of OGDHL expression promoted HCC progression, thereby reflecting the clinical characteristics and outcomes of HCC patients.

Collectively, we pinpointed OGDHL for the first time to our knowledge as a critical factor for assessing prognosis which can provide valuable prognostic information beyond tumor stage in HCC patients.

PARAGRAPH

Enhanced methylation in the OGDHL promoter downregulated its expression in patients with lung, breast, cervix, oesophagus, pancreas and colon cancers [20-21].

Alternatively, in our larger cohort analysis, we determined that both promoter hypermethylation and copy number loss could explain the reduction in OGDHL expression in HCC tissues (Fig. 1).

Therefore, our data suggested that alterations in genomic status as well as epigenetic modifications contributed to the silencing of OGDHL in HCC.

PARAGRAPH

Malignant cellular transformation goes hand-in-hand with cellular reprogrammed metabolism.

For de novo lipogenesis, AcCoA is a critical biosynthetic precursor, being produced from glucose-derived citrate in adequately oxygenated cells.

Hepatoma cells with compromised electron transport capacity (ETC) convert glucose to lactate without generating AcCoA, raising the question of how the TCA cycle is replenished with AcCoA to maintain lipid synthesis in rapid dividing cells.

Most certainly, neoplastic cells with a hypoxia-like metabolic phenotype or with ETC defects primarily utilize glutamine to produce AcCoA from RC of α-KG [10-11].

Notably, an aberrant increase in RC of glutamine-derived αKG for de novo lipogenesis was observed in hepatoma cells [8, 41-42] and conferred resistance to sorafenib, which was significantly associated with worse disease outcome [39].

Therefore, it is of utmost importance to investigate the oncogenic molecules involved in reprogramming the metabolic process that support this increased lipogenic program in HCC.

In our study, the metabolic reprogramming in OGDHL-downregulated hepatoma cells was glutamine-dependent (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 10).

Moreover, we validated that silenced OGDHL defined a metabolically active cellular state which utilized RC of glutamine-derived αKG for fatty acid biosynthesis via retrograde TCA cycling in hepatoma cells.

Although this RC pathway has been regarded as less efficient in mammalian cells, recent findings have found that tumor cells can efficiently utilize this pathway for lipogenesis [9, 11].

Alternatively, other studies have identified that suppression of OGDHC activity is associated with RC of glutamine-derived αKG [19, 24].

Consistent with this opinion, we provided evidence that downregulation of OGDHL expression induced RC in hepatoma cells by inhibiting the activity of OGDHC (Fig. 5), which led to mitochondrial dysfunction with a significant reduction in glucose oxygen consumption rates (Fig. 4).

These data were also in line with other reports which indicated that the disruption of the TCA cycle is triggered after the suppression of the OGDHC, with markedly reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates and subsequently decreased levels of mitochondrial intermediates [35].

In this case, cells utilize alternative metabolic process such as RC of glutamine-derived αKG to generate citrate for the biosynthesis of fatty acids and to maintain cancer cell proliferation [11-12].

PARAGRAPH

Mechanistically, the β-catenin pathway is commonly activated in HCC with elevated glutamine availability [37].

Notably, no significant alteration of β-catenin signaling in HCC tumors with different levels of OGDHL was observed in our cohort study (Supplementary Fig. 15E).

This finding appeared reasonable, because HCCs with CTNNB1 mutations commonly exhibit specific clinical and pathological characteristics.

These tumors are typically better differentiated, mostly occur in patients with a low prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, develop frequently in non-cirrhotic liver, and display a relatively better prognosis [43-45].

In contrast, in our cohort study the rates of chronic HBV infection and liver cirrhosis in the low OGDHL expression group were not significantly lower than the high OGDHL expression group (Supplementary Table 3).

Meanwhile, HCC patients with low OGDHL levels frequently had more poorly-differentiated tumors and a worse prognosis (Fig 2).

Since various studies reported that most HCCs with β-catenin activation harbor CTNNB1 mutations [44, 46], the failure to find the activation of β-catenin signaling in HCC tumors with decreased OGDHL expression was not unexpected.

In addition, although there was an apparent relationship between GS increase and OGDHL decrease in hepatoma cells (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. 6), the changes in GS expression did not appear to be OGDHL-driven (Supplementary Fig. 15C).

These results indicated that instead of intracellular glutamine synthesis, depletion of OGDHL in hepatoma cells had changed their access to extracellular glutamine by the concentrative uptake to guarantee sufficient glutamine supply as shown in Figure 4E and 4F.

PARAGRAPH

Next, our findings identified that silencing of OGDHL promoted mitochondrial glutamine metabolism for de novo lipogenesis in hepatoma cells via two interrelated metabolic processes by regulating the activity of the key mitochondrial enzyme OGDHC in the TCA cycle.

A recent publication has determined how high levels of αKG and low levels of intracellular citrate are related to hypoxia inducible factor-dependent reductive glutamine metabolism [36].

These elegant tracer results are entirely consistent with our data and complementary to our current findings.

The conclusions of these authors were based on alternations in metabolites during hypoxia but did not describe how these changes occurred in the process of mitochondrial dysfunction.

Our findings have broadened this understanding by providing evidence in hepatoma cells that silencing of OGDHL led to a reduction in glucose-derived citrate because of inhibited mitochondrial function, which in turn reduced pyruvate to acetyl CoA [12] and also upregulated αKG levels because of decreased OGDHC activity [35].

Therefore, these two interrelated metabolic processes affected the αKG:citrate ratio, which further caused the alteration in reductive versus oxidative glutamine utilization [12].

Indeed, to further support these results, we found that OGDHL-negative hepatoma cells possessed a high αKG:citrate ratio, while addition of exogenous acetate or citrate decreased the αKG:citrate ratio to levels encountered in OGDHL-repleted cells and suppressed RC.

Exogenous supplementation of citrate or acetate exhibited a mild effect on OGDHL-reconstituted cells.

In either case, the extent of changes in the intracellular αKG:citrate ratio reflected the magnitude of changes in RC (Fig. 6).

These observations showed that fluctuations in the αKG:citrate ratio modulated by OGDHL at least in part triggered the reversal RC reaction of glutamine-derived αKG.

PARAGRAPH

In addition, another metabolic change exhibited in our manuscript was that silencing of OGDHL activated the mTORC1 signaling pathway in hepatoma cells by enhancing the availability of cellular α-KG, which in turn directly upregulated expression of the SREBP1 transcription factor to induce expression of the key enzymes involved in de novo lipogenesis, SCD1 and FASN (Supplementary Fig. 16).

Thus, dynamic regulation by downregulated OGDHL in hepatoma cells, both as an OGDHC suppressor and mTORC1 activator, fine-tuned metabolic rewiring to favor the lipogenic program.

PARAGRAPH

The function of the TCA cycle and oxidative metabolism in cancer cells has been the subject of controversy.

For example, the most well-studied metabolic change is the Warburg effect, characterized by permanent impairment of oxidative metabolism.

On the other hand, cancer cells, including HCC cells, exhibit a high rate of de novo lipogenesis, which indicates an active function of the TCA cycle to support cancer cell growth.

The limited oxidative TCA cycle may be a secondary endpoint to metabolic changes such as enhanced de novo lipogenesis during the process that tumor cells utilize to incorporate glucose as the major lipogenic precursor [9].

In our manuscript, we report that reconstitution of OGHDL in HCC-LM3 cells led to recovery of oxidative metabolism (Fig. 4C).

However, our results also revealed an inactive TCA cycle allowing less lipid synthesis to occur after the suppression of reductive glutamine metabolism for de novo lipogenesis in OGDHL-reconstituted HCC-LM3 cells (Supplementary Fig. 12; Supplementary Fig. 16, D and E).

Therefore, reconstitution of OGDHL suppressed the high reliance on glutamine metabolism in hepatoma cells and fully attenuated the TCA cycle function needed for lipogenesis, even after substantial recovery of oxidative metabolism.

Glutamine provides essential precursors for NADPH and GSH biosynthesis.

Moreover, inefficiency of oxidative metabolism can maintain the cellular NADPH/NADP+ ratio partially by nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT), which transfers reducing equivalents from NADH to NADPH across the inner mitochondrial membrane [33, 47].

The increased ratios of NADPH/NADP+ and GSH/GSSG are required for the neutralization of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [33].

Indeed, we identified that OGDHL-negative hepatoma cells harbored higher NADPH and GSH concentrations than OGDHL-reconstituted hepatoma cells (Fig. 4), suggesting that a strong antioxidant response was activated, possibly participating in the growth of cancer cells.

Therefore, we speculate that metabolic reprogramming in OGDHL-negative hepatoma cells provides an abundant supply of NADPH and GSH, enabling cells to mitigate mitochondrial ROS and maximize growth.

PARAGRAPH

Sorafenib displays antiangiogenic effects by targeting receptor tyrosine kinases such as c-Kit, PDGFR and VEGFR.

The antiangiogenic effects of sustained sorafenib treatment lead to a reduction in microvessel density and intratumoral hypoxia that favor the selection of resistant cell clones adapted to the hypoxic microenvironment [48].

Recently, new evidence demonstrated that cancer cells grown in hypoxia preferentially use glutamine to generate citrate for lipid biosynthesis [13, 24].

Thus, hypoxia-induced glutamine-deregulated metabolism probably attenuated sorafenib therapy efficacy, hence the combination of sorafenib with glutamine metabolism inhibitors might be an alternative way to enhance sorafenib chemosensitivity.

Of note, our data showed that OGDHL-negative hepatoma cells were dependent on reductive glutamine metabolism, and either OGDHL upregulation or pharmacologic inhibitors of glutamine metabolism (968/BPTES) rendered OGDHL-deficient hepatoma cells more sensitive to sorafenib treatment.

PARAGRAPH

In summary, our article demonstrates the clinical significance of downregulated OGDHL expression in HCC patients in three large independent clinical cohorts.

Silencing of OGDHL via DNA copy loss and promoter hypermethylation contributes to tumor progression via reprogramming of glutamine metabolism.

OGDHL may therefore be a useful biomarker for assessing the prognosis of HCC patients and provide a novel targeted therapy for the treatment of HCC.
