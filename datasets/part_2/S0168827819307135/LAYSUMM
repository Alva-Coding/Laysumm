TITLE

MUC13 promotes intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma progression via EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathways

PARAGRAPH

Mucin 13 overexpression has been implicated in the development of malignancies, although its role in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma has not been studied.

Herein, we show that mucin 13 plays a critical role in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

Mucin 13 could have therapeutic value both as a prognostic marker and as a treatment target.
