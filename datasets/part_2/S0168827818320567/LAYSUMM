TITLE

Genetic inactivation of Nrf2 prevents clonal expansion of initiated cells in a nutritional model of rat hepatocarcinogenesis

PARAGRAPH

Dysregulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 molecular pathway has been observed in human tumors.

In a nutritional model of hepatocarcinogenesis, the protein Nrf2 is frequently mutated/activated at early steps of the tumorigenic process.

Herein, we show that Nrf2 is mandatory for the development of preneoplastic lesions.

These results suggest that Nrf2 has a critical role in the onset of hepatocellular carcinoma.
