TITLE

Effectiveness and safety of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir in patients with chronic hepatitis C previously treated with DAAs

PARAGRAPH

Treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX) for 12â€¯weeks is the current recommendation for the 5% of patients infected with HCV who do not achieve eradication of the virus under treatment with direct-acting antivirals.

In a Spanish cohort of 137 patients who failed a previous combination of direct-acting antivirals, a cure rate of 95% was achieved with SOF/VEL/VOX.

Genotypic characteristics of the virus (genotype 3) and the presence of cirrhosis were factors that decreased the rate of cure.

Treatment with SOF/VEL/VOX is an effective and safe rescue therapy due to its high efficacy and very good safety profile.
