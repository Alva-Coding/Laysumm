ABSTRACT

TITLE

Effectiveness and safety of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir in patients with chronic hepatitis C previously treated with DAAs

PARAGRAPH

Around 5% of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection treated with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents do not achieve sustained virological response (SVR).

The currently approved retreatment regimen for prior DAA failure is a combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX), although there is little data on its use in clinical practice.

The aim of this study was to analyse the effectiveness and safety of SOF/VEL/VOX in the real-world setting.

PARAGRAPH

This was a prospective multicentre study assessing the efficacy of retreatment with SOF/VEL/VOX in patients who had experienced a prior DAA treatment failure.

The primary endpoint was SVR 12 weeks after the completion of treatment (SVR12).

Data on safety and tolerability were also recorded.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 137 patients were included: 75% men, 35% with liver cirrhosis.

Most were infected with HCV genotype (GT) 1 or 3.

The most common prior DAA combinations were sofosbuvir plus an NS5A inhibitor or ombitasvir/paritaprevir/r+dasabuvir.

A total of 136 (99%) patients achieved undetectable HCV RNA at the end of treatment.

Overall SVR12 was 95% in the 135 patients reaching this point.

SVR12 was lower in patients with cirrhosis (89%, p = 0.05) and those with GT3 infection (80%, p <0.001).

Patients with GT3 infection and cirrhosis had the lowest SVR12 rate (69%).

Of the patients who did not achieve SVR12, 1 was reinfected and 7 experienced treatment failure (6 GT3, 1 GT1a).

The presence of resistance-associated substitutions did not impact SVR12.

Adverse effects were mild and non-specific.

PARAGRAPH

Real-world data show that SOF/VEL/VOX is an effective, safe rescue therapy for patients with prior DAA treatment failure despite the presence of resistance-associated substitutions.

However, patients with liver cirrhosis infected by GT3 remain the most-difficult-to-treat group.
