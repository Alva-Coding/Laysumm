TITLE

Inherited non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and dyslipidemia due to monoallelic ABHD5 mutations

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common multifactorial disorder with a strong genetic component.

Inherited forms of NAFLD have been suspected but, their molecular pathogenesis has not been disclosed.

Here we report a heritable form of NAFLD with clinical expression after 40 years of age, associated with monoallelic ABHD5 mutations.
