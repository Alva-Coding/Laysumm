TITLE

Beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention in non-obese patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

PARAGRAPH

Some patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are non-obese.

The optimal management of such patients is unclear.

In this long-term follow-up study of a clinical trial, we show that remission of NAFLD can be achieved in 67% of non-obese patients after lifestyle intervention.

The majority of patients can achieve NAFLD remission with modest weight loss of 3â€“10%.

Non-obese patients are also more likely than obese patients to maintain weight reduction and normal liver enzymes in the long run.
