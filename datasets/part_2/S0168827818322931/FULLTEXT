TITLE

Beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention in non-obese patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common chronic liver disease and is one of the leading causes of end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide.1,2

Although NAFLD is strongly associated with metabolic syndrome and obesity,3 around 10–20% of patients with NAFLD have a relatively normal body mass index (BMI), a condition often described as non-obese or lean NAFLD.4

Studies based on liver histology or non-invasive tests of fibrosis suggest that these non-obese patients may also harbour non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and advanced fibrosis.5–8

PARAGRAPH

Similar to the management of other metabolic disorders, lifestyle modification is the cornerstone for the management of NAFLD.

A number of diets including low-carbohydrate diet, low-fat diet, low-glycaemic index diet and the Mediterranean diet have been shown to improve liver enzyme levels, liver fat, and histology in patients with NAFLD.9–17

Likewise, beneficial effects have been observed for both aerobic exercise and resistance training.18,19

In particular, a reduction of 10% or more in body weight results in the remission of NAFLD and NASH in the majority and improvement in liver fibrosis in almost half of patients.20,21

PARAGRAPH

Nonetheless, while weight reduction makes sense for obese individuals, there have been no data on the efficacy of lifestyle intervention in non-obese patients with NAFLD.4

It is also unclear if clinicians should recommend such patients to lose weight.

With this background, we report the one- and six-year outcomes of non-obese and obese patients with NAFLD in a clinical trial on lifestyle intervention.

We hypothesise that lifestyle intervention is effective in treating NAFLD in both non-obese and obese patients.

We also hypothesise that weight reduction is predictive of remission of NAFLD in the non-obese population.

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Study design

PARAGRAPH

This was a parallel group, superiority, single-blind randomised controlled trial comparing a community-based lifestyle intervention programme and standard care in patients with NAFLD (NCT00868933).

Additional details of the trial can be found in the supplementary methods.

The 12-month results of the entire cohort have been reported.20

After the 12-month trial period, the patients were prospectively followed with yearly anthropometric and laboratory assessments.

Here we report the one- and six-year results with stratified analysis by baseline BMI.

SECTION

Study population

PARAGRAPH

Patients with NAFLD were recruited from a population screening project using proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and transient elastography.3,22

Potential patients were randomly sampled from the government census database.

Those with an intrahepatic triglyceride content (IHTG) of 5% or above were invited to participate in this trial.

Other inclusion criteria included age 18 to 70 years and elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level (≥30 U/L in men and ≥19 U/L in women).

Exclusion criteria included positive hepatitis B surface antigen or anti-hepatitis C virus antibody; excessive alcohol consumption (>20 g/day in men and >10 g/day in women); liver decompensation; terminal illness and history of malignancy including hepatocellular carcinoma.

Because non-invasive tests were used, we could not distinguish between non-alcoholic fatty liver and NASH and thus used the term NAFLD to describe the entire cohort.

All participants provided informed written consent.

The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong-New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics Committee.

SECTION

Study intervention

PARAGRAPH

Patients randomised to the intervention group participated in a lifestyle intervention programme led by dietitians and exercise trainers for 12 months.

All patients received individual education at two community centres and attended consultation sessions weekly in the first four months and monthly for the remaining eight months.

The programme focused on increasing energy expenditure and reducing caloric intake.

In addition, the exercise instructor reviewed the patient’s medical history and exercise habits, and designed a suitable exercise regimen for the patient.

PARAGRAPH

In comparison, patients in the control group received routine care at the medical clinic of the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong.

At baseline, a clinician explained the laboratory results and the natural history of NAFLD to the patients.

The patients were advised to reduce carbohydrate and fat intake, and to exercise at least three times per week, for 30 min per session.

PARAGRAPH

After the first year, patients were seen by one of the investigators (VWW or GLW) at least yearly, who provided advice on diet and exercise and reviewed the control of blood pressure, glycaemia and lipids.

SECTION

Clinical assessments

PARAGRAPH

The patients attended the clinic at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months during the trial period, and yearly thereafter.

At each visit, the body weight, waist circumference and blood pressure were measured.

BMI was calculated as body weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared.

Waist circumference was measured at a level midway between the lower rib margin and iliac crest with the tape all around the body in the horizontal position.

A venous blood sample was taken after at least 8 h of fasting for liver biochemistry, plasma glucose and lipids.

PARAGRAPH

1H-MRS and liver stiffness measurement were performed at baseline and Month 12.

IHTG was measured by 1H-MRS using a whole-body 3.0 T scanner with a single voxel point-resolved spectroscopy sequence and an echo time of 40 ms and repetition time of 5,000 ms.23 Liver stiffness measurement was performed by transient elastography (FibroScan, Echosens, Paris, France) by operators who had performed at least 50 examinations in the past according to the training and instructions provided by the manufacturers.24

The median of 10 measurements was taken to reflect the liver stiffness.

Cases with less than 10 successful acquisitions or an interquartile range-to-median ratio of 0.3 or more were considered to have invalid measurements and were excluded from analysis.

SECTION

Study outcomes

PARAGRAPH

The primary outcome was remission of NAFLD at Month 12, defined as an IHTG below 5.0% by 1H-MRS.

Secondary outcomes include changes in IHTG, liver stiffness, body weight, ALT, glucose, lipids and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI).

APRI was calculated as (AST/upper limit of normal)/platelet count (×109/L) × 100.25

While IHTG and liver stiffness were measured at baseline and Month 12, the anthropometric measurements and laboratory parameters were assessed yearly through Year 6.

Although IHTG was not repeated at Year 6, we calculated the fatty liver index (FLI) to estimate the persistence of NAFLD using the following formula: FLI=e0.953∗loge(triglycerides)+0.139∗BMI+0.718∗loge(ggt)+0.053∗waist circumference-15.7451+e0.953∗loge(triglycerides)+0.139∗BMI+0.718∗loge(ggt)+0.053∗waist circumference-15.745∗100

PARAGRAPH

An FLI of <30 and ≥60 suggests low and high likelihood of NAFLD, respectively.26

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

We performed all statistical tests using IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).

Continuous variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range), and compared using unpaired t test or Mann–Whitney U test as appropriate.

Categorical variables were compared using chi-square test.

We performed binary logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with remission of NAFLD at Month 12.

Factors in the multivariable analysis were selected by forward condition method.

A 2-sided p value of <0.05 was taken as statistically significant.

PARAGRAPH

The primary outcome, remission of NAFLD at Month 12, was evaluated by intention-to-treat analysis, with patients lost to follow-up considered as having persistent NAFLD.

However, because more patients in the control group were lost to follow-up in the Year 6 analysis, we adopted the per protocol analysis to avoid bias in favouring the intervention group.

In the per protocol analysis, only patients remaining in follow-up were evaluated.

PARAGRAPH

The original sample size of this cohort was determined based on the rate of spontaneous remission of NAFLD in previous observational studies.

Assuming that 45% of patients in the intervention group and 20% of those in the control group could achieve remission of NAFLD, a sample size of 62 patients per group would achieve 80% power to detect the difference at a 5% significance level.

Allowing an attrition rate of 20%, a total sample size of 155 patients was required.

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

From May 2008 to September 2010, 264 individuals were found to have fatty liver through population screening.

After excluding patients with excessive alcohol consumption, normal serum ALT level and refusal to consent, 154 patients with NAFLD were randomised to receive lifestyle intervention (n = 77) or standard care (n = 77) (Fig. 1).

In each group, 39 and 38 patients had baseline BMI <25 and ≥25 kg/m2, respectively.

As expected, patients with baseline BMI ≥25 kg/m2 had higher baseline body weight and waist circumference than those <25 kg/m2, but the comorbidities and metabolic profile of patients in the two BMI categories were otherwise similar (Table 1).

Likewise, the clinical characteristics were well balanced in the lifestyle intervention and control groups in both BMI categories.

SECTION

Liver and metabolic outcomes at Month 12

PARAGRAPH

Among patients with baseline BMI <25 kg/m2, 67% in the intervention group had remission of NAFLD, compared with 18% in the control group (p <0.001) (Table 2).

The mean decline in IHTG was 6.1% and 1.3%, respectively (p = 0.001).

There was a trend that lifestyle intervention resulted in a greater decrease in liver stiffness (−0.6 vs. +0.1 kPa in controls; p = 0.070).

Although the change in serum ALT and AST levels was not statistically different, more patients in the intervention group achieved ALT normalisation at Month 12 (49% vs. 23%; p = 0.018).

APRI decreased by 0.06 in the intervention group and 0.03 in the control group (p = 0.28).

PARAGRAPH

Among patients with baseline BMI ≥25 kg/m2, 61% in the intervention group and 21% in the control group had remission of NAFLD (p <0.001).

The mean decline in IHTG was 7.4% and 2.9%, respectively (p = 0.004).

Lifestyle intervention resulted in a greater decrease in liver stiffness (−0.7 vs. +0.3 kPa in controls; p = 0.048).

It also resulted in a greater decrease in serum ALT level and a higher likelihood of ALT normalisation (58% vs. 26%; p = 0.005).

APRI decreased by 0.05 in the intervention group and 0.02 in the control group (p = 0.095).

In the intervention group, a similar proportion of patients with baseline BMI <25 and ≥25 kg/m2 achieved remission of NAFLD (67% vs. 61%; p = 0.58).

PARAGRAPH

Among patients with baseline BMI <25 kg/m2, lifestyle intervention also led to a greater decrease in body weight, BMI and fasting glucose but did not affect the lipid profile (Table 2).

Among patients with baseline BMI ≥25 kg/m2, lifestyle intervention resulted in a greater decrease in body weight and increased the high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level.

SECTION

Predictors of NAFLD remission at Month 12 in non-obese patients

PARAGRAPH

Among patients with baseline BMI <25 kg/m2, factors associated with remission of NAFLD at Month 12 included participation in the lifestyle intervention programme, lower baseline IHTG, and decrease in body weight, waist circumference and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol from baseline to Month 12 (Table 3).

By multivariable analysis, participation in the lifestyle intervention programme, lower baseline IHTG, and decrease in body weight and waist circumference remained as independent factors associated with remission of NAFLD.

PARAGRAPH

If we restricted the analysis to patients who participated in the lifestyle intervention programme, factors associated with remission of NAFLD included lower baseline IHTG, higher baseline LDL-cholesterol and decrease in body weight, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, total and LDL-cholesterol from baseline to Month 12 (Table S1).

None of these factors remained independently associated with remission of NAFLD in the multivariable analysis.

PARAGRAPH

In both patients with baseline BMI <25 and ≥25 kg/m2, the degree of weight reduction from baseline to Month 12 was associated with remission of NAFLD at Month 12 in a dose-dependent manner (p <0.001 for trend in both groups) (Fig. 2).

At every weight reduction category, patients with baseline BMI <25 kg/m2 were more likely to achieve remission of NAFLD than those with BMI ≥25 kg/m2.

Of patients with baseline BMI <25 kg/m2, 50% could achieve remission of NAFLD with a 3–5% weight reduction; the same could only be achieved in patients with baseline BMI ≥25 kg/m2 with a 7–10% weight reduction.

With a weight reduction of 7–10%, 70% of patients with baseline BMI <25 kg/m2 could achieve remission of NAFLD.

SECTION

Durability of lifestyle intervention

PARAGRAPH

At Year 6, patients in the intervention group remained more likely to achieve weight reduction and less likely to experience weight gain (Fig. 3).

In the intervention group, 19.1% of patients had decreased BMI compared with baseline, 73.5% had static BMI, and 7.4% had increased BMI.

By comparison, 8.6% of patients in the control group had decreased BMI, 70.7% had static BMI, and 20.7% had increased BMI (p = 0.037 compared with the intervention group).

PARAGRAPH

In the entire cohort, the intervention group had significantly greater weight reduction than the control group from Month 3 onwards.

Although rebound in body weight was observed in the intervention group after Month 12, weight reduction remained significantly different between the two groups throughout six years of follow-up.

The mean change of body weight from baseline to Month 12 was −5.6 ± 4.4 kg in the intervention group and −0.6 ± 2.5 kg in the control group (p <0.001).

The mean change in body weight from baseline to Year 6 was −1.9 ± 4.7 kg in the intervention group and 0.4 ± 3.3 kg in the control group (p = 0.002) (Fig. 4A).

Among patients with baseline BMI <25 kg/m2, the mean change of body weight was −4.2 ± 3.5 kg in the intervention group and −0.2 ± 2.4 kg in the control group from baseline to Month 12 (p <0.001), and −1.9 ± 3.2 kg in the intervention group and 0.6 ± 3.0 kg in the control group from baseline to Year 6 (p = 0.002).

Among patients with baseline BMI ≥25 kg/m2, the mean change in body weight was −7.0 ± 4.8 kg in the intervention group and −1.0 ± 2.5 kg in the control group from baseline to Month 12 (p <0.001), and −1.9 ± 5.9 kg in the intervention group and 0.2 ± 3.6 kg in the control group from baseline to Year 6 (p = 0.10).

PARAGRAPH

The serum ALT level decreased during the 12 months of lifestyle intervention programme in both patients with baseline BMI <25 and ≥25 kg/m2 (Fig. 4B).

After Month 12, the mean ALT level remained static through Year 6 among patients with baseline BMI <25 kg/m2.

In contrast, the ALT level rebounded to the baseline level after the end of the lifestyle intervention programme among patients with baseline BMI ≥25 kg/m2.

By Year 6, 46% of patients with baseline BMI <25 kg/m2 in the intervention group and 17% of those in the control group had normal ALT (p = 0.013) (Table 4).

Among patients with baseline BMI ≥25 kg/m2, a similar proportion of patients in the intervention and control groups had normal ALT by Year 6 (27% vs. 30%; p = 0.84).

Furthermore, regardless of baseline BMI, the change in fasting glucose and lipid profile from baseline to Year 6 did not differ between the intervention and control groups.

PARAGRAPH

Among patients with baseline BMI <25 kg/m2, the median (interquartile range) FLI at Year 6 was 21 (14–33) in the intervention group and 21 (14–48) in the control group (p = 0.55).

Although not statistically significant, more non-obese patients in the intervention group had FLI <30 at Year 6 suggestive of NAFLD remission.

In the intervention and control groups, 71% vs. 57% had FLI <30, 17% vs. 30% had FLI 30–59, and 11% vs. 13% had FLI ≥60, respectively (p = 0.42).

In contrast, patients with baseline BMI ≥25 kg/m2 had higher FLI at Year 6 (p <0.001 compared with patients with BMI <25 kg/m2, both in the entire population and the treatment groups).

In obese patients, FLI at Year 6 was 53 (24–73) in the intervention group and 58 (45–73) in the control group (p = 0.42).

Although not statistically significant, more obese patients in the intervention group had FLI <30 at Year 6 suggestive of NAFLD remission.

In the intervention and control groups, 33% vs. 19% had FLI <30, 24% vs. 37% had FLI 30–59, and 42% vs. 44% had FLI ≥60, respectively (p = 0.36).

Again, obese patients in both treatment groups were less likely to have FLI <30 than non-obese patients (p < 0.001).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this randomised controlled trial, we show that a dietitian-led lifestyle intervention programme is effective in treating NAFLD in both non-obese and obese patients.

Despite relatively normal BMI, reduction in body weight and waist circumference remain important predictors for remission of NAFLD in non-obese patients.

Nonetheless, because a higher proportion of non-obese patients could achieve remission of NAFLD than obese patients for the same degree of weight reduction, a 5–10% reduction in body weight may be a reasonable target in non-obese patients.

PARAGRAPH

Lifestyle intervention is central in the management of NAFLD.27

Both dietary intervention and exercise programmes have been shown to improve liver fat and histological severity in patients with NAFLD.9–15,18

In a single arm study of 261 patients with NAFLD and paired liver biopsy one year apart, a weight reduction of ≥10% resulted in remission of NASH in 90% of patients and fibrosis improvement in 45%.21

However, all of the patients in that study were either overweight or obese.

Likewise, non-obese patients were underrepresented in other lifestyle intervention studies.

Our study clearly confirms that lifestyle intervention is equally effective in non-obese patients and should therefore be offered.

Low IHTG at baseline was also an independent predictor of NAFLD remission, suggesting that patients with milder disease are easier to manage with lifestyle intervention.

PARAGRAPH

Another question commonly raised by clinicians and researchers is whether one should recommend weight reduction in patients with NAFLD and relatively normal BMI.4

In this study, reduction in body weight and waist circumference predicted remission of NAFLD in non-obese patients.

The degree of weight reduction further correlated with NAFLD remission in a dose-dependent manner.

Importantly, while all non-obese patients achieved remission of NAFLD with ≥10% weight reduction, 70% of those with 5–10% weight reduction could also achieve remission of NAFLD (Fig. 2).

The proportion of non-obese patients achieving remission of NAFLD with modest weight reduction was higher than that in obese patients.

Thus, while the benefit of lifestyle intervention on NAFLD is also mediated by weight reduction in non-obese patients, a lower weight reduction target may suffice in this population.

PARAGRAPH

Previous studies have confirmed that non-obese patients with NAFLD are metabolically unhealthy.

They often have insulin resistance and abnormal adipokine levels.5,28

Lifestyle intervention is thus important in this context.

In patients with prediabetes, lifestyle intervention is more effective than insulin sensitizers such as metformin in preventing progression to diabetes.29

PARAGRAPH

In this study, lifestyle intervention led to a significant reduction in liver stiffness measurement by transient elastography among obese patients, but the difference did not reach statistical significance in non-obese patients (Table 2).

Likewise, there was a trend that APRI decreased more in obese patients undergoing lifestyle intervention.

The modest change was likely due to the small number of patients with advanced disease in the community setting.22

PARAGRAPH

While our study confirms the short-term efficacy of lifestyle intervention, it is clear that the benefit waned over time after the end of the programme.

This reflects the inherent difficulty in maintaining dietary changes and exercise habits.30

In the Look AHEAD study, intensive lifestyle intervention failed to reduce cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes, partly because of a regain of body weight after the first year.31

Nevertheless, our study shows that non-obese patients had less body weight rebound and were able to maintain ALT normalisation for six years.

This suggests that less intensive methods may be sufficient to maintain the metabolic benefits in non-obese patients, though this notion needs to be confirmed by prospective studies.

In the National Weight Control Registry, around 20% of patients could maintain their body weight after ≥10% weight reduction.32

Maintenance of healthy diet, self-monitoring of body weight, and consistent eating pattern across weekdays and weekends were predictors of weight maintenance.

PARAGRAPH

The reason for NAFLD development in non-obese people remains elusive.

One explanation is that BMI is a convenient but imperfect measurement of adiposity; it cannot distinguish between fat and muscle.

Insulin resistance is almost universal in patients with NAFLD regardless of BMI.33

Taylor and Holman also proposed the personal fat threshold concept to explain the development of type 2 diabetes in patients with relatively normal BMI.34

This concept can be illustrated in some clinical scenarios.

For instance, pioglitazone reduces hepatic steatosis despite weight gain.35

In this situation, the expansion of subcutaneous fat for fat storage may increase the personal fat threshold.

In contrast, lipodystrophy reduces the personal fat threshold and leads to hepatic steatosis at a low BMI.

With these underlying mechanisms, lifestyle intervention is also expected to work in non-obese patients.

PARAGRAPH

Our study has the strengths of prospective design and long-term data, but it also has a few limitations.

First, the number of patients in each subgroup was relatively small.

However, the difference in remission of NAFLD and weight reduction in both non-obese and obese patients was marked between the intervention and control groups.

Second, like other lifestyle intervention trials, the attrition was greater in the control group.

We limited the bias by per protocol analysis of long-term data.

Besides, since control patients who were lost to follow-up were probably less adherent to lifestyle advice, the actual difference between the intervention and control groups is likely to be greater.

Third, because liver biopsy was not performed, we could not evaluate histological features such as lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning.

However, this was a community cohort of otherwise healthy individuals.

Liver biopsy could not be justified.

We also performed transient elastography to estimate liver fibrosis.

Finally, it was impossible to blind the patients to treatment allocation in a lifestyle intervention trial.

This might have affected their behaviour.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, lifestyle intervention is effective in treating NAFLD in both non-obese and obese patients.

Weight reduction predicts remission of NAFLD in non-obese patients, but a modest weight reduction of 5–10% may be sufficient in this population.
