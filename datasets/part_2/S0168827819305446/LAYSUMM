TITLE

Fresh frozen plasma transfusion in patients with cirrhosis and coagulopathy: Effect on conventional coagulation tests and thrombomodulin-modified thrombin generation

PARAGRAPH

Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma in patients with cirrhosis only slightly improves coagulation test values in a limited number of patients and even appears to worsen them in a third of cases.

Transfusion for the purpose of preventing or treating bleeding events could cause inherent risks and costs without clear benefits.
