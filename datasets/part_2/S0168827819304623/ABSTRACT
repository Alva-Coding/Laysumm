ABSTRACT

TITLE

Sustained virological response from interferon-based hepatitis C regimens is associated with reduced risk of extrahepatic manifestations

PARAGRAPH

HCV infection is associated with several extrahepatic manifestations (EHMs).

We evaluated the impact of sustained virological response (SVR) on the risk of 7 EHMs that contribute to the burden of extrahepatic disease: type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease, stroke, ischemic heart disease, major adverse cardiac events, mood and anxiety disorders, and rheumatoid arthritis.

PARAGRAPH

A longitudinal cohort study was conducted using data from the British Columbia Hepatitis Testers Cohort, which included ~1.3 million individuals screened for HCV.

We identified all HCV-infected individuals who were treated with interferon-based therapies between 1999 and 2014.

SVR was defined as a negative HCV RNA test ≥24 weeks post-treatment or after end-of-treatment, if unavailable.

We computed adjusted subdistribution hazard ratios (asHR) for the effect of SVR on each EHM using competing risk proportional hazard models.

Subgroup analyses by birth cohort, sex, injection drug exposure and genotype were also performed.

PARAGRAPH

Overall, 10,264 HCV-infected individuals were treated with interferon, of whom 6,023 (59%) achieved SVR.

Compared to those that failed treatment, EHM risk was significantly reduced among patients with SVR for type 2 diabetes mellitus (asHR 0.65; 95% CI 0.55–0.77), chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease (asHR 0.53; 95% CI 0.43–0.65), ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (asHR 0.73; 95% CI 0.49–1.09), and mood and anxiety disorders (asHR 0.82; 95% CI 0.71–0.95), but not for ischemic heart disease (asHR 1.23; 95% CI 1.03–1.47), major adverse cardiac events (asHR 0.93; 95% CI 0.79–1.11) or rheumatoid arthritis (asHR 1.09; 95% CI 0.73–1.64).

PARAGRAPH

SVR was associated with a reduction in the risk of several EHMs.

Increased uptake of antiviral therapy may reduce the growing burden of EHMs in this population.
