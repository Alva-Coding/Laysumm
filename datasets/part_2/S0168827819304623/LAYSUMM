TITLE

Sustained virological response from interferon-based hepatitis C regimens is associated with reduced risk of extrahepatic manifestations

PARAGRAPH

We estimated the rates of chronic comorbidities other than liver disease between those who were cured and those who failed treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

Our findings showed that the rates of these non-liver diseases were largely reduced for those who were cured with interferon-based treatments.

Early HCV treatments could provide many benefits in the prevention of various HCV complications beyond liver disease.
