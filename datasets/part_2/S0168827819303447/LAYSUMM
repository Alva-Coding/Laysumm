TITLE

Activation of YAP attenuates hepatic damage and fibrosis in liver ischemia-reperfusion injury

PARAGRAPH

In the clinical arm, graft YAP expression negatively correlated with liver function and tissue damage after human liver transplantation.

YAP activation attenuated hepatocellular oxidative stress and diminished the innate immune response in mouse livers following ischemia-reperfusion injury.

In the mouse model, YAP inhibited hepatic stellate cell activation, and abolished injury-mediated fibrogenesis up to 7â€¯days after the ischemic insult.
