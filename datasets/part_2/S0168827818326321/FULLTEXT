TITLE

Normothermic regional perfusion vs. super-rapid recovery in controlled donation after circulatory death liver transplantation

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors, who are declared dead following cardiorespiratory arrest, are an increasingly common source of organs.

The period of donor warm ischaemia surrounding arrest can damage the quality of organs in general and the liver in particular, because biliary cells are exquisitely susceptible to warm ischaemia.1

Thus, initial experiences with DCD liver transplantation described high rates of graft dysfunction and non-function and ischaemic type biliary lesions (ITBL).

Although complication rates have improved with experience, the rate of post-transplant ITBL remains higher among recipients of DCD grafts vs. those receiving donation after brain death (DBD) grafts (16% vs. 3%, according to 2 meta-analyses2,3).

Development of ITBL leads to repeat biliary procedures and hospitalisations; up to 70% of patients with ITBL either require retransplantation or die.4

PARAGRAPH

Although DCD donors are typically classified among 4 categories depending on conditions surrounding cardiac arrest,5 category III controlled DCD (cDCD) donors are the most frequent source of DCD organs for transplantation globally.

These are ventilated patients with a devastating brain injury that does not meet the criteria for brain death; the decision is made to withdraw life-sustaining therapy because it is no longer beneficial.

Experience gained over the years has allowed for better donor and graft selection to the point that outcomes are comparable to those achieved with livers arising through donation after brain death.6,7

However, achieving these results has come at the cost of high liver discard rates.8

PARAGRAPH

In contrast to most of the Western world, the initial Spanish experience with DCD was with donors suffering sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who were unable to be resuscitated after repeated attempts.

Category II uncontrolled DCD (uDCD) donors are declared dead in the hospital, and femoral vasculature is cannulated to establish normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) to reperfuse and reoxygenate abdominal organs while donor evaluation and preparations for organ recovery are undertaken.9,10

Using NRP, even livers with extensive prerecovery warm ischaemic periods of up to 2.5 h have been successfully transplanted, with biliary complication and graft survival rates comparable to those seen using cDCD livers exposed to considerably shorter periods of warm ischaemia.9–13

PARAGRAPH

In 2009, cDCD was piloted in Spain, and a legal and ethical framework for its widespread practice was established in 2012.14,15

Unlike the rest of the world, where reports of the use of NRP in cDCD have been anecdotal,16,17 approximately 25% of all cDCD transplants and 50% of all cDCD liver transplants performed in Spain have included postmortem NRP.

Here, we report an analysis of the first years of the Spanish experience with cDCD liver transplantation, in particular regarding the hypothesis that the use of postmortem NRP improves organ utilisation rates and post-transplantation outcomes.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Study design

PARAGRAPH

This was an observational cohort study of all potential cDCD liver donors evaluated and the resulting transplants that took place between June 2012 and December 2016 in Spain, in accordance with the Spanish National DCD Protocol.15

Outcomes were evaluated until the end of December 2017.

SECTION

Donor selection and procedure

PARAGRAPH

Potential cDCD donors are ventilated patients with devastating brain injury who do not meet brain death criteria, but in whom the decision is made to withdraw life-sustaining therapy on grounds of futility.

Transplant coordination converses with next-of-kin to determine whether organ donation is consistent with the wishes and values of the patient.

A decision is made regarding the location and timing of ventilator withdrawal.

If any premortem intervention (i.e., heparinisation or cannulation) is considered, specific authorisation is obtained from legal representative(s).

The local liver transplant team is alerted regarding the potential cDCD donor.

If the local team declines the offer, it is extended to other groups, in order of geographic proximity.

PARAGRAPH

Each donor hospital determines its practice regarding the process by which cDCD organs are recovered.

Options include NRP with premortem vessel cannulation, NRP with postmortem cannulation, and super-rapid recovery (SRR).

SECTION

NRP with premortem vessel cannulation

PARAGRAPH

A bolus of heparin is administered, and cannulation of unilateral femoral vessels is performed, as described previously.10

The contralateral femoral artery is cannulated with a deflated aortic occlusion balloon catheter, advanced into the supracoeliac aorta under radiographic control.

For a visual representation of the NRP set-up, we refer readers to a previous publication depicting its use in uDCD.9

PARAGRAPH

With cannulation complete, the physicians in charge of patient care disconnect the endotracheal tube from the ventilator, marking the start of total warm ischaemia (>90 min being a contraindication to liver recovery).

The time at which systolic blood pressure drops below 60 mmHg and/or the arterial oxygen saturation drops below 80% marks the start of functional warm ischaemia (>30 min being a contraindication to liver recovery).

Death is declared after 5 min of complete absence of spontaneous circulation and respiration.14

The aortic occlusion balloon is then inflated and the NRP circuit initiated.

Proper positioning of the balloon excluding the aortic arch vessels is confirmed by chest radiograph and absence of flow measured in the left radial arterial catheter.

PARAGRAPH

Blood is sampled at baseline and every 30 min during NRP to determine biochemical, haematological and acid–base parameters.

Pump flow is maintained >1.7 L/min/m2, temperature at 37 °C, PaO2 at 100–150 mmHg and haematocrit >20%.

Hepatic transaminases should remain stable throughout NRP; levels more than 3 times the upper limit of normal at baseline and/or more than 4 times the upper limit of normal at the end of NRP are considered relative contraindications for liver recovery.9,10

In general, NRP is run for 60–120 min to allow adequate reconditioning of the abdominal organs.

SECTION

NRP with postmortem vessel cannulation

PARAGRAPH

Once death has been declared, the surgical team performs a midline laparotomy to cannulate the abdominal aorta and infrarenal inferior vena cava, proximal to and distal to their bifurcations, respectively.

The supracoeliac aorta is clamped, and NRP is initiated.

SECTION

SRR

PARAGRAPH

Once death has been declared, the surgical team performs a midline laparotomy to cannulate the distal abdominal aorta, clamp the supracoeliac aorta, and flush the cold preservation solution, which is vented through the inferior vena cava.

SECTION

Recipient selection and procedure

PARAGRAPH

Individual programs have their own policies regarding the recipients of cDCD livers, some choosing the first on the waiting list organised according to their model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, whereas others opt for low-risk patients.

SECTION

Outcomes

PARAGRAPH

Primary non-function was defined as immediate graft failure resulting in either retransplantation or death within the first week.

Early allograft dysfunction was defined according to Olthoff’s definition.18

Diagnosis of ITBL was contemplated in recipients with cholestasis and confirmed based on cholangiographic evidence (typically coming from magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) of diffuse non-anastomotic biliary strictures, with or without prestenotic dilatations, in the presence of a patent hepatic artery.19

All deaths were considered graft loss, even if the patient died with a functioning liver.

SECTION

Legislative, institutional and recipient approval

PARAGRAPH

The legal basis for the application of NRP in cDCD in Spain was established by Royal Decree 1723/2012 and national protocols.15

Local protocols have been approved by the institutional ethics committees in each participating centre.

Patients listed for liver transplantation at each centre were informed of the possibility of receiving a DCD liver and signed their consent.

SECTION

Data and statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Categorical variables are described as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables as mean (standard deviation) or median (25–75% interquartile range).

Survival was evaluated according to the Kaplan-Meier method.

The propensity score method, which simulates the effects of a randomised trial for observational data, was used to estimate study outcomes.

Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) of the propensity scores was used to create a pseudo-population in which study groups were balanced across covariates using data blinded to outcomes.

The weights were derived using logistic regression to estimate average treatment effects in treated patients and stabilised by treatment prevalence.

The following covariates were included in the propensity models: donor age, sex, cause of death, and intensive care stay; donor total and functional warm ischaemia; cold ischaemia; cold preservation solution; recipient age, sex, laboratory MELD, and transplant indication; and liver transplant centre volume.

Baseline categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test and continuous variables using ANOVA with rank-transformed data for both raw and IPTW-adjusted analyses.

Raw and IPTW-adjusted logistic and Cox regression models were used to estimate risks: odds ratio (OR), and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CIs for binary and time-to-event variables, respectively.

Covariate balance was assessed using the standardised difference, which is the difference between groups divided by the pooled standard deviation, with a goal-to-achieve value <0.15.

Statistical significance was defined as p <0.05.

Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) (see ‘Supplementary CTAT Table’ in the supplemental information online).

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

During the study period, 342 potential cDCD liver donors were evaluated.

Among these, postmortem NRP was used in 152 livers (43%), with premortem femoral vessel cannulation being performed in 132 livers (87%).

SRR was performed in the remaining 190 livers (57%).

PARAGRAPH

Postmortem NRP was run for 120 min (79–136).

In total, 52 livers (34%) from cDCD donors undergoing NRP were turned down for transplantation for reasons listed in Table 1.

Only 4 livers (3%) were discarded during NRP, all because of altered hepatic transaminases.

There were 6 cases (4%) where NRP could not be run because of technical complications; in 5 cases, cold preservation was performed and the livers were recovered and ultimately transplanted.

Given the mixed nature of organ recovery, these cases have been excluded from further analysis.

Among livers undergoing immediate postmortem SRR, 73 (38%) were turned down for reasons listed in Table 1.

Ultimately, 95 cDCD liver transplants performed with postmortem NRP and 117 cDCD performed with SRR were analysed.

PARAGRAPH

Table 2 provides donor and graft characteristics.

Given that femoral cannulae were typically in place at the moment at which death was declared, functional and total warm ischaemic times were shorter by ∼3 and ∼4 min, respectively, with NRP compared with SRR.

When cannulation for NRP was performed post mortem, warm ischaemic times were longer: functional warm ischaemia was 19 min [14–24] for postmortem cannulation vs. 12 min [9–15] for premortem cannulation, and total warm ischaemia was 27 min [22–33] for postmortem cannulation vs. 18 min [13–22] for premortem cannulation (p = 0.003 for both comparisons).

In addition to total and functional warm ischaemia, the use of colloid-containing cold preservation solutions (University of Wisconsin or IGL-1 [Institut Georges Lopez, SAS, Lissieu, France]) and colloid-free histidine tryptophan ketoglutarate also differed between NRP and SRR livers, with absolute values for standardised differences of >0.5.

After IPTW analysis, all variables were well balanced, with absolute standardised differences of <0.15.

PARAGRAPH

Table 3 provides recipient- and transplant-related characteristics.

Based on a raw analysis, recipient age, sex and laboratory MELD score, and the transplant indications cirrhosis and ‘other’ were imbalanced between NRP and SRR liver recipients.

After IPTW analysis, all absolute standardised differences were <0.15.

PARAGRAPH

Median intensive care unit (ICU) stays were 4 (3–6) vs. 3 (2–6) days, respectively (p = 0.135), and overall hospital stays were 15 (12–23) vs. 17 (11–21) days, respectively (p = 0.818), in NRP vs. SRR recipients.

Table 4 details the raw and adjusted postoperative complication rates and outcomes of 212 cDCD livers that were transplanted.

No differences were found in IPTW analysis for early allograft dysfunction, primary non-function or hepatic artery thrombosis.

Results were improved among NRP livers for overall biliary complications (OR 0.14; 95% CI 0.06–0.35; p <0.001) and ITBL (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.02–0.57; p = 0.008).

Among recipients of livers recovered with SRR (13%), 15 cases of ITBL were diagnosed, at a median of 83 days (47–212).

Only 2 cases were diagnosed among the recipients of livers recovered with NRP (2%), at 88 and 212 days, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

Table 5 details the causes of graft loss, including outcomes for individual cases of ITBL.

In addition to 11 cases of ITBL in the SRR group that ended in graft loss, there were an additional 4 with ITBL that were alive with their original grafts at the end of follow-up, with follow-ups ranging from 13 to 51 months.

There was significantly less graft loss (HR 0.39; 95% CI 0.20–0.78; p = 0.008), and fewer retransplantations among recipients of NRP livers during follow-up (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.07–0.78; p = 0.018).

With a median follow-up of 20 months, 1- and 3-year survival rates were both 93% for NRP recipients vs. 88% and 84% for SRR recipients, respectively, and both were 88% for NRP grafts vs. 83% and 76%, respectively, for SRR grafts (Fig. 1).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

This is the largest study published to date describing the use of postmortem NRP in cDCD liver transplantation and the first to suggest that the application of NRP reduces postoperative biliary strictures and ITBL and improves graft survival compared with SRR.

At 1 year, rates of overall biliary complications, graft loss and patient death for those receiving cDCD livers with NRP were 8%, 12% and 7%, respectively.

These were achieved despite a high median donor age of 57 years.

Recently published benchmarks have established ≤28% biliary complications, ≤11% graft loss, and ≤9% patient death as the goals for standard DBD liver transplantation in high-volume centres.20

The fact that this was an initial experience and that results did not vary according to centre volume support the reproducibility of these findings.

PARAGRAPH

There are a few publications from centres in North America and the UK describing the transplantation of cDCD livers recovered with SRR that also report relatively low rates of overall biliary strictures (17–25%) and ITBL (0–8%).

However, in those series, the donors themselves were very young, with mean or median donor ages ranging from 28 to 42 years (6, 7, 21–23).

Two reports from the Mayo Clinics in Florida, Rochester and Arizona in the USA and University Hospital Birmingham in the UK described results of cDCD liver transplants performed using grafts from older donors (>50–60 years) recovered with SRR.12,13

Rates of biliary complications in these 2 studies were similar to those we observed with SRR (overall 30–33%, ITBL 12%), as were 1-year patient and graft survival rates (∼90% and 80–87%, respectively) (Table 6).

Although older cDCD livers undergoing SRR can be used for transplantation, they present a greater risk for postoperative biliary complications.

However, the use of postmortem NRP could help neutralise this risk and return cDCD livers closer to their prearrest state of viability.

PARAGRAPH

When NRP is used, the period of warm ischaemia arising between ventilator withdrawal and the initiation of NRP is, at most, slightly longer than a period of hepatic inflow occlusion, which is frequently used in hepatic surgery.

Intermittent hepatic inflow occlusion is well tolerated in this context and has even been used to achieve advantageous effects in human liver transplantation.24

Benefits of postmortem NRP have been characterised in experimental studies and have been shown to include restoration of cellular energy substrates, reduction in nucleotide degradation products and improved concentrations of endogenous antioxidants before graft recovery.25

It has been shown that, by blocking the A2 receptors of adenosine, the beneficial effects of NRP are abolished, indicating that NRP mediates its effects, at least in part, through adenosine.26

Postischaemic NRP might also be useful to reduce the vasoconstrictive effects of cold graft washout with the static cold storage (SCS) solution.27

PARAGRAPH

Considering the limitations of SCS in preserving the viability of liver grafts, especially those arising through the DCD process, the past decade has seen an incremental rise in the popularity of ex situ machine perfusion preservation.

The limited clinical evidence available to date, most of which comes from low-level studies, suggests that machine perfusion offers advantages over SCS in the preservation of livers arising through the cDCD process.28–32

Recently, the results of an international randomised trial were published comparing outcomes between liver transplants performed with ex situ normothermic machine perfusion (NMP, n = 121) and SCS (n = 101).

Controlled DCD donors were included in the study at rates of 28% and 21% among grafts undergoing NMP and SCS, respectively.

The major finding of the study was a significant reduction in peak aspartate aminotransferase among NMP vs. SCS livers during the first postoperative week.

Both post-transplantation patient and graft survival rates were similar.

In terms of postoperative biliary complications, ITBL were detected at rates of 11% and 26% among cDCD livers undergoing NMP and SCS, respectively, whereas anastomotic biliary strictures were detected at rates of 48% and 58%, respectively.33

Although NMP appears to offer promise in reducing hepatic ischaemia-reperfusion injury, it is unclear that its use can help reduce postoperative biliary complications or graft loss among cDCD livers.

PARAGRAPH

In addition to being financially costly, machine perfusion preservation can also be an arduous and technically complex undertaking.

Dissection, cannulation and haemostasis need to be meticulous to avoid vascular injury that would complicate, if not altogether preclude, subsequent transplantation as well as loss of volume during perfusion in a closed circuit.29,30,33

In addition, inadequate inflow and oxygen delivery, because of loss of volume of perfusate, haemolysis, or inflow and/or outflow obstruction, result in warm ischaemia at normothermic temperatures, provoking injury that might ultimately lead to inadvertent graft loss.30,33

At least in the context of cDCD, a period of postmortem NRP is an economically favourable option that can help reduce, if not obviate, the need for machine perfusion.

PARAGRAPH

There are ethical concerns surrounding the use of NRP that might limit its widespread application in cDCD.

Whereas cardiocirculatory arrest in uDCD has been proven irreversible through the futility of advanced life support manoeuvres performed over an extended period of time, the ability to declare death based on cardiocirculatory criteria in cDCD is predicated upon a condition of permanence.

Permanence refers to the fact that, although cardiocirculatory arrest might not be irreversible, it will inevitably become so and, furthermore, lead to irreversible loss of brain and brain stem function (brain death) because circulation will not be restored.

Concern has been raised that partially restoring circulation through the use of NRP might negate this permanence and the condition of death.

Through the use of NRP, circulation is only restored to a limited region of the body, and a crucial aspect of NRP in cDCD is ensuring a lack of flow to the aortic arch vessels, thereby maintaining the permanence of circulatory arrest in the brain and brainstem.

With premortem cannulation, positioning of the aortic occlusion balloon in the supradiaphragmatic aorta distal to the left subclavian artery is confirmed radiographically before the withdrawal of care.

Once NRP is initiated, adequate occlusion is confirmed through the use of a left radial artery catheter demonstrating absence of flow.

Regions and countries where premortem manoeuvres, such as the administration of heparin and femoral vessel cannulation, are prohibited by law might consider postmortem cannulation to establish NRP.

Although total and functional warm ischaemic times were longer by ∼9 and 7 min, respectively, the results we observed with NRP with postmortem cannulation were no different from those achieved with NRP with premortem cannulation (91% 1-year graft survival and no biliary complications).

PARAGRAPH

There are limitations to the present study related to its observational nature and the non-random distribution of potential cDCD donors and livers between the 2 recovery methods.

Although the raw differences in functional and total warm ischaemic times were marginally but statistically different between the 2 recovery methods, these differences are in fact inherent to the procedures themselves and because cannulation is typically performed premortem when NRP is used.

Warm ischaemic times were longer when cannulation for NRP was performed post mortem, yet we did not detect any differences in outcomes when this approach was used, indicating that the relevant variable was the use of NRP and not warm ischaemia per se.

In addition, there were significant variations in the cold solutions used to preserve the livers in each group.

Given that cold ischaemic times in this study were rather short (in general, <6 h), the specific solution used in each case might not be as relevant.

Nevertheless, IPTW analysis was applied to address these and other differences, and the adjusted analyses continue to support the raw and unadjusted findings.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, the results of this study provide the first indication that the use of postmortem NRP in cDCD liver transplantation can help achieve improved outcomes over the use of SRR.

Livers from a broader range of cDCD donors than have been used previously can be successfully transplanted, with post-transplant results that can meet current benchmarks for standard deceased donor liver transplantation.
