TITLE

Hip fracture risk in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis: A population-based study using English and Danish data

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

An important and often studied complication of chronic liver disease is osteoporosis.1–5

Osteoporosis may be asymptomatic, but increases the risk that minor accidents result in bone fractures, particularly of the distal radius and proximal femur.1,2

Hip fractures in particular have a significant impact on health, productivity and life expectancy,6,7 and the 30-day mortality is estimated to be up to 10%.8,9

Specifically in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, the risk of these fractures may be further increased by the direct effect of high levels of alcohol use,10 or minimal hepatic encephalopathy.11

However, owing to a dearth of studies that have actually quantified the incidence of fractures in chronic liver disease, the absolute risk of hip fractures in people with alcoholic cirrhosis is unknown.

PARAGRAPH

Available estimates on the occurrence of fractures in hepatic disorders originate from small studies on heterogenous populations that were carried out almost 10 years ago.

Only two recent studies have addressed the risk of fractures in alcoholic liver disease specifically,5,12 but – like previous studies13,14 – they studied relative risks, not absolute risks and did not do a comprehensive analysis by fracture type, so estimates of hip fractures are unavailable.

Clinical practitioners and policy makers would be better placed to inform and guide patients regarding prevention strategies if their actual risk of serious injury, such as hip fracture, was known.

Indeed, while the relative risk of a hip fracture is useful in terms of identifying a group in which targeted intervention could be valuable, without absolute risks it is impossible to judge the risks and benefits of potential interventions.

When quantifying risk in a cirrhotic population it is also crucial to consider the fact that mortality is high in these patients.15,16

Only by accounting for this competing risk and demonstrating the cumulative risk of hip fracture can we accurately quantify the problem.

Therefore, we have performed a large study using two national cohorts in England and Denmark to examine the absolute and relative risk of incident hip fracture in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis compared with the general population, and to compare and contrast our findings given the differences in the populations of the two countries.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Data sources

PARAGRAPH

English data was obtained from the linked Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database,17,18 while Danish data was obtained from The Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR)19 and the Danish Civil Registration System.20

SECTION

Clinical practice research Datalink and hospital episode statistics

PARAGRAPH

The CPRD consists of computerised general practice records for over 15 million patients in the UK of which 4.4 million are active, alive and currently registered.

With a coverage of 4.4 million, it covers approximately 6% of the UK population.

Recorded data includes patient demography, diagnoses and test results entered during general practice appointments or following communication from secondary care.

These data are coded electronically using the hierarchical Read coding system21 and are subjected to regular data quality checks and audits to ensure 95% inclusion of prescribing and morbidity events.

Since 1997, the CPRD has an established linkage to the HES database, which contains information on all admissions to the state-funded National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England; including secondary care diagnoses coded using ICD-10.

Approval for use of this linked data for this study was given by the Scientific and Ethical Committee of the CPRD (15_073RAR).

SECTION

Danish National Patient Registry

PARAGRAPH

The DNPR is a nationwide registry that holds data on all admissions to non-psychiatric hospitals since 1977 and from outpatient and emergency room visits since 1995 in Denmark.

The data includes dates and diagnoses coded in accordance with the ICD-10 from 1994 and ICD-8 before that.

The Danish Central Office of Civil Registration (CPR) monitors the vital status of all Danish citizens (population 5.6 million) continuously and issues a unique personal identifier to everyone at birth or migration to Denmark.

This number enables individual-level linkage with the NPR.

SECTION

Study population

PARAGRAPH

All adults (>18 years) with a first-time diagnosis of alcoholic cirrhosis between 1997 and 2014 were identified.

Alcoholic cirrhosis was defined by the presence of a diagnostic code (Read or ICD-10 code) for alcoholic cirrhosis.

Our code lists were adapted from previously validated definitions.22,23

We defined the ’index date’ of each patient as the first date of a recorded diagnostic code for alcoholic cirrhosis.

Among the patients identified within the English data, we excluded those with an index date within one year of registration with a general practice in order to avoid prevalent cases.

For each included patient, we identified up to 10 general population controls frequency-matched on sex, age (within five years) and by registration at the same general practice, (general practice matching was for patients identified in England only).

The matched controls had to be alive and without a diagnostic or therapeutic code for cirrhosis, oesophageal varices and/or portal hypertension within their own general practice or hospital record.

PARAGRAPH

Controls identified for the English cohort were assigned an index date, which was a randomly generated date from one year after the start of the linked dataset (1997) up to the date they left their general practice or died.

For the Danish cohort, controls were assigned the same index date as the cirrhosis patient they were matched to.

Patients with a diagnosis of a hip fracture (as defined below) before the index date were excluded from both cohorts.

SECTION

Study period

PARAGRAPH

Each patient and control were followed from the index date to a diagnosis for a hip fracture, date of death, date of moving out of their general practice (for English data only), or end of follow-up (31/12/2014).

SECTION

Study definitions

SECTION

Primary outcome

PARAGRAPH

The primary outcome was time to first diagnosis for any hip fracture (ICD-10 S720-S729; Read codes 820 A, 820B, 8210, S30.

.00, S30.

.11, S302.00, S30y.00, S30y.11, S30z.00) as recorded on the general practice, hospital, or patient registry records.24

SECTION

Severity of cirrhosis

PARAGRAPH

Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were classified as being in a compensated or decompensated disease state according to the Baveno IV clinical staging classification that takes into account the absence or presence of variceal bleed, and ascites (but specifically does not include hepatic encephalopathy).25

Variceal bleed or ascites were defined if there was a relevant diagnostic code (ICD-10 code: R18, I850, K920, K921, K922, I859, I864, I982) or procedure code (OPCS4 code: T461, T462, G104, G108, G109, G144, G174, G437) up to one year before the date of diagnosis of alcoholic cirrhosis; cirrhosis patients without such codes were defined as having compensated disease.

We specifically identified evidence of hepatic encephalopathy by searching patient records for relevant diagnostic codes (ICD 10: E51.2, G31.2, K70.4, K72.1).

SECTION

Other cirrhosis aetiologies

PARAGRAPH

We reported whether our patients with alcoholic cirrhosis also had cirrhosis of other aetiology including viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease (primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and autoimmune hepatitis), haemochromatosis, Wilson’s disease and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency at any time prior to alcoholic cirrhosis diagnosis using methods described previously.22

SECTION

Comorbidity

PARAGRAPH

For each cirrhosis patient and population control, we used secondary care data recorded within two years before the index date to compute their Charlson comorbidity index (CCI).26

The CCI is a weighted comorbidity score that is defined for use in the ICD-10.

It includes myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, mild liver disease, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, rheumatic disease, peptic ulcer, diabetes with or without complications, hemiplegia or paraplegia, renal disease, moderate or severe liver disease, cancer, metastatic cancer, and HIV/AIDS.

Diagnoses related to liver disease were excluded when calculating the CCI for this study.

For clarity of presentation, we summarized the CCI into three categories: no comorbidity (CCI = 0), moderate comorbidity (CCI = 1), and multiple or severe comorbidity (CCI ≥2).

SECTION

Potential confounders

PARAGRAPH

We extracted data on patients with an osteoporosis diagnosis.

In addition, where available, we extracted data on drug exposure to oral and injected steroids, antidepressants, opiates and bisphosphonates.

These drugs were chosen because they have been previously shown to be associated with fracture or are used as a treatment for osteoporosis.27

A density parameter for each subject was defined as the number of prescriptions received (with a maximum of one prescription per day per drug category permitted) per follow-up time as defined below.

This prescription density was then categorised, for each drug category, into none, some and many of the specific prescriptions.

The categorisation of some and many was made, for each drug, as ‘less than or equal to’ or ‘greater than’ the median density of prescriptions (having excluded those with zero prescriptions).

SECTION

Statistical analyses

PARAGRAPH

We calculated the rate of first hip fracture in alcoholic cirrhosis patients and population controls.

Using Cox regression, we estimated the hazard ratio (HR) for a hip fracture in the alcoholic cirrhosis cohort compared with the control population.

All standard Cox regression models were a priori adjusted for age, sex and comorbidity at baseline (CCI, 0,1 or 2).

We computed HRs for subgroups defined by age group, sex and cirrhosis severity (compensated or decompensated cirrhosis) and examined effect modification by age with the likelihood ratio test and graphically using a Schoenfeld residuals plot.

We computed the one- and five- year cumulative risk of a hip fracture after alcoholic cirrhosis diagnosis using the cumulative incidence function with death without hip fracture as the competing risk (using age as the timescale).

Proportional hazards assumptions were confirmed using Schoenfeld residuals and log-log plots.

Finally, we identified all deaths occurring within 30 days after hip fracture diagnosis and estimated 30-day mortality and mortality risk for cirrhosis patients vs. the control population.

SECTION

Additional analyses

PARAGRAPH

We repeated our analyses on disease severity to include patients who had a clinical diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy in the decompensated group.

This enabled us to examine the effect of hepatic encephalopathy on the association between disease severity and fracture rates.

We also stratified fracture estimates by the presence or absence of osteoporosis and bisphosphonate use, as these are on the causal pathway between cirrhosis and fractures and adjusting for them in our models would have been inappropriate.

We assessed the effect of drug exposure using English data where prescription records are available.

Drug exposure (oral and injected steroids, antidepressants, opiates) was modelled as a categorical variable and included in the a priori adjusted Cox regression model if it conferred a 10% adjustment in the HRs seen (Tables S1 and S2).

Finally, to examine the role of comorbidity on fracture rates, we re-estimated the five-year cumulative incidence of fracture in only those patients with a of 0 (Fig. S1) i.e. no recorded comorbidity.

All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 13.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

Results

SECTION

Demographic and clinical characteristics

PARAGRAPH

In the English data, we included 3,706 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and 36,859 matched population controls.

The median age at diagnosis was 56 years, 68.0% of patients were men, and 49.8% had decompensated cirrhosis at their diagnosis.

At inclusion, patients with cirrhosis had more comorbidity than population controls and the prevalence of a CCI score of 1 or more was 37.7% in patients with cirrhosis and 7.1% in population controls (Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

In the Danish data, we included 17,779 patients with cirrhosis and 80,815 population controls.

They were slightly older than the English cirrhosis patients (median age 57 years), but their gender composition was similar to English cirrhosis patients (66.8% were men).

The prevalence of decompensated cirrhosis at the diagnosis for cirrhosis was 30% and Danish cirrhosis patients also had more comorbidity than population controls; the prevalence of a CCI score of 1 or more was 36.6% in cirrhosis patients and 5.4% in population controls (Table 1).

In both England and Denmark, the majority of patients (English [88.8%] and Danish [94.6%]) had an alcohol-only cirrhosis aetiology (taking into account medical records before alcoholic cirrhosis diagnosis).

Evidence of osteoporosis was found in 6.3% and 3.1% of English and Danish patients, respectively.

SECTION

Fracture analysis

PARAGRAPH

We followed up the English population for a total of 177,717 person years, during which 485 hip fractures occurred (108 fractures in cirrhosis patients, 377 fractures in controls).

The absolute hip fracture rate for patients with cirrhosis was 11.4 fractures (95% CI 9.4–13.8) per 1,000 person years but the rate among controls was much lower at 2.2 (95% CI 2.0–2.5) per 1,000 person years (Table 2).

In effect, there was an excess of 9.2 fractures per 1,000 person years in English cirrhosis patients.

The adjusted hip fracture HR for cirrhosis patients vs. controls was 5.5 (95% CI 4.3–6.9) (Table 2).

PARAGRAPH

The corresponding numbers for the Danish population were 753,797 person years of follow-up and 2,491 fractures (977 fractures in cirrhosis patients and 1,514 fractures in controls).

Similarly, the absolute hip fracture rate for Danish cirrhosis patients was higher than that of controls, at 16.0 (95% CI 15.0–17.0) per 1,000 person years compared to 2.2 (95% CI 2.1–2.3) per 1,000 person years (Table 2).

Thus, there was an excess of 13.8 fractures per 1,000 person years in Danish cirrhosis patients over controls.

The adjusted hip fracture HR for Danish cirrhosis patients vs. controls was 8.5 (95% CI 7.8–9.3).

SECTION

Fracture rate analysis by subgroups

PARAGRAPH

In both countries the association between cirrhosis and hip fracture rate was stronger in younger age groups (aged <45 years) than in older age (p value for interaction with age <0.001).

The HR of a hip fracture in those aged 45–54 years was 14.7 (95% CI 8.6–24.9) and 13.1 (95% CI 10.9–15.7) in England and Denmark respectively, whereas for those aged 75 years and over it was 2.1 (95% CI 1.1–3.9) (England) and 3.0 (95% CI 2.1–4.2) (Denmark) (Table 2 and Fig. 1).

In Denmark, the association between cirrhosis and hip fracture rate was slightly stronger in men (HR 9.0; 95% CI 8.0–10.1) than in women (HR 7.9; 95% CI 6.9–9.0) but in England it was stronger in women (HR 7.1; 95% CI 5.0–9.9) than in men (HR 4.4; 95% CI 3.2–6.1).

Disease severity had no remarkable effect on absolute fracture rate in Demark, but in England, absolute fracture rates were higher in patients with decompensated disease than in compensated disease (14.2 vs. 9.4 per 1,000 person years).

Including hepatic encephalopathy in the definition of disease severity had a minimal effect on the association between disease severity and fracture rates.

SECTION

One-year and five-year cumulative incidence analysis

PARAGRAPH

After one-year of follow-up, the cumulative hip fracture risk in English cirrhosis patients was 1.0% (95% CI 0.7–1.4) compared to 0.2% (95% CI 0.1–0.3) for population controls.

The corresponding five-year risks were also higher for cirrhosis patients than for controls at 2.9% (95% CI 2.3–3.6) vs. 0.8% (95% CI 0.7–0.9).

Likewise, in the Danish cohort, the one-year hip fracture risk for cirrhosis patients was higher than that of controls at 1.4% (95% CI 1.2–1.6) vs. 0.2% (95% CI 0.1–0.2).

The corresponding five-year risks were 4.6% (95% CI 4.3–5.0) and 0.9% (95% CI 0.8–0.9) respectively.

PARAGRAPH

In both countries, the five-year risks of hip fracture increased with increasing age and were higher for each cirrhosis age group than for the matched controls (Fig. 2, Table 3).

The cumulative risk among the young controls (less than 45 years) was very low, but the risk in young cirrhosis patients was remarkably high, hence the increase in risk relative to the control population was greater in younger cirrhosis patients than in those over 75 years (Fig. 2).

We found no variation in hip fracture risk by disease severity (Table 3).

SECTION

30-day mortality estimate

PARAGRAPH

By 30 days post hip fracture, 11.1% (12/108) of English patients with cirrhosis and 10.0% (98/977) of Danish patients with cirrhosis had died compared to 5.0% (England) and 6.6% (Denmark) for the control populations (Table 4).

The adjusted mortality risk ratio comparing deaths in cirrhosis patients to controls was 2.8 (95% CI 1.9–3.9) and 2.0 (95% CI 1.5–2.7) for England and Denmark, respectively.

SECTION

Additional analyses on drug use

PARAGRAPH

Information on drug usage for the English cirrhosis and control cohorts is provided (Table S1).

Patients with cirrhosis were more likely than controls to have had a prescription of opiates (42.2% vs. 32.7%) and antidepressants (14.2% vs. 11.1%), but as likely to have had a prescription for oral or injected corticosteroids (13.9% vs. 14.7%).

As shown, there was only minimal confounding identified following adjustment for prescription drug use (Table S2).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Using data from two national cohorts, we have shown an increased rate of hip fracture for people with alcoholic cirrhosis of between fivefold to nearly ninefold compared with the general population.

The five-year risk of hip fracture was 2.9% for cirrhosis patients in the England and 4.6% for patients in Denmark.

In both countries, younger patients had the largest risk difference when comparing cirrhosis patients with controls.

This association was due to the combination of a very low risk of hip fractures among young control patients and the contrasting high risk in young patients with alcoholic cirrhosis.

We found a higher 30-day post-fracture mortality in cirrhosis patients of between two- to threefold compared to population controls.

Our study therefore indicates that interventions to prevent hip fracture in this population could have a significant benefit.

PARAGRAPH

We chose to combine two national cohorts for this analysis so that we could compare and contrast our findings and explore some of the differences.

There were many similarities between the alcoholic cirrhosis cohorts in both countries.

The age and sex profiles were very similar, and the relative risks of fracture were ALSO reasonably similar.

Importantly, the interaction with age showed the same pattern of relative and cumulative risks in both countries indicating its likely veracity.

Our conclusions were the same irrespective of the severity of alcoholic cirrhosis suggesting that the 20% difference in the prevalence of decompensation between both cohorts was not crucial to the interpretation of our analysis.

SECTION

Strengths and limitations

PARAGRAPH

This is the first study to report the incidence of hip fracture in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis using prospectively collected data from two large national cohorts, with access to a suitable control population.

Other strengths are its large size, competing risk adjustment, and population-based setting which means we have been able to estimate both the absolute and relative risks of hip fractures with reasonable precision and accuracy, and that these estimates are generalizable to the general populations of the two nations and possibly given the similarity between the results, to others as well.

In addition, we were able to stratify estimates by age and sex, and in so doing have accounted for variation by these variables.

Information on some other potential confounding factors28,29 were either missing for some patients or absent in totality, e.g. weight bearing exercise, meaning that we could not assess their potential effect on our estimates.

Our estimates were also not adjusted for alcohol use because heavy alcohol intake is an inherent part of having alcoholic cirrhosis and it would therefore be inappropriate to adjust for.

Obviously, this means we do not know how much alcoholic individuals drank post-cirrhosis diagnosis nor how this might alter to their fracture risk.

However, the presence of an increased risk of fracture in non-alcoholic groups with liver injury4 argues that alcohol cannot entirely account for the relationship shown in our study.

PARAGRAPH

The data sources used for this study have previously been validated and quality assured both for the diagnosis of cirrhosis23,30 and for hip fracture.31,32

A validation of the severity of disease, as measured through decompensation, has not however been possible and as such, we may have misclassified some patients between stages of disease.

Nevertheless, our previous work33 has shown that the Baveno method of classifying decompensation accurately predicts mortality and as such appears a reasonably sound approach.

Finally, while these results have important implications for fracture prevention in people with cirrhosis, this analysis does not consider the mechanism of fractures, thus it is not possible to explicitly attribute the increased risk of fractures to, for example, osteoporosis, trauma, both or some other risk factors.

Although we found 6.3% (England) and 3.1% (Denmark) of patients with evidence of osteoporosis, these should be interpreted with caution as recording of osteoporosis diagnosis within our data is presumed to be incomplete and therefore underestimated.

Future studies may consider exploring the prevalence of osteoporosis in alcoholic cirrhosis in more detail, given this lack of robust osteoporosis data in our study.

SECTION

Comparison with previous literature

PARAGRAPH

Previous publications on the association between osteoporosis, fractures and alcoholic liver disease have been with small heterogenous populations and thus far, only relative risks have been presented.

In 2014, Bang et al. reported a relative fracture risk in people with alcoholic cirrhosis of 2.4, but this was based on a small subgroup of patients identified within a larger cohort of patients with either chronic pancreatitis or cirrhosis.5

In another meta-analysis from the same group in 2015, based on six studies,34–39 a lower relative increase in fracture risk of 1.9 was found among people with alcoholic liver disease of mixed severity.12

Several other data for comparison originate from studies based on other chronic liver diseases.

Tsai et al., estimated the risk of fractures in 3,764 patients with cirrhosis (most likely to be predominantly hepatitis-B related) compared to non-cirrhotic controls, and found a fourfold increase in skull fracture risk in cirrhosis patients with hepatic encephalopathy, and a 1.6- to 1.8-fold increase in spine, trunk and upper limb fracture risk in cirrhosis patients without hepatic encephalopathy.40

In two other studies using the same UK primary care database as our study, high relative increases in hip and wrist fracture rates of between 1.9 and 4.0 were found in patients with primary biliary cholangitis or any chronic liver disease.4,14

PARAGRAPH

In our analysis accounting for death as a competing risk, we found no difference in the cumulative risk of fractures between patients with compensated and decompensated disease.

These findings are consistent with two smaller studies on other advanced liver disease (primary biliary cholangitis) which found no association between the occurrence of fractures and severity of liver disease.4,41

SECTION

Clinical implications and conclusion

PARAGRAPH

Overall, our study has shown that hip fracture is an important clinical outcome in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis due to its frequent occurrence and severe consequence.

The cumulative risk of fracture, having accounted for the competing risk of death, in these patients is approximately 1% per annum and there is more than twofold higher post-fracture 30-day mortality in people with cirrhosis than in the general population.

Currently, great emphasis is placed on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as an important, potentially preventable, cause of mortality in cirrhosis with several guidelines proposing national HCC surveillance to enhance detection and thus early treatment.42,43

Given that our study has shown that the cumulative incidence of hip fractures in alcoholic cirrhosis is higher than that of HCC,15,44 hip fractures may be an even more important cause of death and morbidity among people with alcoholic cirrhosis.

To these facts can be added the knowledge that effective pharmacotherapy exists to treat osteoporosis and is proven to reduce hip fracture risk.45–48

PARAGRAPH

Therefore, prophylaxis to reduce hip fracture occurrence in people with alcoholic cirrhosis,48–51 may have greater potential for benefit than does the currently common practice of surveillance for HCC, and certainly warrants consideration alongside it.
