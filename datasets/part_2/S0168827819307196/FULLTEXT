TITLE

High incidence of HCV in HIV-negative men who have sex with men using pre-exposure prophylaxis

SECTION

INTRODUCTION

PARAGRAPH

The majority of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections worldwide are transmitted via injection drug use (IDU).1

Since the early 2000s, however, HCV has emerged as a sexually transmitted infection (STI) among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM).2,3

Sexual transmission of HCV among HIV-positive MSM has been associated with receptive condomless anal sex (CAS), recent (ulcerative) sexually transmitted infection (STI), sharing of sex toys, sexual techniques damaging the anorectal mucosa (i.e. fisting), and use of recreational drugs before or during sex.4

It has been hypothesized that HIV-negative MSM have remained largely unaffected by HCV5-8 due to (1) lower biological susceptibility to HCV compared to those with HIV-infection as a result of more efficient immunological responses in the gastrointestinal mucosa when small HCV inoculums are present in semen9,10, (2) engaging in sex with partners of the same HIV-status (“serosorting”) where HCV-prevalence among HIV-negative MSM is low, and (3) lower sexual transmissibility of HCV compared to HIV, hence explaining why HIV-infection often precedes HCV-infection.10-12

Increased uptake of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which successfully prevents HIV-infection but not HCV-infection, could usher increasing overlap in sexual networks between HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM, eventually resulting in an expanding HCV epidemic among MSM irrespective of HIV-status.

Indeed, sero-discordant CAS has increased among HIV-negative MSM since 2005.13

PARAGRAPH

We previously reported an HCV-prevalence of almost 5% among HIV-negative MSM who started PrEP in Amsterdam.12

We aimed to determine whether this elevated risk carried over during the first two years of PrEP-use among MSM in Amsterdam.

We assessed HCV-incidence over time, both overall and according to primary/re-infection or by PrEP regimen (daily/event-driven), while examining its associated risk-factors.

We also evaluated whether strains of incident HCV infections in HIV-negative MSM clustered with strains from HIV-positive MSM and other HCV risk groups in the Netherlands.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

SECTION

Study population and design

PARAGRAPH

The Amsterdam PrEP (AMPrEP) study is a demonstration project conducted at the Public Health Service of Amsterdam with the aim of assessing uptake and acceptability of daily and event-driven PrEP.

Study design and procedures have been described previously.14

All participants provided written informed consent.

The study was approved by the institutional ethics board.

Inclusion took place from 3 August 2015 to 31 May 2016 and follow-up is ongoing.

PARAGRAPH

Eligible participants were offered a choice of daily or event-driven PrEP and were given the opportunity to switch PrEP regimens at each study visit.15

We monitored participants at 3-month visits.

Participant characteristics were collected every 3 months (sexual behaviour) or 6 months (behavioural risk-factors for HCV-infection) through computer-assisted self-reported questionnaires.14,16

Blood samples from each 3-month visit were collected and stored.

STI-testing was performed at 3-month study visits and additionally in case of partner notification or clinical indications in between visits.17

PARAGRAPH

We restricted our analyses to participants with at least two HCV-test results.

SECTION

HCV-testing procedures

PARAGRAPH

HCV-testing initially occurred every 12 months and from December 2016 every 6 months (based on analyses demonstrating high baseline HCV prevalence).12

Additional HCV-testing was performed in the event of partner notification or clinical indication.

HCV-RNA positive participants were referred for further evaluation and treatment, and were counseled on prevention of HCV re-infection.

PARAGRAPH

At inclusion, participants were tested for HCV-RNA (COBAS Taqscreen MPX v2.0, Roche Diagnostics) and HCV antibodies (ARCHITECT anti-HCV, Abbott Laboratories) and if antibody-positive, immunoblot confirmation (INNO-LIA HIV I/II and HCV Score, Fujirebio).12

During follow-up, participants without detectable HCV antibodies at the previous visit were tested for HCV antibodies (Liaison XL HCV-Ab, DiaSorin).

Participants with a previous HCV antibody-positive test result and HCV-naïve participants with newly detected HCV antibodies were tested for HCV-RNA using a validated in-house HCV PCR targeting the 5’ non-coding region.18,19

Earlier samples (HCV was tested every six months but samples were stored every three months) from participants diagnosed with a new HCV (re-)infection were retrospectively tested for HCV-RNA and/or HCV-antibodies to identify the first positive test (Supplementary figure 1).

SECTION

Genotyping and phylogenetic analysis

PARAGRAPH

HCV-RNA isolation, reverse transcription, amplification and sequencing were performed as described previously.12

In short, we used isolated HCV-RNA obtained from 400 μl of plasma as input for two separate PCR assays targeting the NS5B region, resulting in the amplification of two overlapping NS5B fragments.

Fragment 1 (nucleotides 8001-8340) and fragment 2 (nucleotides 8228-8709) together form an NS5B fragment with a total length of 709 nucleotides (nt 8001-8709).

Phylogenetic trees were built for each HCV subtype separately containing HCV sequences from (i) HIV-negative AMPrEP participants with prevalent and/or incident HCV-infection (n=29), (ii) HIV-positive MSM acquiring HCV after 2010 obtained from three HIV treatment centers in Amsterdam (n=137), (iii) HCV-RNA positive Dutch blood donors in 1997-2018 (n=84), and (iv) all additional Dutch HCV NS5B sequences in Genbank [mainly from people who inject drugs (PWID) and HIV-positive MSM diagnosed with HCV before 2010] (n=198).

Maximum-likelihood phylogenies were constructed using a general time-reversed substitution model with γ-distribution, assuming a certain fraction of evolutionary invariable sites (GTR+G+I) in Mega v6.0.

Bootstrapping (n=500) was used to analyze the stability of tree topology (bootstrap values >70 represent robust clusters).

HCV NS5B sequences from AMPrEP participants were submitted to GenBank (baseline infections: KY386877-KY386891; incident infections: MK616411-MK616424).

SECTION

Outcomes

PARAGRAPH

Primary HCV-infection, re-infection and possible re-infection, were defined according to the recommendations from the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) (Supplementary table 1).20

The date of infection was estimated by calculating the mid-point between last negative and first positive HCV-RNA test date.

The estimated date of infection for HCV-RNA positive participants without detectable HCV antibodies was determined as 28 days prior, which is equivalent to half of the mean HCV-seroconversion time.21

PARAGRAPH

A cured infection was defined as a sustained virological response (SVR) ≥12 weeks after the end of treatment.

Spontaneously resolved infections were categorized as (i) proven: no HCV-treatment and having two HCV-RNA negative test results within a ≥24-week time-interval20 or (ii) possible: no HCV-treatment and having one HCV-RNA negative test result, or having two HCV-RNA negative test results <24 weeks apart.

SECTION

Risk-factors

PARAGRAPH

We evaluated the following risk-factors for incident HCV-infection: age; ethnicity (white versus non-white); PrEP regimen (daily versus event-driven); in the past 3 months: number of receptive CAS acts with casual partner(s), having had anal sex with an HIV-positive partner; in the past 6 months: sharing of sex toys, fisting without gloves, engaging in chemsex; in the past year: sharing straws when snorting drugs, IDU; and at study visit: diagnosed anal chlamydia and/or gonorrhea infections (termed herein as “recent anal STI”), diagnosed syphilis.

We defined chemsex as self-reported use of methamphetamine, γ-hydroxybutyric acid(GHB)/γ-butyrolactone(GBL) and/or mephedrone during sex.22

PARAGRAPH

All covariates except ethnicity were time-updated.

Missing data due to questions not being asked every three months were imputed from the subsequent visit with available data.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Follow-up began at enrolment for HCV-naïve participants or after successful treatment or spontaneous clearance for those with a prevalent HCVinfection at enrolment, and ended at HIV-seroconversion, definite PrEP-discontinuation, 2-year visit, or last study visit before 30 September 2018, whichever occurred first.

PARAGRAPH

We calculated overall, primary infection (among anti-HCV negative participants), and re-infection IRs (among participants who had been cured or spontaneously cleared HCV-infection).

PARAGRAPH

For all calculations, follow-up included gaps during which PrEP-use was temporarily discontinued and if incident HCV-infection occurred, follow-up was allowed to continue after end of successful treatment or spontaneous clearance.

PARAGRAPH

In risk-factor analysis, we expected that the few observed outcomes would lead to uncertain and exaggerated parameter estimates from standard regression techniques, which could result in incorrectly detecting a risk-factor.23

To minimize this bias, we used a “penalized” regression approach whereby uncertain estimates from the data are pulled towards more realistic ones assumed from prior knowledge.24

PARAGRAPH

Briefly, we fit univariable exponential survival models for each covariate separately using a Bayesian approach.

For each risk-factor, we first specify a prior distribution of hazards ratios (HRs) based on the most “plausible range” from both previous research and clinical observations.25

These priors were selected on the basis of risk-factors identified from studies conducted in the Netherlands and Canada (Supplementary table 2).4,12,16,26

Since the intercept of this model estimates the IR without a given risk-factor, we based the prior distribution of this parameter on the overall HCV-IR from a study among MSM PrEP-users in France, estimated at 1 per 100PY [95% credible intervals (CrI) 0.3-4.0].27

Using these priors together with the data, we estimated a posterior distribution of HRs with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods from the “bayes” prefix commands in Stata.

The median of this distribution defined the parameter estimate (termed “posterior HR”) and their 2.5% and 97.5 % quantiles defined the 95% CrI (quantifying the uncertainty in the parameter estimate).

PARAGRAPH

All statistical analysis was performed using Stata 15 (Statacorp, College Station, TX, USA).

SECTION

Sensitivity analysis

PARAGRAPH

First, we assessed IR of re-infection while not considering possible re-infections.

Second, since posterior HRs could be highly influenced by the prior distribution,28 we repeated risk-factor analysis using (1) non-informative priors (i.e. those that bear minimal influence when estimating the posterior distribution) for each covariate, and (2) a different prior for daily PrEP regimen (vs. event-driven) and anal sex with ≥1 HIV-positive partner.

Third, we restricted analyses to participants who did not report IDU in the past 12 months during follow-up visits.

Fourth, we repeated the analyses using an exponential survival model without a Bayesian approach.

RESULTS

SECTION

Study population

PARAGRAPH

Of the 376 enrolled participants, 26 did not have at least two HCV-test results and were excluded.

Of the 350 analyzed participants, 348 were MSM and 2 transgender women.

At enrolment, median age was 40 years (IQR 33-48), 298 (85.1%) self-identified as white, 261 (74.6%) lived in Amsterdam and 10 (2.9%) reported IDU within 3 months before enrolment (table 1).

Initially, 257 (73.4%) participants chose daily and 93 (26.6%) event-driven PrEP.

There were 17/350 (4.9%) participants with HCV antibodies at baseline, 15 of whom were HCV-RNA positive.

SECTION

HCV-incidence

PARAGRAPH

Median cumulative follow-up was 2.0 years (IQR 1.9-2.0), totaling 653.6 PY at risk, during which time we identified 12 incident HCV infections and three possible incident HCV infections among 14 MSM (table 2) (overall IR 2.30/100PY, Supplementary table 3).

Six of 15 infections were diagnosed among 35 participants who reported IDU at least once during follow-up (IR 10.49/100PY).

Nine infections were diagnosed among 314 participants who never reported IDU during follow-up (IR 1.51/100PY, Supplementary table 3).

HCV was not diagnosed among transgender women.

Primary infection occurred in 8 of 333 at-risk participants over 628.4 PY of follow-up (IR 1.27/100PY) and re-infection occurred in 7 of 21 at-risk participants over 25.2 PY of follow-up (IR 27.8/100PY).

When excluding the three possible re-infections, the overall and reinfection IRs were 1.84/100PY and 16.6/100PY, respectively.

No participant with incident HCV-infection acquired HIV.

PARAGRAPH

The overall IRs for daily and event-driven PrEP regimens were 2.71/100PY and 1.15/100PY, respectively (Supplementary table 3).

IRs of primary infection were 1.51/100PY in daily PrEP and 0.61/100PY in event-driven PrEP, and IRs of re-infection 41.4/100PY and 9.3/100 PY, respectively.

One person with incident HCV-infection (table 2, participant 11) was likely infected during PrEP discontinuation, while PrEP was re-continued at HCV diagnosis.

PARAGRAPH

Of the fourteen MSM with incident HCV-infection(s), thirteen had chosen daily PrEP and one event-driven PrEP at baseline.

At the estimated date of first incident HCV-infection, twelve were using daily and two event-driven PrEP.

For 7/15 incident HCV infections, HCV-RNA was detectable in stored samples 62 to 189 days prior to HCV-diagnosis.

PARAGRAPH

Of the four proven re-infections, all had been treated with direct-acting antivirals for their primary HCV-infection and had achieved SVR12.

The three possible re-infections occurred in two persons.

In these cases, we could not exclude relapse of a previous infection because the two viremic episodes were either separated by only one HCV-RNA negative visit (table 2, participant 13, first infection) or two subsequent HCV-RNA negative visits were <24 weeks apart (participant 13 [second infection] and participant 14; Supplementary table 4) without a documented switch in genotype.

SECTION

Risk-factors for incident HCV-infection

PARAGRAPH

We found that HCV-incidence was associated with increased number of receptive CAS acts with casual partners in the past 3 months (posterior HR 1.57 per ln increase, 95% CrI 1.09-2.20) and recent anal STI diagnosis (posterior HR 2.93, 95% CrI 1.24-7.13).

Higher IRs were also found among those who shared straws when snorting drugs (posterior HR 2.62, 95% CrI 1.09-6.02) and those who injected drugs in the past 12 months (posterior HR 4.69, 95% CrI 1.61-12.09) (table 3 and figure 1).

Multivariable analysis was precluded by the small numbers of events.

PARAGRAPH

Using non-informative priors resulted in CrI with increased uncertainty (Supplementary table 5), yet all identified factors for incident HCV-infection were retained with the exception of sharing straws when snorting drugs.

A stronger prior for daily PrEP regimen and for reporting sex with at least one HIV-positive partner (prior HR 2 for both) did not substantially alter posterior HRs (1.78, 95% CrI 0.95-3.32 and 2.07, 95%CrI 0.92-4.83, respectively).

HRs estimated from the non-penalized regression approach resulted in much higher HRs with larger 95% confidence intervals as expected (Supplementary table 6).

We did not identify risk factors when we restricted the analysis to participants who did not report IDU during follow-up, although all factors had similar directions of effect compared to the main analysis (Supplementary table 7).

The proportion engaging in HCV risk factors did not increase over time since initiation of PrEP (Supplementary table 8).

Number of receptive condomless anal sex acts with casual partners, proportion having had anal sex with an HIV-positive partner, having a recent anal STI and sharing sex toys were all lower in the event-driven versus daily PrEP group (Supplementary table 9).

SECTION

Hepatitis C virus genotyping and phylogenetic analysis

PARAGRAPH

Of the eight primary infections, six were subtype 1a, one 2b and one 3a.

All four proven re-infections were subtype 1a.

Of the three possible re-infections, one was subtype 4d, one 1a and one could not be genotyped.

PARAGRAPH

Figure 2 shows the maximum likelihood phylogenies of HCV-1a, HCV-2b, HCV-3a and HCV-4d, including all incident and prevalent HCV infections among AMPrEP participants together with HCV strains from HIV-positive MSM, PWID and blood donors in the Netherlands.

Phylogenetic trees revealed ten robust MSM-specific clusters of HCV-1a (n=7), HCV-2b (n=1), HCV-3a (n=1) and HCV-4d (n=1), which ranged in size from 3 to 53 sequences.

HCV sequences from HIV-negative MSM were highly interspersed with those of HIV-positive MSM: 27/29 (93.1%) strains of HIV-negative MSM were part of ten MSM-specific clusters also containing HIV-positive MSM, one formed a homologous pair with a strain from an HIV-positive MSM, and one strain from an HIV-negative MSM had a singleton sequence.

PARAGRAPH

Six of 17 participants with prevalent or resolved HCV-infection were diagnosed with a re-infection during follow-up.

Of those, two had resolved their initial infection prior to enrolment, leaving four participants for whom we could compare the primary and re-infecting HCV strain.

Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that three participants indeed had two different HCV strains over time: participant 10: HCV 1a-1 and HCV 1a-2, participant 12: HCV 1a-1 and HCV 1a-8, and participant 9: HCV 2b-1 and HCV 1a-1 (Figure 2).

Participant 14 was classified as possibly re-infected and had two viraemic episodes with two highly similar HCV 4d-1 strains separated by two HCV-RNA negative visits more than 2 months apart.

SECTION

DISCUSSION

PARAGRAPH

Among HIV-negative MSM enrolled in the Amsterdam PrEP project, we found a high incidence of HCV primary and re-infection, with a much lower IR for primary than re-infection.

Factors associated with HCV-infection were receptive CAS with casual partners, being diagnosed with an anal STI, IDU and sharing straws when snorting drugs.

Phylogenetic analyses revealed that HCV sequences of HIV-negative MSM starting or using PrEP were highly interspersed with HCV sequences from HIV-positive MSM.

PARAGRAPH

Several studies have reported small numbers of incident HCV infections among HIV-negative MSM.8,15,29-35

HCV-IRs among HIV-negative MSM on PrEP were assessed in three cohorts, with observed IRs varying from 0/100PY in Canada to 3.0/100PY in France in 2017.27,35,36

In our study, the overall HCV-IR was more comparable to the French study.

The differences in reported IRs across the different studies may be explained by variations in sexual networks and risk behaviour, geographic region, calendar time, and whether re-infections have been included in IR estimations.37

PARAGRAPH

The IRs of overall HCV infection and re-infection observed in HIV-negative MSM on PrEP are comparable to those observed in HIV-positive MSM.2,5,38-41

In contrast, HIV-negative MSM not on PrEP have a 19-fold lower HCV-incidence compared to HIV-positive MSM according to a recent meta-analysis.42

The prevalence of HCV antibody-positive serology among HIV-negative MSM in Amsterdam participating in cross-sectional surveys at our STI clinic varied between 0.0% and 1.7% and did not change from 2007-2017.43

These findings imply that there is no overflow of HCV infections observed in HIV-positive MSM and HIV-negative MSM starting or using PrEP to the larger HIV-negative MSM population, at least for the time being.

Taken together, this evidence adds to the need for routine HCV-screening among MSM if initiating or using PrEP, as well as continued surveillance of HCV infections within the broader HIV-negative MSM population.

PARAGRAPH

The reasons explaining why HIV-negative PrEP-using MSM acquire HCV may be twofold: their sexual networks are more likely to overlap with those of HIV-positive MSM, in whom HCV is more prevalent, and after initiating PrEP, the protection against HIV provided by PrEP makes the use of other prevention strategies, such as serosorting and condom use, less important.

Several studies have indeed shown decreases in condom use during the course of PrEP-use,17,44 which likely results in increased exposure to HCV and susceptibility to HCV-transmission when STI are present.3

We demonstrated that factors associated with incident HCV-infection were related to both sex (receptive CAS with casual partners and a recent anal STI) and drug use (IDU and sharing straws when snorting drugs).

These factors are largely comparable to those found in HIV-positive MSM.2,5

HCV-incidence was higher among those on daily PrEP than among those on event-driven PrEP, most likely resulting from higher levels of sexual risk behaviour in this group.

Although several HCV infections were among participants reporting IDU, the majority (9/15) of infections was not related to IDU, indicating that sexual behaviour is, next to IDU, an important target for intervention.

PARAGRAPH

Similar to our study, two studies from France have reported that HCV isolates from HIV-negative MSM, of whom the majority was using PrEP, were infected with HCV strains also found in HIV-positive MSM.31,35

Our phylogenetic analysis, using longer HCV NS5B fragments and larger subsets of HCV isolates obtained from various risk groups of both MSM and non-MSM, confirms the existence of robust MSM-specific HCV clusters.

This emphasizes the overlap between sexual networks of MSM with and without HIV.

PARAGRAPH

The major strengths of our study are that we report not only HCV-IRs but also factors associated with incident HCV-infection and phylogenetic clusters from a PrEP demonstration study.

In addition, we report HCV-IRs of MSM using daily and event-driven PrEP, which have yet to be reported by other trials or prospective cohorts.

PARAGRAPH

This study does have some limitations.

Risk-factors for HCV re-infection in MSM have not been studied extensively and all relevant risk-factors might not have been included.

We tested for HCV-RNA every 6 months and re-infections lasting shorter than this interval could have gone undiagnosed, leading to underestimated IRs.

This limitation is shared, however, with other studies reporting irregular or unclear HCV-testing frequencies frequency.8,15,27,32-34

One participant had two HCV infections with viral strains that, genetically, were highly comparable.

It remains uncertain whether he was re-infected via a related source (i.e. the same sexual partner) or had chronic HCV-infection with low intermittent viraemia.

PARAGRAPH

PrEP prevents HIV, but not HCV-infection.

Currently, sexually active MSM intending to use PrEP are recommended to be screened for HCV-infection at PrEP-initiation, while the advised testing frequency during PrEP-use varies with 3-month intervals45,46, regularly47, annually48 or even ‘consider annual testing’.49

Based on the observed incidence rate, we suggest that all MSM be tested for HCV antibodies at PrEP-initiation, followed by a minimum of 6-month testing intervals during PrEP.

More frequent testing (e.g. at 3-month intervals) for HCV-RNA should be considered for those with previous HCV-infection and those reporting HCV risk-factors.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, we demonstrate ongoing sexual transmission of HCV and high IR of primary and re-infection in a cohort of HIV-negative MSM using PrEP.

Both rates and risk-factors are comparable to those among HIV-positive MSM.

Phylogenetic analysis suggests shared sexual networks of MSM with and without HIV.

Our findings highlight the importance of an integrated sexual health approach, which includes professional education concerning HCV, frequent provider- or client-initiated testing and treatment of those with detectable HCV-RNA.

Additional preventive interventions are certainly needed, such as campaigns to inform MSM about the risks of HCV and effective behavioural interventions, particularly for those at risk of (re-)infection.
