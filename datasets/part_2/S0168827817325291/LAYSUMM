TITLE

Comparison of the accuracy of AASLD and LI-RADS criteria for the non-invasive diagnosis of HCC smaller than 3 cm

PARAGRAPH

The 2014 version of Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System criteria does not outperform the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases criteria for the non-invasive diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) smaller than 3â€¯cm.

Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System offers a nodule-based evaluation of the risk of HCC, allowing possible changes in management in these patients.

The added value of ancillary features appears limited for the non-invasive diagnosis of small HCC.
