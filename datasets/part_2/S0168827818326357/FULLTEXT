TITLE

Hepatocyte-specific suppression of microRNA-221-3p mitigates liver fibrosis

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis contribute to more than 1 million deaths per year worldwide1,2 (particularly, 170,000 per year in Europe3 and 33,539 per year in the United States4).

The underlying pathologies leading to fibrosis and subsequently cirrhosis are chronic virus infection, alcoholic steatohepatitis, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.5

The manifestation of fibrosis is accompanied by the activation of quiescent HSCs, accumulation of excessive extracellular matrix, and hepatocyte dysfunction leading to liver failure.6

While the majority of efforts have been concentrated on the elucidation of HSCs function during fibrosis, the regulatory functions of hepatocyte, the main parenchymal cells of the liver, remain to be understood further.

Specifically, how gene expression alterations, particularly at the post-transcriptional level in hepatocytes, regulate fibrosis remains to be investigated.

MiRNAs, one of the post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression,7,8 have been reported to be deregulated in liver fibrosis.7,9

The majority of studies have examined the functions of miRNAs in HSCs; however, identification and functional analysis of hepatocyte miRNAs, which are capable of regulating fibrosis, remain to be investigated.

Elucidation of such key fibrosis-regulating miRNAs in hepatocytes, an easy-to-target cell type in the liver, would allow development of successful therapeutics for liver fibrosis.

We used 8–12-week-old male BALB/c mice (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) for all in vivo studies.

Mice (5 in 1 cage) were provided free access to food and water and kept in a colony room on a 12:12-hour light and dark cycle.

All experiments, within this study, were performed according to animal protocol (TVA 17/2658), which was approved by Hannover Medical School and authorities of Lower Saxony State, Germany.

miRNA mimic library screening

PARAGRAPH

The 96-well inserts (Corning 3392, Darmstadt, Germany) were coated with 50 µg/ml collagen (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) at room temperature for 1 hour.

After discarding the collagen solution, 6,500 primary mouse hepatocytes were seeded onto each air-dried insert and were cultured with hepatocyte culture medium (HCM) overnight.

A total of 302 miRNAs, which are conserved between human and mouse, were applied for the transfection in a final concentration of 25 nM miRNA per well.

At 16 hours post transfection, the transfected primary mouse hepatocytes were placed on top of a monolayer of mHSC-Col1a1-GFP cells (7,000 cells per well) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum, 4 mM l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin for further incubation at 37 °C.

Results

SECTION

Functional miRNA screening identifies miR-221-3p as a potential fibrosis regulator

PARAGRAPH

To identify miRNAs whose modulation in primary hepatocytes is capable of regulating liver fibrosis, we undertook an miRNA screening approach, wherein we examined a fibrogenic role of 302 miRNAs.

These miRNAs represent a library of conserved miRNAs between mouse and human.

Our miRNA screening required use of a HSC line, which allows measurement of fibrosis-related markers in a high-throughput manner.

For this purpose, we used mouse HSCs, which express GFP under the transcriptional control of collagen 1 promoter/enhancer (henceforth referred to as Col-GFP HSCs).19

Thus, we first transfected primary mouse hepatocytes with individual miRNAs and subsequently co-cultured them with Col-GFP HSCs (Fig. 1A).

After 48 hours, we measured GFP intensity as surrogate readout of fibrogenesis (Fig. 1B).

The GFP intensity of co-cultured cells transfected with Scr was set as 1.

Based on this screening, we selected 15 miRNAs, which demonstrated maximum elevation in GFP intensity.

We then validated those 15 miRNAs in 3 independent co-culture experiments; 12 of 15 miRNAs showed similar results compared with those obtained from our miRNA screen.

Notably, 6 (miR-151a-5p, -374b-5p, -200b-3p, -219-2-3p, -221-3p, and -30c-1-3p) of these 12 miRNAs significantly (p <0.05) increased GFP intensity (Fig. 1C), indicating that these 6 miRNAs may promote fibrogenesis.

In addition, we found that 2 miRNAs (miR-17-5p and miR-7-1-3p), whose transfection in primary hepatocytes reduced GFP intensity (Fig. 1C), may serve as negative regulator of fibrosis.

PARAGRAPH

Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1) is secreted by activated HSCs and inhibits metalloproteinases to suppress extracellular matrix degradation.20,21

We therefore measured levels of secreted TIMP1, as an unbiased second parameter to identify miRNAs, which are capable of regulating fibrosis.

Based on 3 independent experiments, we found that transfection of miR-221-3p and miR-17-5p mimics led to significant increase in TIMP1 levels as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Fig. 1D and Fig. S1A).

We then confirmed elevation in TIMP1 levels in primary mouse HSCs (instead of Col-GFP HSCs) that were co-cultured with primary hepatocytes transfected with either miR-221-3p (Fig. 1E) or miR-17-5p mimic (Fig. S1B).

The transfection of miR-221-3p (Fig. 1E) but not miR-17-5p mimics (Fig. S1B) led to significant elevation in TIMP1 levels, indicating that only gain of miR-221-3p in hepatocytes affected fibrogenesis from co-cultured primary mouse HSCs.

Furthermore, miR-221-3p mimic transfection led to higher mRNA levels of characteristic fibrogenic markers such as Col1a1, Acta2, and Tgfbr1 (Fig. 1E).

To rule out whether miRNA-221-3p is transferred from primary mouse hepatocytes, which were transfected with miR-221-3p mimic, to primary HSCs, we analysed miR-221-3p expression in both cell types.

We observed significantly higher levels of miR-221-3p only in primary hepatocytes but not in primary HSCs (Fig. S1C), thus excluding any passive transfer of miRNA from hepatocytes to HSCs in our co-culture setting.

Therefore, based on our functional miRNA library screening, and subsequent analyses of TIMP1 secretion and fibrogenic markers, we identified miR-221-3p as a potential fibrosis regulator and selected it for further study.

SECTION

miR-221-3p is upregulated in primary hepatocytes during liver fibrosis

PARAGRAPH

Our screen indicated a potential fibrogenic role of miR-221-3p mimic in cultured primary hepatocytes in vitro.

To understand the relevance of this finding in liver fibrosis, we determined miR-221-3p levels in a mouse model of liver fibrosis, which was induced by injecting BALB/c mice with CCl4 for 8 weeks.

At first, we confirmed liver fibrosis by Sirius Red staining (Fig. S2A) and mRNA expression analyses of profibrogenic markers such as Col1a1, Acta2, and Tgfbr1, which were found to be increased in the fibrotic mouse livers (Fig. S2B).

PARAGRAPH

Because our screen suggested a pro-fibrogenic role of miR-221-3p, we reasoned that miR-221-3p levels should be deregulated during liver fibrosis.

We therefore measured miR-221-3p levels in livers of mice injected with CCl4.

We observed a high miR-221-3p expression in fibrotic liver tissues by in situ hybridisation (Fig. 2A).

The increased levels of miR-221-3p in fibrotic liver tissues were confirmed by qPCR analysis (Fig. 2B).

To further confirm whether miR-221-3p expression is enhanced in hepatocytes, we purified primary hepatocytes from fibrotic livers by liver perfusion followed by density gradient centrifugation.

We observed significant upregulation of miR-221-3p in hepatocytes (10.69-fold) isolated from the fibrotic mouse liver tissues compared with hepatocytes obtained from normal healthy liver (Fig. 2C).

In addition to hepatocytes, we found significant upregulation of miR-221-3p in HSCs as reported previously,22 and a mild though not significant increase in Kupffer cells isolated from fibrotic livers.

PARAGRAPH

Because miR-221-3p is upregulated in hepatocytes during liver fibrosis, we investigated the effect of miR-221-3p inhibition in hepatocytes on liver fibrosis.

To effectively knock down the expression of miR-221-3p in vivo and in vitro, we used Tough Decoys (TuDs).

TuDs possess a hairpin structure containing 2 bulged miRNA targeting sites, which contribute to imperfect base pairing with the miRNA of interest.13,23

TuDs have previously been reported to inhibit miRNA function efficiently.13

We first confirmed downregulation of miR-221-3p upon transfection of primary hepatocytes with TuD-miR-221-3p (Fig. 2D).

Importantly, to examine efficacy of TuD-miR-221-3p at the functional level, we analysed the protein level of PUMA (encoded by the BBC3 gene), a known target of miR-221-3p,15 in primary hepatocytes transfected with TuD-miR-221-3p.

We observed increased PUMA levels upon TuD-miR-221-3p transfection (Fig. 2E).

These results suggest that the TuD-miR-221-3p is able to inhibit miR-221-3p expression efficiently at the functional level as well.

SECTION

MiR-221-3p inhibition in hepatocytes leads to faster resolution of liver fibrosis in vivo

PARAGRAPH

Because our functional miRNA screening resulted in identification of miR-221-3p and its expression was also upregulated in hepatocytes during fibrosis, we hypothesised that inhibition of miR-221-3p in hepatocytes of fibrotic livers would ameliorate liver fibrosis.

To test this hypothesis, we aimed to inhibit miR-221-3p in hepatocytes of fibrotic livers by injecting mice with 1 × 1010 AAV8 encoding TuD-miR-221-3p (AAV TuD) at 6th and 8th week of CCl4 treatment (Fig. 3A).

Mice were killed 1 week after the second AAV injection.

To suppress miR-221-3p specifically in hepatocytes, we expressed TuD-miR-221-3p under the transcriptional control of hepatocyte-specific transthyretin (Ttr) promoter, which significantly downregulated miR-221-3p in hepatocytes (Fig. 3B).

To confirm functional repression of miR-221-3p in vivo, we detected protein levels of PUMA by immunoblotting.

PUMA was found to be upregulated in hepatocytes isolated from fibrotic livers of mice injected with AAV TuD, indicating functional repression of miR-221-3p (Fig. 3C).

After confirming miR-221-3p inhibition in vivo, we determined fibrosis by histology and Sirius Red staining.

We observed reduced liver damage and less Sirius Red-stained areas in livers of mice injected with AAV TuD compared with respective controls (Fig. 3D).

Correlating with the results of Sirius Red staining, reduced cellular infiltration was also observed in liver tissues of mice injected with AAV TuD compared with those injected with AAV control (Fig. 3D).

Moreover, the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and bilirubin were significantly downregulated in serum samples of mice injected with AAV TuD compared with the respective controls (Fig. 3E), suggesting reduced liver injury upon miR-221-3p suppression in vivo.

PARAGRAPH

Because the development of fibrosis is regulated by HSCs, we investigated whether the markers of HSC activation decreased upon miR-221-3p inhibition.

The mRNA levels of profibrogenic markers, Col1a1, Acta2, and Tgfbr1 (Fig. 3F), and the total collagen content (Fig. 3G) were significantly downregulated in mice injected with AAV TuD.

Quiescent HSCs are activated in response to injury by differentiating into α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)-expressing myofibroblasts.24

We observed significantly lower α-SMA- and desmin-positive cells (Fig. 3H) in the livers of mice injected with AAV TuD, suggesting reduced fibrosis upon miR-221-3p inhibition.

To further confirm that miR-221 inhibition in hepatocytes reduces fibrosis, we isolated HSCs from mice injected with either AAV TuD or AAV control, and measured the expression of Col1a1, Lox, and Acta2, which are considered markers of HSC activation.

We found a significantly lower expression of Col1a1, Lox, and Acta2 (Fig. 3I), indicating reduced fibrosis upon inhibition of miR-221-3p in hepatocytes.

Taken together, in vivo inhibition of miR-221-3p in fibrotic liver by AAV TuD ameliorates liver fibrosis.

PARAGRAPH

To rule out adverse effects of miR-221-3p suppression in normal livers, we performed haematoxylin–eosin and Sirius Red staining and measured ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels in healthy mice injected with AAV control and AAV TuD.

Haematoxylin–eosin, Sirius Red staining, mRNA expression of fibrogenic markers, AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels indicated absence of any liver damage upon administration of AAV TuD (Fig. S3).

These results suggest that AAV TuD neither caused damage nor induced liver fibrosis in healthy livers, and hence, may be suitable for miR-221-3p inhibition in the clinic.

PARAGRAPH

CYP2E1 is considered a key metabolic enzyme for CCl4-induced toxicity.

Specifically, CYP2E1 deficiency protects mice against CCl4-induced liver injury.25

Therefore, to rule out the possibility that AAV TuD administration reduced Cyp2e1 levels and hence exhibited lower fibrosis, we measured Cyp2e1 mRNA by qPCR.

Both AAV TuD and AAV control groups of mice showed similar levels of Cyp2e1 (Fig. S4), indicating that Cyp2e1 levels did not contribute to attenuated fibrosis in AAV TuD-injected mice.

SECTION

Post-transcriptional regulation of Gnai2 by miR-221-3p during liver fibrosis

PARAGRAPH

To investigate the underlying mechanism leading to amelioration of liver fibrosis upon miR-221-3p inhibition, we performed in silico analyses to identify potential miR-221-3p targets that may play a role in liver fibrosis.

We used algorithms such as TargetScan (http://www.targetscan.org/), miRDB (http://mirdb.org/miRDB/), and PicTar (http://pictar.mdc-berlin.de/) to narrow down the potential miR-221-3p target gene list (Fig. S5A).

To cluster the functions of the candidate genes, we applied DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) analyses for functional gene annotation (Fig. S5B) to uncover mechanism of amelioration of liver fibrosis upon miR-221-3p.

We identified Gnai2 (G protein alpha inhibiting activity polypeptide 2), which has previously been suggested to play key roles in chronic liver diseases,26 as a promising candidate.

The 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of Gnai2 contains a binding site for miR-221-3p that is conserved in mouse and human (Fig. 4A).

To address whether GNAI2 is regulated during liver fibrosis, we analysed GNAI2 protein levels in hepatocytes isolated from mice with healthy and fibrotic livers.

The protein levels of GNAI2 were found to be decreased in hepatocytes from fibrotic livers compared with those from healthy livers (Fig. 4B).

This indicates that the decrease in GNAI2 protein levels could be due to upregulated levels of miR-221-3p during liver fibrosis.

Consistent with these findings, the Gnai2 mRNA expression and the GNAI2 protein levels were de-repressed in hepatocytes of mice with fibrotic livers injected with AAV TuD (Fig. 4C–D).

PARAGRAPH

To determine whether Gnai2 is indeed regulated by miR-221-3p, we transfected primary mouse hepatocytes with miR-221-3p mimic or Scr and analysed the protein levels by immunoblotting.

GNAI2 protein levels decreased in cells transfected with miR-221-3p mimic compared with cells transfected with Scrs (Fig. 4E).

To determine whether Gnai2 is a bona fide target of miR-221-3p, we cloned the 3′UTR of Gnai2 into a dual luciferase pmirGLO vector and co-transfected this vector with miR-221-3p mimic or Scr into primary mouse hepatocytes.

The dual luciferase reporter assay showed that the luciferase activity significantly decreased in cells co-transfected with miR-221-3p mimic, confirming that Gnai2 is a novel direct target of miR-221-3p (Fig. 4F).

In addition to GNAI2, we examined the expression of GNAI3, a member of the Gi group that is frequently downregulated in liver diseases.27

The protein level of GNAI3 was not regulated in hepatocytes upon inhibition of miR-221-3p in vivo (Fig. S5C), thus indicating that only Gnai2 but not Gnai3 is regulated by miR-221-3p at the post-transcriptional level.

SECTION

MiR-221-3p inhibition in hepatocytes suppresses HSC activation via GNAI2

PARAGRAPH

To address whether modulation of Gnai2 in hepatocytes regulates the activation of HSCs, we established transwell co-cultures of primary mouse hepatocytes and primary mouse HSCs.

Hepatocytes were cultured in transwells overnight and transfected with a GNAI2 expression vector (pCMV-GNAI2-GFP).

After 12 hours of transfection, the transwells were placed on top of primary mouse HSCs.

The upregulated expression of Gnai2 mRNA in primary mouse hepatocytes was confirmed at 24 hours post transfection (Fig. S6A).

The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is expressed at low levels in quiescent HSCs but is rapidly increased after its activation.28,29

We then examined p75Ntr, Acta2, and Des mRNA expression levels by qPCR and protein levels by immunofluorescence staining.

Both mRNA and protein levels of p75Ntr, Acta2, and Des were significantly downregulated in primary mouse HSCs co-cultured with GNAI2-overexpressing primary mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 5A,B).

PARAGRAPH

To further confirm whether GNAI2 contributes to the antifibrotic effect observed upon miR-221-3p inhibition, we co-cultured primary mouse HSCs with primary mouse hepatocytes, which were co-transfected with miR-221-3p inhibitor and small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Gnai2.

We found that the antifibrotic effects observed upon miR-221-3p inhibition were moderately, but significantly diminished when hepatocytes were co-transfected with Gnai2 siRNA (Fig. 5C).

These results suggest that GNAI2 indeed contributes to reduced HSC activation upon miR-221-3p inhibition in hepatocytes.

PARAGRAPH

To address whether Gnai2 overexpression affects functionality of hepatocytes, we analysed the expression of functional markers of hepatocytes such as Alb, Krt18, and Hnf4a.

We found similar levels of all 3 hepatocyte markers upon Gnai2 overexpression compared with control (Fig. S6B), indicating that overexpression of Gnai2 does not affect hepatocyte functions.

PARAGRAPH

We next sought to address the regulatory mechanism of HSC activation by GNAI2.

Chemokine CCL2, one of the key regulators of inflammation and liver fibrosis,30 has previously been reported to be elevated upon knockdown of Gnai2 in mice.31

Because we observed regulation of Gnai2 by miR-221-3p, we reasoned that CCL2 could be a key component of miR-221-3p-GNAI2 signalling.

We found a downregulation of Ccl2 mRNA expression in hepatocytes, but not in non-parenchymal cells from mice with liver fibrosis injected with AAV TuD (Fig. 6A,B and Fig. S7).

Consistent with these results, overexpression of GNAI2 in primary mouse hepatocytes led to a significant reduction in CCL2 secretion (Fig. 6C).

PARAGRAPH

To confirm whether reduction in CCL2 is exerted by miR-221-3p inhibition, we collected supernatant from the culture medium of transfected primary mouse hepatocytes with miR-221-3p inhibitors.

The ELISA results indeed confirmed reduction in secreted CCL2 levels (Fig. 6D).

In accordance with these results, siRNA-based knockdown of Gnai2 mRNA (Fig. 6E) led to a significant increase in secreted CCL2 levels (Fig. 6F).

PARAGRAPH

To further verify the direct effects of CCL2 on HSCs, we treated primary mouse HSCs with 100 ng/ml CCL2 for 48 hours and measured expression of fibrotic markers by qPCR and immunofluorescence staining.

The expression of Col1a1, Acta2, and Tgfbr1 and protein levels of p75NTR, α-SMA, and desmin were significantly upregulated in primary mouse HSCs treated with CCL2 (Fig. 6G,H).

Consistent with these results, primary mouse HSCs treated with the supernatant collected from primary mouse hepatocytes transfected with miR-221-3p inhibitors showed significant downregulation of Col1a1, Acta2, and Tgfbr1 by qPCR and protein levels of p75NTR, α-SMA, and desmin (Fig. 6I,J).

Taken together, our data suggest that upregulation of GNAI2 inhibited the expression of both Ccl2 mRNA and CCL2 protein levels in hepatocytes that led to the inhibition of HSC activation and amelioration of liver fibrosis.

PARAGRAPH

In addition to being a potent activator for HSC, CCL2 promotes chemotaxis for monocytes derived from bone marrow.

We, therefore, investigated whether miR-221-3p mitigated fibrosis not only by reducing HSC activation but also by reducing monocyte recruitment.

To address this, we analysed monocyte recruitment by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Fig. S8A) as well as immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. S8B) for CD11b and F4/80.

We observed lower number of CD11b and F4/80 cells, indicating that reduced monocyte recruitment indeed contributed to mitigation of liver fibrosis upon miR-221-3p inhibition in hepatocytes.

PARAGRAPH

We next evaluated whether attenuation of fibrosis upon miR-221-3p inhibition is restricted to the CCl4 model only.

To answer this, we injected AAV TuD in mice fed with 3,5-di-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC)-containing diet, a model of cholestasis-induced fibrosis (Fig. 7A).

We analysed fibrosis by histology, Sirius Red staining, hydroxyproline assay, fibrogenic markers’ mRNA analyses in whole liver and isolated HSCs, and immunofluorescence staining for α-SMA, p75NTR, and desmin (Fig. 7B–F and Fig. S9A).

The absence of dramatic changes in the expression of fibrogenic genes in isolated HSCs (Fig. 7F) might be due to cellular contamination resulting from the technically challenging perfusion of livers from DDC-fed mice (Fig. S9B).

Taken together, as with the CCl4 model, we observed attenuation of DDC-induced liver fibrosis upon miR-221-3p inhibition.

PARAGRAPH

To examine whether our findings are applicable to human hepatocytes, we first inhibited miR-221-3p in primary human hepatocytes by transfecting them with miR-221-3p inhibitor, and collected medium for the next 48 hours (Fig. 8A).

We then treated primary human myofibroblasts with culture medium collected from primary human hepatocytes (Fig. 8A).

Subsequent qPCR analyses for Col1a1, Acta2, and Tgfbr1 (Fig. 8B) and immunofluorescence staining for p75NTR, α-SMA, desmin, and LOX (Fig. 8C) showed significantly reduced expression of all markers in primary human myofibroblasts.

These results indicate that culture medium collected from miR-221-3p-inhibited primary human hepatocytes is able to reduce activation of primary human myofibroblasts.

PARAGRAPH

Finally, we investigated whether miR-221-3p expression is changed in primary human hepatocytes isolated from fibrotic livers.

In concert with mouse data, miR-221-3p expression by qPCR analyses showed an upregulation in primary human hepatocytes isolated from fibrotic livers compared with non-fibrotic control livers (Fig. 8D).

Furthermore, miR-221-3p upregulation correlated with reduced GNAI2 and concomitant upregulation of CCL2 protein levels in primary human hepatocytes obtained from fibrotic livers compared with respective controls (Fig. 8E).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Current antifibrotic therapies mainly focus on HSCs such as the prevention of HSC activation, inhibition of fibrogenesis, and the resolution of fibrosis.32

However, hepatocytes consist of up to 80% of the liver mass and are responsible for mediating a broad range of interactions between different cell types such as HSCs, Kupffer cells, and epithelial cells.20

Our study highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting hepatocytes for treating liver fibrosis.

We demonstrate that miR-221-3p is upregulated in hepatocytes during liver fibrosis.

Importantly, in vivo knockdown of miR-221-3p by AAV TuD specifically in hepatocytes not only suppresses HSC activation but also alleviates CCl4- and DDC-induced liver fibrosis in mice.

Unlike other methods of RNA silencing that lead to systemic effects, hepatotrophic AAV TuD specifically targets hepatocytes and spares the off-target effects.15,33,34

Therefore, as the most abundant cell type in the liver, the hepatocytes not only play an important role in regulating the activation of HSCs in liver damage, but also have an advantage of being a therapeutic target of liver fibrosis.

PARAGRAPH

Mechanistically, we identified Gnai2 as a novel miR-221-3p target.

GNAI2, which belongs to the inhibitory G alpha family, is involved in signalling pathways related to cell cycle and hormone regulation.35,36

GNAI2 is downregulated in HCC, and knockdown of GNAI2 expression significantly increases cell invasion and migration in vitro, suggesting that GNAI2 plays a role in suppressing metastasis.26

Consistent with upregulation of miR-221-3p expression in a mouse model of liver fibrosis, GNAI2 levels are reduced in liver fibrosis, indicating its pathophysiological relevance.

Importantly, GNAI2-overexpressing hepatocytes suppressed the HSC activation in co-culture experiments in vitro.

The CCR2–CCL2 signalling axis is a major regulator of HSC activation.20

It has been shown that either blocking of CCL2 in rats or depletion of CCR2 in mice genetically37 as well as pharmacological inhibition of CCL2 remarkably attenuates liver fibrosis.38

Further, the high expression of CCL2 in HCC is associated with the poor prognosis of patients.30

Furthermore, the loss of GNAI2 in Gnai2−/− mice leads to increased CCL2 in chronic inflammation.31

Importantly, we found that overexpression of GNAI2 in primary mouse hepatocytes results in reduced levels of CCL2.

Thus, our findings indicate that miR-221-3p inhibition in hepatocytes suppressed the activation of HSCs via regulation of the miR-221-GNAI2-CCL2 axis.

Our data revealed that decreased CCl2 levels upon miR-221-3p inhibition contribute to amelioration of fibrosis by not only reducing HSC activation but also lowering the monocyte recruitment in liver.

We thus demonstrate for the first time that knocking down the expression of miR-221-3p in hepatocytes leads to decreased activation of HSCs, and finally amelioration of liver fibrosis.

In concert with data obtained from mouse experiments, we demonstrated that miR-221-3p inhibition in primary human hepatocytes was capable of reducing fibrogenic markers in primary human myofibroblasts, indicating translational relevance of our findings.

Although our in vitro experiments suggest a direct interaction between hepatocytes and myofibroblasts, there remains a possibility that protective activity of AAV TuD in hepatocytes also suppresses liver injury.

In fact, the lower levels of ALT, AST, and bilirubin in mice injected with AAV TuD indicate less hepatocyte injury, which in turn may result in a reduced fibrosis response.

It is important to mention that sustained overexpression of miR-221 for several months in mice promotes tumorigenicity in liver.39

Furthermore, silencing of miR-221 by synthetic anti-miR is able to hinder hepatocellular carcinoma progression,40 indicating reduced hepatocellular injury.

Therefore, in light of our results and previously published data,39,40 we cannot exclude the possibility that reduced injury of hepatocytes may have also contributed to the observed mitigation of fibrosis.

PARAGRAPH

Taken together, we show that suppression of miR-221-3p in hepatocytes of fibrotic livers leads to faster resolution of the deposited extracellular matrix.

Furthermore, downregulation of miR-221-3p induces the expression of GNAI2 in hepatocytes, which in turn inhibits CCL2 secretion, and hence leads to reduced HSC activation and amelioration of liver fibrosis.

Our study highlights the promising potential of miRNA-221-3p as a therapeutic intervention for liver disease.
