ABSTRACT

TITLE

Hepatitis C virus eradication by direct-acting antiviral agents improves carotid atherosclerosis in patients with severe liver fibrosis

PARAGRAPH

Recent studies suggest an association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and cardiovascular damage, including carotid atherosclerosis, with a possible effect of HCV clearance on cardiovascular outcomes.

We aimed to examine whether HCV eradication by direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) improves carotid atherosclerosis in HCV-infected patients with advanced fibrosis/compensated cirrhosis.

PARAGRAPH

One hundred eighty-two consecutive patients with HCV and advanced fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis were evaluated.

All patients underwent DAA-based antiviral therapy according to AISF/EASL guidelines.

Intima-media thickness (IMT), carotid thickening (IMT ≥1 mm) and carotid plaques, defined as focal thickening of ≥1.5 mm at the level of the common carotid, were evaluated by ultrasonography (US) at baseline and 9–12 months after the end of therapy.

Fifty-six percent of patients were male, mean age 63.1 ± 10.4 years, and 65.9% had compensated cirrhosis.

One in five had diabetes, 14.3% were obese, 41.8% had arterial hypertension and 35.2% were smokers.

At baseline, mean IMT was 0.94 ± 0.29 mm, 42.8% had IMT ≥1 mm, and 42.8% had carotid plaques.

PARAGRAPH

All patients achieved a 12-week sustained virological response.

IMT significantly decreased from baseline to follow-up (0.94 ± 0.29 mm vs. 0.81 ± 0.27, p <0.001).

Consistently, a significant reduction in the prevalence of patients with carotid thickening from baseline to follow-up was observed (42.8% vs. 17%, p <0.001), while no changes were reported for carotid plaques (42.8% vs. 47.8%, p = 0.34).

These results were confirmed in subgroups of patients stratified for cardiovascular risk factors and liver disease severity.

PARAGRAPH

HCV eradication by DAA improves carotid atherosclerosis in patients with severe fibrosis with or without additional metabolic risk factors.

The impact of this improvement in the atherosclerotic burden in terms of reduction of major cardiovascular outcomes is worth investigating in the long term.
