TITLE

Urea cycle dysregulation in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

PARAGRAPH

In patients with fatty liver disease, the enzymes that convert nitrogen waste into urea may be affected, leading to the accumulation of ammonia, which is toxic.

This accumulation of ammonia can lead to scar tissue development, increasing the risk of disease progression.

In this study, we show that fat accumulation in the liver produces a reversible reduction in the function of the enzymes that are involved in detoxification of ammonia.

These data provide potential new targets for the treatment of fatty liver disease.
