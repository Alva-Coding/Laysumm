ABSTRACT

TITLE

Comparison of extracellular and hepatobiliary MR contrast agents for the diagnosis of small HCCs

PARAGRAPH

The aim of this study was to compare the performance of MRIs with extracellular contrast agents (ECA-MRI) to HB contrast agents (HBA-MRI) for the non-invasive diagnosis of small HCCs in a head-to-head comparison.

PARAGRAPH

Between August 2014 and October 2017; 171 cirrhotic patients, each with 1 to 3 nodules measuring 1 to 3 cm, were included across eight centers.

All patients had both an ECA-MRI and an HBA-MRI within a month.

The non-invasive diagnosis of HCC was made when the nodule was hyper-enhanced at the arterial phase (HA) with wash-out at the portal phase (PP) and/or delayed phase (DP) for the ECA-MRI, or PP and/or HB phase (HBP) for the HBA-MRI.

The gold standard was defined by a composite algorithm previously published.

PARAGRAPH

225 nodules, of which 153 were HCCs and 72 were not HCCs, were included.

Both MRI sensitivities were similar (71.2% [63.4-78.3]).

Specificity was 83.3% [72.7-91.1] for the ECA-MRI and 68.1% [56.0-78.6] for the HBA-MRI.

With regard to HCCs, on ECA-MRI, 138 were HA, 84 had wash-out at PP and 104 at DP; on HBA-MRI, 128 were HA, 71 had wash-out at PP and 99 at HBP.

For nodules from 2 to 3 cm, sensitivity and specificity were similar with 70.9% [57.1-82.4] and 75.0% [47.6-92.7] respectively.

For nodules from 1 to 2 cm, specificity dropped to 66.1% [52.2-78.2] for the HBA-MRI vs. 85.7% [73.8-93.6] for the ECA-MRI.

PARAGRAPH

HBA-MRI specificity is lower than ECA-MRI for diagnosing small HCCs on cirrhotic patients.

These results raise the question of the proper use of HBA-MRI in algorithms for the non-invasive diagnosis of small HCCs.
