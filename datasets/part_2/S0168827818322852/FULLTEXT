TITLE

Midodrine and albumin for prevention of complications in patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation. A randomized placebo-controlled trial

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

The natural history of decompensated cirrhosis is characterized by the development of recurrent complications of the disease, leading to frequent hospital admissions, impaired quality of life and increased mortality.1–5

Liver transplantation (LT) is the definitive treatment for patients with end-stage liver disease.

Patients with decompensated cirrhosis achieve good outcomes after LT with three-year survival above 80%.5–8

However, one of the major concerns is the development of complications while on the waiting list, which may be a cause of death or may delay or preclude patients with decompensated cirrhosis from receiving LT.9–12

PARAGRAPH

Some strategies have proved to be useful in preventing specific complications of cirrhosis, such as beta-blockers for prevention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, antibiotic prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or addition of rifaximin to lactulose treatment for recurrent hepatic encephalopathy (HE).6,13–15

Nevertheless, these approaches cannot completely prevent the development of these complications, and there are no strategies available to prevent other frequent complications, such as bacterial infections other than SBP, ascites, acute kidney injury or hyponatremia.

Therefore, there is an unmet need for effective strategies to prevent the development of complications in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, particularly those on the waiting list for LT, in order to improve outcomes and increase the probability of patients receiving LT.

PARAGRAPH

The common hallmark in the pathophysiology of complications of advanced cirrhosis is circulatory dysfunction, characterized by effective arterial hypovolemia.

The reduction in effective arterial blood volume leads to the activation of endogenous vasoconstrictor systems (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, sympathetic nervous system, vasopressin) that are responsible for some of the major complications of cirrhosis.16–18

Based on this pathophysiological basis, targeting circulatory dysfunction appears to be a promising therapeutic approach to decrease the development of complications.

PARAGRAPH

Vasoconstrictors and albumin have been shown to be useful to improve circulatory function in patients with advanced cirrhosis and, the combination of both drugs is currently the standard of care for the management of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).6,18–22

There is large amount of evidence showing that albumin is effective in preventing circulatory dysfunction following large-volume paracentesis, HRS in the setting of SBP and for the management of type 1 HRS.6,18,20–24

There is data showing that the administration of albumin together with diuretics for one year in patients after their first episode of ascites was associated with significantly improved survival;25 but information on the potential benefits of long-term albumin administration is scarce.

Besides its oncotic properties, albumin has properties that could also be useful for the prevention of complications of cirrhosis, including antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects, as well as a possible positive impact on endothelial function.26

Midodrine is an alpha-1 agonist that has been shown to improve circulatory and kidney function in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.27–29

Compared to other vasoconstrictors, midodrine has the advantage that is active orally and, therefore, could be easily used in a long-term strategy.

Three randomized pilot studies, in small patient samples, have been reported assessing the effects of midodrine in patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites.30–32

These studies showed that the administration of midodrine was associated with an improvement of systemic hemodynamics and better control of ascites; however, they failed to demonstrate improvement of other complications of cirrhosis.

Despite the scarcity of randomized clinical trials, midodrine is currently used in daily clinical practice in patients with cirrhosis in many countries.

In fact, a survey that we performed in 2017 among members of the International Club of Ascites (ICA), showed that out of the 83 members that answered the survey, 49% frequently used midodrine for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis; and this percentage increased to 86% if only physicians from North America were considered (E. Solà, unpublished).

The situations in which midodrine is mainly used are HRS, refractory ascites and arterial hypotension.

PARAGRAPH

On this background, we designed a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of long-term administration of oral midodine and intravenous (i.v.) albumin for prevention of complications in patients with decompensated cirrhosis on the waiting list for LT.

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Trial design

PARAGRAPH

The MACHT (midodrine and albumin for cirrhotic patients in the waiting list for liver transplantation) study was a multicenter, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that included 196 consecutive patients with cirrhosis and ascites awaiting LT from the three liver transplant centers in Catalonia (Spain) from August 2008 to March 2015 (Hospital Clínic Barcelona, Hospital Vall d’Hebron and Hospital de Bellvitge).

Patients were randomly assigned to receive midodrine and i.v. albumin or matching placebos for one year or until LT, permanent withdrawal from the waiting list or death.

The study was approved by the Spanish national regulatory agency and by the institutional review board from each participating center.

Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

The study was independently monitored by the Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) from Hospital Clínic of Barcelona (Spain).

The study was registered at European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT N° 2007-005723-14) and at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00839358).

PARAGRAPH

The study was supported by a grant from the Instituto de Salud Carlos III (EC07/90077) included in a program for independent investigations.

None of the pharmaceutical companies whose products were involved in the study participated in the design of the study, analysis of data or writing of the manuscript.

The medications were purchased using the budget from the grant.

No economic support was provided by the companies, except that Grifols S.A. (Spain) gave a donation to support the transport costs incurred by patients participating in the study.

SECTION

Participants

PARAGRAPH

The eligible population to be included in the study were patients with cirrhosis and ascites included on the waiting list for LT. Inclusion criteria were: i) age older than 18 years; ii) cirrhosis defined by standard clinical, analytical and/or histological criteria; iii) patients on the waiting list for LT; iv) ascites; and v) written informed consent.

Exclusion criteria were: arterial hypertension defined as systolic arterial pressure ≥150 mmHg and/or diastolic arterial pressure ≥90 mmHg or drug therapy for arterial hypertension; treatment with psychotropic drugs; transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS); treatment with antibiotics within the last seven days prior to study inclusion except for norfloxacin or rifaximin as prophylaxis for SBP or recurrent HE, respectively; chronic heart or respiratory failure; listed for combined liver-kidney transplant; previous liver transplant; human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV); hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection treated with direct-acting antivirals, and contraindications to midodrine.

SECTION

Interventions

PARAGRAPH

Study medication was started as soon as possible after the patient was included on the LT waiting list.

Patients were randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive oral midodrine (Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Madrid, Spain) and i.v. 20% human albumin (Grifols, S.A., Parets del Vallès, Catalonia) or matching placebo of both drugs.

Study control visits were performed every 15 days, and standard clinical and analytical data were collected and any complication of cirrhosis or treatment-related adverse events were registered.

Midodrine was started at a dose of 15 mg/day (one tablet of 5 mg every 8 h).

If in the next control visit (15 days) the increase in mean arterial pressure was <10 mmHg, midodrine dose was increased to the maximum dose of 30 mg/day (two tablets of 5 mg every 8 h).

Then midodrine dose could be increased from 15 to 30 mg/day at any time during the study period if the increase in mean arterial pressure from the current control visit compared to baseline visit was <10 mmHg.

Albumin was administered i.v. at a dose of 40 g (two flasks of 100 ml of 20% albumin) every 15 days.

PARAGRAPH

Patients in the placebo group received one or two placebo tablets every 8 h.

The increase in the number of tablets was performed in an identical way to that of midodrine because the study was double-blinded.

Placebo of albumin was administered as 100 ml flasks of 0.9% saline solution (two flasks every 15 days).

PARAGRAPH

Treatment was administered for one year.

Study medication was permanently withdrawn if patients underwent LT, were withdrawn from the waiting list or developed severe treatment-related side effects.

Treatment was temporarily stopped in patients developing complications of cirrhosis leading to hospital admission if they had impaired oral intake or required treatment that contraindicated the concomitant use of midodrine and albumin.

Study medication was reinitiated as soon as possible once complications had been solved.

Complications of cirrhosis occurring during the study period were treated according to current international guidelines.6

SECTION

Outcomes

PARAGRAPH

The primary endpoint of the study was the incidence of complications of cirrhosis during the study period, including renal failure, hyponatremia, bacterial infections, HE or gastrointestinal bleeding (see definitions in supplementary information).

This was analyzed in two different ways: first, the probability of developing complications and the time to develop the first complication during study follow-up were analyzed.

Second, the incidence of all individual complications and the total number of episodes of each complication occurring during follow-up was also assessed.

For this purpose, all recurrent complications occurring in the same patient were considered.

PARAGRAPH

Secondary endpoints included: i) mortality at 24 and 48 weeks; ii) effects of treatment on the control of ascites; iii) effects of treatment on the activity of endogenous vasoconstrictor systems, as assessed by plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma levels of aldosterone and norepinephrine at baseline and at months 3, 6 and 12 (see supplementary information); iv) changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α levels measured at baseline and at months 3, 6 and 12; v) effects of treatment on health-related quality of life as assessed by short form 36 (SF-36) and chronic liver disease questionnaires (CLDQs) performed at baseline and at months 3, 6 and 1233,34 (see supplementary information); vi) effects of treatment on minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) assessed by the psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES) performed at baseline and at months 3, 6 and 12;35 and vii) treatment-related adverse events.

SECTION

Sample size

PARAGRAPH

The study protocol required a sample size of 97 patients per arm to observe as statistically significant 20% difference between the expected incidence of complications in the placebo group (50%) and in the midodrine plus albumin group (30%), assuming a 5% type I error, an 80% power and 5% withdrawals.

With the same assumptions, the final study size of full analysis set (n = 173) allows for detection of a 21% difference between study arms.

SECTION

Randomization

PARAGRAPH

Randomization was performed at the CTU of the Hospital Clínic of Barcelona.

A computer-generated, pseudo-random sequence in blocks of four individuals (2:2) was performed for patients from each center, using MAS software (Version 2.1, Glaxo Wellcome).

Randomization was stratified according to serum creatinine (< or ≥1.2 mg/dl).

SECTION

Blinding

PARAGRAPH

Study medication was prepared at the Pharmacy Department of Hospital Vall d’Hebron (Barcelona).

All investigators and patients were blinded to treatment assignment.

Midrodrine (Gutron®) in 5 mg pills was purchased from Takeda Phramaceuticals S.A. (Spain).

Excipients to prepare placebo were purchased from Acofarma (Spain).

Midodrine and placebo were encapsulated in pills with identical appearance.

Human albumin (20%, 100 ml flasks) was purchased from Grifols S.A. (Spain).

Placebo was prepared as 0.9% saline solution (100 ml flasks).

Considering that both i.v. solutions could not be manipulated to obtain the same organoleptic characteristics, blinding was performed by covering all flasks with opaque bags and i.v. solutions were administered using opaque lines.

SECTION

Statistical methods

PARAGRAPH

Categorical variables were summarized by counts and proportions and continuous variables by mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR) depending on the normality of their distribution.

Chi-square tests were used to compare categorical variables, while Student’s t tests or ANOVAs were used to compare normally distributed continuous variables.

Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric ANOVA were used for the rest of continuous variables.

Time-to-event variables were described by Kaplan-Meier curves and compared between groups by means of the Log-rank test.

The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistical package, version 23.0.

For all tests, the significance level was set at 0.05 for two-tailed analysis.

Results

SECTION

Characteristics of study population

PARAGRAPH

Six hundred and six patients were assessed for eligibility.

A total of 410 patients were excluded because they fulfilled exclusion criteria or denied consent (Fig. 1).

The remaining 196 patients were randomly assigned to receive either treatment with midodrine and albumin (99 patients) or placebo of both drugs (97 patients).

Twelve patients from the midodrine plus albumin (M + A) group and 11 patients from the placebo group were excluded because they did not receive any dose of study medication.

Reasons for exclusion in the M + A group were: LT early after randomization but before starting treatment (n = 5), death (n = 1); consent withdrawal (n = 3) and randomization errors (n = 3).

Reasons for exclusion in the placebo group were: LT early after randomization but before starting treatment (n = 10) and randomization error because of fulfilling one exclusion criterion (n = 1).

Therefore, the full analysis set included a total of 173 patients (87 patients in the M + A group and 86 patients in the placebo group).

PARAGRAPH

Baseline demographical, clinical and analytical data from patients included in the study are shown (Table 1).

There were no significant differences between the two study groups.

As expected, patients from both groups had impaired liver function with mean model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score of 17 and 16 in the M + A group and placebo group, respectively (p = 0.343).

There were no significant differences between the two groups in the percentage of patients under antibiotic prophylaxis either with norfloxacin or rifaximin, or in those receiving beta-blocker therapy.

SECTION

Study treatment

PARAGRAPH

Median time between randomization and the initiation of treatment was not significantly different between the two groups.

Treatment was started the same day as randomization was performed in the majority of patients, with a median time range of 0–5 days.

PARAGRAPH

The overall median duration of study treatment per patient in the whole series was 80 days (IQR 30–244), with a trend for a longer duration in the placebo group than in the M + A group (105 vs. 63 days, respectively; p = 0.061).

Nine patients from the M + A group (10%) completed the one-year study treatment, compared to 20 patients from the placebo group (23%) (p = 0.023).

The most frequent causes of termination of the study in the M + A group and the placebo group were: LT (59 vs. 47 patients; p = 0.08), death (6 vs. 4 patients; p = 0.527), drop-off from the waiting list (2 vs. 5 patients; p = 0.241) and treatment-related adverse events (4 vs. 1 patient; p = 0.178).

PARAGRAPH

Median daily dose of midodrine throughout the study period was 23 mg/day in the M + A group.

Fifty-eight percent of patients in the M + A group and 69% in the placebo group (p = 0.129) received the maximum dose of midodrine or placebo during the study.

Albumin was administered at a dose of 40 g every two weeks.

The administration of i.v. albumin was associated with an increase of serum albumin concentration from 30 ± 0.6 (mean ± SD) at baseline to 32 ± 0.4, 34 ± 3.3, 34 ± 0.4 and 35 ± 0.4 g/L at weeks 4, 12, 24 and 48, respectively, in patients from the M + A group.

In patients from the placebo group, serum albumin concentration also increased from 30 ± 0.6 to 30 ± 0.5, 32 ± 0.5, 33 ± 0.6 and 39 ± 2.2 g/L at weeks 4, 12, 24 and 48.

The increase in serum albumin concentration was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.684).

There were no significant differences between groups in the median time that patients did not receive midodrine/placebo (2 [0–7] vs. 2 [0–10]; median [IQR]) days in the M + A group vs. placebo group, respectively; p = 0.639) or albumin/placebo (0 [0–8] vs. 0 [0–11] in the M + A group vs. placebo group, respectively; p = 0.830) due to intercurrent complications of cirrhosis.

SECTION

Incidence of complications of cirrhosis

PARAGRAPH

Thirty-two patients from the treatment group (37%) and 37 patients from the placebo group (43%) reached the primary endpoint of the study defined as developing any complication of cirrhosis during follow-up, including renal failure, bacterial infections, hyponatremia, HE or GI bleeding (p = 0.402).

There were neither significant differences in the probability of developing complications of cirrhosis during the study period (Fig. 2), nor in the time to develop the first complication.

The median time to develop the first complication of cirrhosis in patients from the M + A group was 16 days (IQR 0–38 days) compared to 26 days in patients from the placebo group (IQR 13–39 days) (p = 0.633).

The most frequent complication was HE, followed by hyponatremia, renal failure, bacterial infections and GI bleeding.

Considering that all complications included in the endpoint may be associated with different effects on prognosis, we next sought to analyze the incidence of each complication individually.

There were no significant differences in the incidence of any individual complication between the two groups (Table 2).

However, the episodes of hyponatremia and renal failure were more severe in patients from the placebo group compared to those of patients from the M + A group.

Mean peak serum creatinine during episodes of renal failure was 1.2 ± 0.3 vs. 1.5 ± 0.4 mg/dl in patients from the M + A group and placebo group, respectively (p = 0.01).

Similarly, mean trough serum sodium concentration during hyponatremia episodes was 134 ± 3 vs. 129 ± 5 mEq/L in patients from the M + A group and placebo group, respectively (p = 0.04).

There were no significant differences between groups in the severity of episodes of HE.

PARAGRAPH

We also investigated the effects of treatment on MHE assessed by the PHES score.

PHES tests were performed in 73 (84%) and 70 (81%) patients from the M + A group and the placebo group, respectively.

Twenty-nine patients from the treatment group (40%) had MHE at baseline compared to 17 (24%) patients from the placebo group (p = 0.048).

However, there were no significant differences in the incidence or resolution of MHE during study follow-up (data not shown).

PARAGRAPH

Finally, treatment with M + A was not associated with a significant improvement in the control of ascites during the study.

There was neither a reduction in the dose of diuretic treatment nor in the requirement of large-volume paracentesis in the treatment group compared to the placebo group (see supplementary information for detailed results)

SECTION

Effects of treatment on circulatory function and systemic inflammation

PARAGRAPH

Treatment with M + A was not associated with significant changes in mean arterial pressure (Fig. 3).

Mean arterial pressure increased from 80 ± 10 at baseline to 86 ± 8 mmHg at week 48 (p = 0.167) in patients from the M + A group and from 81 ± 10 to 84 ± 12 in patients from the placebo group (p = 0.227).

Although 58% of patients from the M + A group and 69% from the placebo group received the maximum dose of midodrine (30 mg/day) only 6% and 4% of patients from the M + A group and the placebo group presented a persistent increase in mean arterial pressure throughout the study (p = 0.746), defined as an increase >10 mmHg in mean arterial pressure in >50% of the control visits.

PARAGRAPH

Although there were no significant changes in mean arterial pressure during study follow-up, treatment with M + A was associated with a slight but significant decrease in PRA at weeks 24 and 48 with respect to baseline values.

In contrast, there were no significant changes in PRA in patients from the placebo group (differences at week 24 and 48 with respect to baseline values, median [IQR]: −0.7 [−8.2–−0.3] vs. 0.4 [−0.9–2.3] ng/mL.h, p = 0.042; and −4.3 [−8.8–−1.7] vs. 0.1 [−1.7–1.5] ng/mL.h, p = 0.003, in M + A and placebo group respectively) (Fig. 3).

Likewise, there was a significant decrease in plasma aldosterone levels at weeks 12, 24 and 48 in patients from the M + A group compared to the placebo group (differences at weeks 12, 24 and 48 with respect to baseline values: −11 [−37–23] vs. 12 [−0.1–42] ng/dl, p = 0.008; –32 [−57–−4.3] vs. 1.9 [−21–21] ng/dl, p = 0.014; and −38 [−69–−15] vs. 6.4 [−16–29] ng/dl, p = 0.021, in M + A group and placebo group respectively) (Fig. 3).

In contrast to PRA and aldosterone, plasma levels of noradrenaline decreased significantly at week 4 in patients from the M + A group, but this effect was not maintained throughout the study period (Fig. 3).

These findings indicate that treatment with M + A caused a reduction in the activity of the renin-aldosterone system, but the effect on sympathetic nervous system activity was much lower.

With respect to cytokine levels, there were no significant changes in plasma levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α throughout the study period in the M + A group compared to the placebo group (Fig. S1).

SECTION

Liver transplantation, survival and quality of life

PARAGRAPH

As mentioned before, during the follow-up period, six (7%) patients died in the M + A group and four patients (5%) in the placebo group (p = 0.527).

Treatment with M + A was not associated with significant differences in the probability of transplant-free survival (Fig. 4).

The main causes of death in patients from the M + A group and the placebo group were: multiorgan failure (4 vs. 2 patients), GI bleeding (2 vs. 1 patients), and sepsis (0 vs. 1 patient).

Changes in MELD score were not significantly different between the two groups at any time point during the study follow-up period (MELD score at baseline and at weeks 4, 12 and 24 was 17 ± 6 vs. 16 ± 6.2, p = 0.343; 13 ± 4 vs. 13 ± 4, p = 0.671; 13 ± 3 vs. 13 ± 4, p = 0.945; 13 ± 2 vs. 12 ± 4, p = 0.890; in the M + A group and the placebo group, respectively).

There were no significant differences in health-related quality of life during follow-up between groups (see supplementary information).

PARAGRAPH

During the study period, 59 patients (68%) from the M + A group and 47 patients (55%) from the placebo group were transplanted (p = 0.08).

Median time from study randomization until LT was 42 (18–95) days in patients from the M + A group and 39 (9–114) days in patients from the placebo group (p = 0.666).

A univariate analysis showed that the variables associated with transplantation were MELD score and serum sodium (Table 3).

Treatment with M + A was not associated with the probability of transplantation in the univariate analysis.

PARAGRAPH

Patients undergoing transplantation were followed up for one month after LT. There were no significant differences in the incidence of complications post-LT, including kidney failure, bacterial infections, hyponatremia or bleeding, in patients in the M + A group compared to patients from the placebo group (Table S1).

SECTION

Adverse events

PARAGRAPH

There were no significant differences in the development of adverse events between groups (Table 4).

Eighty-three (95%) patients from the M + A group and 84 (98%) from the placebo group developed at least one adverse event during study follow-up (p = 0.682).

There were no significant differences in the number of patients who developed serious adverse events between groups (47 in the M + A group vs. 50 in the placebo group; p = 0.585).

The total number of adverse events was 524 and 442 in the M + A group and in the placebo group, respectively (p = 0.287), of which 54 in the M + A group and 36 in the placebo group were considered to be treatment-related by study investigators.

The most frequent type of adverse events were classified as gastrointestinal, followed by cutaneous and neurological adverse events.

Study treatment was definitively stopped because of adverse events in four patients from the M + A group (arterial hypertension) and one patient from the placebo group (abdominal pain) (p = 0.178).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with decompensated cirrhosis in the waiting list for LT, treatment with midodrine and albumin was not effective compared to placebo in the prevention of complications of cirrhosis.

In fact, there were neither differences in the incidence of complications during follow-up, nor in the time to development of the first complication.

However, treatment with midodrine and albumin attenuated the severity of complications related to kidney dysfunction, because renal failure and hyponatremia episodes were less intense in patients from the midodrine and albumin group.

PARAGRAPH

Treatment with midodrine and albumin was not associated with improvements in transplant-free survival compared to placebo.

Nevertheless, it should be noted that mortality on the waiting list in patients included in the study was very low in both groups (7% and 5% in the midodrine and albumin group and the placebo group, respectively).

These low mortality rates in both groups are because of a very high transplant rate related to the high availability of organs for transplantation in the area where the study was performed.

In fact, data from the OCATT (Catalan Organization of Transplantation) registry indicates an overall drop-out rate from the waiting list due to mortality of 8% during the period between 2008 and 2016.

Therefore, the low mortality rates in both groups could theoretically have hindered the detection of a potential benefit of treatment on survival.

PARAGRAPH

The rationale for treatment with midodrine and albumin was based on the fact that this treatment combination was expected to improve systemic hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis and, consequently, decrease the development of complications related to arterial vasodilation and circulatory dysfunction.

The findings of our study show that treatment with midodrine and albumin was associated with suppression, but not normalization, of the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, as indicated by a slight but significant decrease of PRA and plasma aldosterone during follow-up, but with much lower effect on the sympathetic nervous system.

Although there was a trend towards an increase in mean arterial pressure (80 and 86 mmHg at baseline and week 48, respectively), the effect was not statistically significant.

In fact, only 6% of patients from the treatment group showed a persistent increase in mean arterial pressure throughout the study (defined as an increase >10 mmHg in mean arterial pressure in >50% of the control visits).

These findings suggest that treatment had some effect on circulatory function by decreasing the activity of the renin-angiotensin system; however, the magnitude of that effect does not appear to be sufficient to lead to a clinically significant increase in arterial pressure.

PARAGRAPH

Analyzing the possible explanations why treatment with midodrine and albumin failed to prevent complications of cirrhosis is of interest.

First, it is possible that the slight improvement in circulatory function achieved in the midodrine and albumin group was insufficient to result in a significant modification of the natural history of cirrhosis.

In this regard, our findings are consistent with those of recent studies showing that in patients with advanced cirrhosis, midodrine and albumin treatment causes only a mild vasoconstrictor effect.36

The mild effect of midodrine on circulatory function was demonstrated in the current study by the low number of patients that reached the target of increase in arterial pressure despite being treated with the highest dose of the drug.

In contrast to midodrine, vasopressin analogues, such as terlipressin, have much greater vasoconstrictor action.19–22

Unfortunately, however, terlipressin is not suitable for long-term ambulatory treatment.

Another possibility to explain the failure of treatment is that other abnormalities of cirrhosis besides systemic circulatory dysfunction should be targeted to improve the natural history of the disease.

In this regard, modulation of systemic inflammation is of interest because of the marked alterations in immune function present in cirrhosis and their relationship with disease progression.37–39

Of note, treatment with midodrine and albumin did not seem to modify the inflammatory status, as indicated by lack of changes in plasma levels of several cytokines.

Lastly, it is also possible that the combination treatment with midodrine and albumin failed in the current study because the treatment duration was not long enough or the dose of albumin given was insufficient to achieve all potential benefits related to albumin administration.

Albumin may have beneficial effects other than those related to improved circulatory function, mainly related to its immunomodulatory and antioxidative properties.26

With respect to duration of treatment, although the study was designed for long-term treatment administration, median duration of treatment was 80 days.

The main reason for the shorter duration of treatment was a high rate of transplantation during follow-up in both groups.

This shows the complexity of performing natural history and interventional studies in patients awaiting transplantation and, it is a consideration that should be considered when planning long-term treatment strategies in patients on the waiting list for LT. Regarding the dose of albumin, at the time of study design limited data existed on the effect of long-term albumin treatment in patients with cirrhosis,25,40 therefore the dose selected for this trial was based on results from the most recent study at that time.25

In this regard, a recent multicenter trial performed in Italy showed that long-term administration of albumin alone (40 g twice weekly for the first two weeks, followed by 40 g/week) was associated with significant reduction of the main complications of cirrhosis and improved 18-month survival compared to a control group receiving standard of care without albumin infusions.41

Whether the discrepancy in endpoint achievements between this latter study and the current investigation is due to the higher dose of albumin used, differences in the patient population studied, or other factors is not known.

Further randomized studies in large patient populations are needed to evaluate the role of chronic albumin administration as a therapeutic approach to prevent complications and improve survival in cirrhosis.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, the results of the present study show that treatment with oral midodrine and i.v. albumin, at the doses and duration given in this therapeutic trial, in patients with decompensated cirrhosis on the waiting list for LT was neither associated with a decrease in the incidence of complications of cirrhosis nor with an improvement in survival.
