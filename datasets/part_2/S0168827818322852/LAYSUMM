TITLE

Midodrine and albumin for prevention of complications in patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation. A randomized placebo-controlled trial

PARAGRAPH

Patients with cirrhosis who are on the liver transplant waiting list often develop complications which prevent them from receiving a transplant.

Circulatory dysfunction is a key factor behind a number of complications.

This study was aimed at investigating whether treating patients with midodrine (a vasoconstrictor) and albumin would improve circulatory dysfunction and prevent complications.

This combined treatment, at least at the doses administered in this study, did not prevent the complications of cirrhosis or improve the survival of these patients.
