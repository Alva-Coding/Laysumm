TITLE

Caspase recruitment domain 6 protects against hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury by suppressing ASK1

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is an important cause of liver damage that occurs during surgical procedures, including liver tumor resection and liver transplantation.1

During this process, the initial hypoxic insult causes direct cellular damage, while the subsequent return of blood flow further aggravates liver dysfunction and injury due to the propagation of inflammation.

The mechanism underlying the propagation of the inflammatory response and further tissue damage involves a complex interplay of cytokines/chemokines, multiple cell types, and various signaling pathways.2,3

Identification of pivotal regulators controlling this process and elucidation of the underlying mechanisms are essential for the development of novel strategies for clinical intervention of hepatic I/R injury.

PARAGRAPH

Caspase recruitment domain family member 6 (CARD6) is a typical member of CARD domain-containing proteins, which are generally involved in processes related to inflammation and apoptosis.4

CARD domains usually mediate the formation of large protein complexes via direct interactions with individual CARD domains.

CARD6 has been shown to interact with microtubules and localizes in the cytosol.5

CARD6 also interacts with other members of the CARD family, such as receptor-interacting protein kinases 2 (RIPK2), and positively modulates signal transduction pathways converging on the activation of NF-κB.5

CARD6 has also been associated with the activation of the NF-κB pathway in cancers and may play a role in the development of gastrointestinal cancers.6

Paradoxically, other studies showed that CARD6 suppressed NF-κB activation by NOD1 or RIPK2 but did not interfere with NF-κB activation by BCL10 or TNFα.7

Furthermore, an in vivo study demonstrated that CARD6 was induced by interferon and that CARD6-deficient mice did not exhibit abnormalities in signaling pathways mediating innate and adaptive immune responses, including the NOD pathways.8

Interestingly, pressure overload upregulated CARD6 that protected against cardiac hypertrophy by suppressing mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) kinase-1-dependent MEK-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2) activation.9

Thus, the pathophysiological function of CARD6 is still unclear.

In addition, pathways proximal to CARD6 resulting in its activation have not been characterized and its associated signaling complexes remain obscure.

Considering the critical roles of the NF-κB and JNK signaling pathways in causing inflammation and cell death, CARD6 may regulate these processes and play a role in hepatic I/R injury.

PARAGRAPH

In our preliminary study, we observed that CARD6 was significantly downregulated in human livers for transplantation and mouse livers subjected to hepatic I/R operation, suggesting a potential role of CARD6 in this process.

Our in vivo and in vitro studies showed that CARD6 reduced liver damage, ameliorated cell death, and dampened inflammation in hepatic I/R injury.

CARD6 did so by binding to and quenching ASK1 signaling.

Our study identified ASK1 as a novel signaling partner of CARD6 and highlighted CARD6 as a pivotal regulator in hepatic I/R injury.

Animals and treatment

PARAGRAPH

Card6-floxed mice (the fourth exon of the Card6 gene is floxed by two loxP sites, C57BL/6J background) (Card6flox/+) were created using the CRISPR/Cas9 system.10

Card6flox/flox mice were generated by self-mating Card6flox/+.

Card6flox/+ mice were also mated to Alb-Cre mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) to select Card6flox/+;Alb-Cre genotype.

Card6flox/+;Alb-Cre were further crossed to Card6flox/flox mice to select Card6flox/flox;Alb-Cre.

Hepatocyte-specific knockout of Card6 (Card6-HKO) in Card6flox/flox;Alb-Cre mice was confirmed by western blot (Fig. 2A).

Card6 transgenic mice were also created by microinjecting a construct containing full-length Card6 cDNA inserted after the CAG-loxP-CAT-loxP cassette into fertilized C57BL/6J embryos.

The transgenic mice were further crossed with Alb-Cre mice to obtain double transgenic mice.

Hepatocyte-specific overexpression of Card6 (Card6-HTG) was verified by western blot (Fig. 2E).

PARAGRAPH

Only 8- to 10-week-old male mice (24–27 g) were used, and all mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions with controlled temperature and 12 h light/dark cycle.

Mouse hepatic I/R injury model

PARAGRAPH

Partial hepatic ischemia was induced as previously described.11

Mice were free to access to food and water before surgery.

In brief, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg).

A midline laparotomy was performed, and an atraumatic clip (Fine Science Tools, North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) was placed across the portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct to interrupt blood supply to the left lateral/median lobes (∼70%) of the liver.

After 60 min of partial hepatic ischemia, the clamp was removed to initiate reperfusion.

Sham control mice underwent the same protocol without vascular occlusion.

Mice were sacrificed at the indicated periods of reperfusion, and serum and tissue samples were collected for analyses.

Results

SECTION

CARD6 downregulation is closely related to hepatic I/R injury

PARAGRAPH

There exist controversial reports regarding the effect of CARD6 on NF-κB activation.5,7

Considering the critical role of NF-κB signaling in hepatic I/R injury, the effect of CARD6 on NF-κB signaling could potentially be translated to an affect in this pathological process.

Indeed, we observed significant CARD6 downregulation in human liver transplantation samples compared with control liver biopsies from healthy individuals (Fig. 1A).

CARD6 downregulation at both the protein and the mRNA levels was verified in mouse livers subjected to hepatic I/R operation (Fig. 1B and C).

Moreover, primary hepatocytes from wild-type (WT) mice subjected to H/R treatment also exhibited decreased CARD6 protein levels compared with control hepatocytes (Fig. 1D).

These observations suggest that CARD6 downregulation in hepatocytes is closely related to hepatic I/R injury and may play a role in this process.

SECTION

CARD6 ameliorates liver damage induced by hepatic I/R insult

PARAGRAPH

To explore the in vivo function of CARD6 in hepatic I/R injury, we generated Card6 knockout mice with Card6 deletion specifically in hepatocytes (HKO) and Card6 transgenic mice with CARD6 overexpression specifically in hepatocytes (HTG).

Card6-HKO mice showed specific CARD6 deficiency in livers and hepatocytes (Fig. 2A) and Card6 knockout did not cause liver damage under sham conditions (Fig. 2B).

As expected, hepatic I/R caused liver damage in both WT and Card6-HKO mice, as evidenced by elevated serum ALT and AST activities (Fig. 2B).

Notably, Card6-HKO mice exhibited higher ALT and AST activities than WT mice (Fig. 2B).

Histological analysis of the livers also demonstrated an increased necrotic area and Suzuki’s score in Card6-HKO mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 2C and D).

By contrast, Card6-HTG mice showed specific upregulation in livers and hepatocytes (Fig. 2E) and CARD6 overexpression did not affect basal liver damage under sham conditions (Fig. 2F).

Sustained CARD6 expression in Card6-HTG mice reduced ALT and AST activities in the serum and the necrotic area and Suzuki’s liver score compared with that of non-transgenic mice (NTG) (Fig. 2F–H).

These observations suggest that CARD6 plays a protective role in hepatic I/R injury.

SECTION

CARD6 alleviates inflammation in hepatic I/R injury

PARAGRAPH

Hepatic I/R insult causes the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines that in turn worsen inflammation.

We further tested whether CARD6 could affect the production of inflammation in hepatic I/R injury.

Under sham conditions, Card6 knockout did not affect basal inflammation.

However, CARD6 deficiency significantly increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1 and CXCL-1, in the serum and elevated mRNA levels of these cytokines/chemokines in the livers compared with those of WT mice after hepatic I/R (Fig. 3A-B).

The elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production of TNF-α, MCP-1 and CXCL-1 were also confirmed in the medium collected from primary Card6-HKO hepatocyte cultures after H/R treatment (Fig. 3C).

Furthermore, I/R-treated Card6-HKO livers exhibited aggravated infiltration of neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and T cells compared with WT livers while no different or undetectable infiltration was found in sham-treated livers from WT and Card6-HKO (Fig. 3D-E, Fig. S1A).

The activation of p65, a critical regulator of inflammation, was also enhanced by CARD6 deficiency after hepatic I/R operation or H/R treatment, as shown by increased phosphorylation of IKKβ and p65 and decreased total IκBα (Fig. 3F).

By contrast, sustained CARD6 expression weakened I/R-induced inflammation.

Upon hepatic I/R operation, the Card6-HTG mice showed decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in the serum, reduced infiltration of immune cells into the livers, and ameliorated p65 signaling compared with control NTG mice (Fig. 4A–F).

Again, CARD6 overexpression did not affect basal inflammation and immune cell infiltration under sham conditions (Fig. 4A–F, Fig. S1B).

These results suggest that CARD6 suppresses inflammation in hepatic I/R injury.

SECTION

CARD6 promotes hepatocyte survival in hepatic I/R injury

PARAGRAPH

Excessive inflammation eventually causes extensive liver cell death, leading to hepatic I/R injury.

Therefore, we further tested whether CARD6 could prevent this vicious cycle in hepatic I/R injury.

As expected, hepatic I/R operation caused apoptosis in both livers as shown by TUNEL assays, and CARD6 deficiency worsened apoptosis (Fig. 5A).

In addition, WT and Card6-HKO livers showed undetectable TUNEL signal under sham conditions (Fig. S1C).

Card6-HKO primary hepatocytes also exhibited elevated LDH in the medium collected from hepatocyte cultures subjected to H/R treatment (Fig. 5B).

Consistent with these results, the pro-survival gene Bcl2 was reduced and the pro-apoptotic gene Bax was increased at both the mRNA and protein levels in Card6-HKO livers compared with those of WT mice (Fig. 5C-D).

Furthermore, increased activation of the caspase 3 as the executioner caspase was observed in Card6-HKO livers and primary hepatocytes (Fig. 5D).

By contrast, sustained CARD6 expression in Card6-HTG mice efficiently suppressed cell death, as evidenced by fewer positive cells in TUNEL assays, reduced LDH release, less mature caspase 3 and decreased BAX but increased BCL-2 expression (Fig. 5E-H).

Again, WT and Card6-HTG livers showed undetectable apoptosis under sham conditions (Fig. 5E–H, Fig. S1D).

These observations demonstrated that CARD6 inhibited cell death and promoted cell survival in hepatic I/R injury.

SECTION

CARD6 inhibits JNK and p38 signaling by suppressing ASK1 in hepatic I/R injury

PARAGRAPH

CARD6 was previously reported to suppress JNK signaling, which plays critical roles in hepatic I/R injury.9

Therefore, we explored whether CARD6 modulated JNK signaling in hepatic I/R injury.

CARD6 deficiency or overexpression did not affect basal JNK and p38 signaling under sham conditions whereas hepatic I/R activated ERK, JNK, and p38 in both livers (Fig. 6A).

Interestingly, CARD6 deficiency further elevated JNK and p38 phosphorylation, while CARD6 upregulation normalized JNK and p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 6A).

In both settings, ERK phosphorylation was not affected.

These results were confirmed in primary hepatocyte cultures subjected to H/R treatment (Fig. 6B).

PARAGRAPH

It is well established that multiple factors affect the hepatic I/R injury.

Complex interplay of cytokines/chemokines and various signaling pathways propagates the inflammatory response and ultimately causes liver injury.

However, it is difficult to dissect which effects precede injury as opposed to being a consequence of injury.

To address this, WT and Card6-HKO hepatocytes were treated with H/R for different durations (Fig. S2A-B).

JNK and p38 appeared to be activated at hypoxia stage while p65 signaling, BCL2 expression and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 were not significantly altered compared with control.

Notably, Card6-HKO hepatocytes exhibited enhanced JNK and p38 signaling compared to WT hepatocytes at this stage.

In re-oxygenation stage, JNK, p38 and NF-κB signaling were all increased and coincided with decreased expression of BCL-2 and increased production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 in both WT and Card6-HKO hepatocytes compared to the hypoxia stage.

Again, Card6-HKO hepatocytes exhibited a worse phenotype compared to WT hepatocytes at re-oxygenation stage.

H/R-treated Card6-HKO hepatocytes showed enhanced JNK, p38 and NF-κB signaling, and decreased BCL2 expression as well as increased expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 compared to H/R-treated WT hepatocytes.

These findings are consistent with results after 24 h of reperfusion and 12 h re-oxygenation.

PARAGRAPH

ASK1 and TAK1 are two upstream kinases that activate MAPK signaling in hepatic I/R injury.

We further explored whether CARD6 repressed JNK and p38 signaling by modulating these upstream kinases.

Again, CARD6 deficiency or overexpression did not affect basal ASK1 phosphorylation at threonine 845, the activation marker for ASK1, under sham conditions.

CARD6 deficiency enhanced ASK1 phosphorylation but not TAK1 in response to hepatic I/R operation or H/R treatment, whereas CARD6 overexpression suppressed ASK1 phosphorylation without affecting TAK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 6C and D).

These results suggest that CARD6 may regulate JNK and p38 signaling by inhibiting ASK1 activation.

PARAGRAPH

To demonstrate whether ASK1 mediated CARD6 function in hepatic I/R injury, we knocked down or overexpressed ASK1 in Card6-HKO or Card6-HTG primary hepatocytes, respectively.

ASK1 knockdown completely abrogated the enhanced activation of p38, JNK, and p65 induced by CARD6 deficiency (Fig. 6E).

By contrast, ectopic expression of ASK1 antagonized the suppressive effect of CARD6 overexpression and restored the activation of these signaling pathways (Fig. 6E).

To further address the role of ASK1 in CARD6 function in hepatic I/R injury, we crossed the Card6-HKO mice with dnAsk1 transgenic mice with liver specific overexpression to generate dnAsk1/Card6-HKO mice and performed hepatic I/R operation in WT, Card6-HKO, dnAsk1, and dnAsk1/Card6-HKO mice.

As expected, Card6-HKO mice showed increased liver damage evidenced by increased BAX, decreased BCL2 and pro-Caspase3 compared with WT mice.

Impressively, hepatic overexpression of dnAsk1 completely abrogated BAX expression and normalized BCL2 and pro-Caspase3 expression (Fig. S3A–C).

These observations are consistent with our findings showing that ASK1 knockdown reversed NF-κB signaling, BCL-2 expression and MAPK signaling in Card6-HKO hepatocytes (Fig. 6E).

These results strongly suggest that ASK1 mediates CARD6 function in hepatic I/R injury.

SECTION

CARD6 directly interacts with ASK1

PARAGRAPH

To determine how CARD6 affects ASK1 signaling, we first performed co-IP to detect the interaction of CARD6 and ASK1.

CARD6 was readily detected in the ASK1 immunocomplex, and ASK1 could also be detected in the CARD6 immunocomplex (Fig. 7A).

Moreover, His-tagged ASK1 protein efficiently pulled down HA-tagged CARD6, and His-tagged CARD6 pulled down HA-tagged ASK1 (Fig. 7B).

Co-IP using serially truncated forms of ASK1 or CARD6 demonstrated that the CARD6 segment from amino acid 281 to 480 and the catalytic domain (from amino acid 679 to 936) of Ask1 mediated the interaction between CARD6 and ASK1 (Fig. 7C).

Thus, we generated a mutant Card6 (Card6-M) with a deletion from amino acid 281 to 480 that lost the ability to interact with ASK1 (Fig. 7D).

SECTION

Interaction with ASK1 is required for CARD6 function in hepatic I/R injury

PARAGRAPH

We further investigated whether CARD6 interaction with ASK1 was required for the protective effect of CARD6 in hepatic I/R injury.

In vitro, ASK1 phosphorylation was inhibited by WT CARD6 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas Card6-M failed to suppress ASK1 phosphorylation in response to H/R treatment (Fig. 8A).

In vivo, adenovirus-mediated Card6-M overexpression in livers failed to suppress ASK1 activation, in contrast to the effects of WT Card6 (Fig. 8B).

Consistent with these findings, Card6-M failed to protect against liver damage as shown by its failure to decrease ALT and AST activities in the serum and to reduce the necrotic area and Suzuki’s score in liver histology analysis (Fig. 8C–E).

Moreover, Card6-M failed to decrease LDH release (Fig. 8F) and did not repress the activation of p38, JNK and IKKβ, while failing to restore BCL-2 expression (Fig. 8G).

Taken together, these results suggest that interaction with ASK1 is indispensable for CARD6-mediated protection against hepatic I/R injury.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The in vivo function of CARD6 in inflammation and immune signaling remains unclear.

One study showed normal innate and adaptive immune responses in CARD6-deficient mice.8

In a recent report, CARD6 was shown to protect against cardiac hypertrophy by interrupting ERK1/2, JNK1/2 activation.9

In our study, we showed that CARD6 downregulation was closely related to hepatic I/R injury.

CARD6 efficiently protected against hepatic I/R injury by reducing the production of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, ameliorating immune cell infiltration, dampening NF-κB signaling, and decreasing cell death.

The mechanistic studies demonstrated that CARD6 suppressed JNK and p38 signaling pathways by inhibiting the upstream kinase ASK1 but not TAK1.

Moreover, CARD6 directly interacted with ASK1, which is indispensable for CARD6 function.

Our results clearly demonstrate that CARD6 is a protective regulator in hepatic I/R injury.

PARAGRAPH

CARD6 contains a caspase recruitment domain, which is an interaction motif found in a wide array of proteins.

Typically, these proteins are involved in multiple processes relating to inflammation and apoptosis.4

The CARD domains usually trigger the formation of multiple-protein activation complexes via direct interaction with other CARD domain-containing proteins.

However, accumulating studies have demonstrated that these molecules may also function through CARD-independent mechanisms.

For example, the CARD domain of CARD6 suppressed its interaction with RIPK2, and mutant CARD6 without the CARD domain effectively enhanced RIPK2-induced NF-κB activities.5

Our studies further showed that the CARD6 interaction with ASK1 did not require the CARD domain (Fig. 7C).

Moreover, Card6-M, which retained the CARD domain but lost the ASK1-interacting segment, failed to protect against hepatic I/R injury.

Our study revealed unique features of CARD6 that are distinct from other members of the CARD family.

PARAGRAPH

Conflicting roles of CARD6 in NF-κB signaling have been reported.

An initial in vitro study showed that CARD6 protein suppressed activation of NF-κB by NOD1 or RIPK2 but did not interfere with activation of NF-κB by BCL-10 or TNF-α.7,9

A following study demonstrated a positive role of CARD6 in NF-κB activation.5

However, an in vivo study from the same group showed that CARD6 did not promote NOD-induced NF-κB activation.6

In their study, CARD6 was induced by interferon but was not involved in NOD-induced NF-κB activation.

Furthermore, Card6 knockout and WT mice exhibited comparable susceptibility to bacterial and viral infection.

In our study, Card6-HKO and Card6-HTG mice did not show altered NF-κB signaling at the basal level.

However, Card6-HKO mice did exhibit enhanced hepatic I/R-induced NF-κB activation, while sustained CARD6 expression abrogated NF-κB activation.

These observations indicate that CARD6 is a suppressor of inflammation and NF-κB signaling in vivo in response to hepatic I/R.

These distinct phenotypes of CARD6 deficiency may be attributed to different pathophysiological stimuli.

Under these distinct circumstances, CARD6 may bind to different partners to exert various functions.

Indeed, we identified ASK1 as a novel partner of CARD6 (Fig. 7).

ASK1 has been shown to sense different stresses; regulate multiple downstream signaling pathways, including NF-κB, MAPK/JNK, and MAPK/p38; and play important roles in various pathological conditions.17–20

We further showed that CARD6 targeted ASK1 to repress the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways.

ASK1 downregulation abrogated enhanced phosphorylation of p38, JNK, and NF-κB by CARD6 deficiency, whereas ASK1 upregulation abolished the suppressive effect of CARD6 on these signaling pathways.

Thus, we identified CARD6 as an efficient regulator of ASK1 signaling in response to hepatic I/R.

PARAGRAPH

Our study further demonstrated that the CARD6/ASK1 axis might be a novel target for clinical intervention of hepatic I/R injury.

A recent study showed that ASK1 suppression by c-FLIP effectively ameliorated non-alcohol steatohepatitis in mice and monkeys.21

Notably, a small segment of c-FLIP interfering with ASK1 dimerization effectively attenuated the progression of steatohepatitis and metabolic disorders in these animals.

In our study, we showed that CARD6 interacted with the catalytic domain of ASK1 and inhibited ASK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7).

Furthermore, Card6-M that lacked the ability to interact with ASK1 failed to suppress ASK1 phosphorylation and protect against hepatic I/R injury in vivo.

These observations demonstrate that ASK1 is a novel target of CARD6.

The suppression of ASK1 is important to CARD6-mediated protection against hepatic I/R injury.

Thus, targeting CARD6/ASK1 is a novel strategy for clinical intervention of hepatic I/R injury.

PARAGRAPH

Our study may contribute to the development of specific ASK1 inhibitors.

It is of interest to test whether CARD6 (281-480) alone is sufficient to block ASK1 phosphorylation, similar to c-Flip.21

Fine mapping may identify the minimum sequences of CARD6 and ASK1 that are required for the interaction and help dissect the underlying mechanism of whether a CARD6 segment directly blocks the catalytic site of ASK1.

The minimum sequence of CARD6 may potentially serve as a specific peptide inhibitor to block ASK1 kinase activity.

Further analysis of the structure of the ASK1 catalytic domain binding to CARD6 (241-480) may provide more information for structure-based target drug design for ASK1.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, we have identified CARD6 as a novel protective regulator in hepatic I/R injury.

CARD6 targets ASK1 to modulate multiple signaling pathways.

Our study provides experimental evidence that supports inhibition of ASK1 as a novel strategy for clinical intervention of hepatic I/R injury.
