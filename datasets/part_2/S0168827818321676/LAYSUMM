TITLE

Caspase recruitment domain 6 protects against hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury by suppressing ASK1

PARAGRAPH

The protein CARD6 plays an important role during the process of liver blood flow restriction (ischemia) and restoration (reperfusion).

By suppressing the activity of ASK1, CARD6 can protect against hepatocyte injury.

Targeting CARD6 is a potential strategy for prevention and treatment of ischemia/reperfusion injury.
