ABSTRACT

TITLE

Real-world effectiveness of 8-week treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in chronic hepatitis C

PARAGRAPH

Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) for 8 to 24 weeks is approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection (HCV).

In the ION-3 study, 8 weeks of LDV/SOF was non-inferior to 12 weeks in previously untreated genotype 1 (GT1) patients without cirrhosis.

According to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), 8-week treatment may be considered in na√Øve non-cirrhotic GT1-patients.

However, there are only limited data on the effectiveness of an 8-week regimen of LDV/SOF under real-world conditions.

The aim of the present study was to characterise patients receiving 8 weeks of LDV/SOF compared to those receiving 12 weeks of LDV/SOF, and to describe therapeutic outcomes in routine clinical practice.

PARAGRAPH

The German Hepatitis C-Registry is a large national real-world cohort that analyses effectiveness and safety of antiviral therapies in chronic HCV.

This data set is based on 2,404 patients.

Treatment with SOF/LDV (without RBV) for 8 or 12 weeks was initiated on or before September 30, 2015.

PARAGRAPH

Overall, 84.6% (2,034/2,404) of the safety population (intention-to-treat-1 [ITT1]) and 98.2% (2,029/2,066) of the per protocol (PP) population achieved sustained virological response at week 12 (SVR12).

In the 8-week group, 85.1% (824/968) of ITT1 and 98.3% (821/835) of PP patients achieved SVR12, while in the 12-week group, 85.5% (1,210/1,415) of ITT1, and 98.1% (1,208/1,231) of PP patients achieved SVR12.

When treated according to the SmPC, 98.7% (739/749) of the patients achieved SVR12 (PP).

Relapse was observed in 9.5% (2/21) of cirrhotic patients treated for 8 weeks (PP).

PARAGRAPH

Under real-world conditions a high proportion of eligible patients receiving 8-week LDV/SOF treatment achieved SVR12.

Relapse occurred more frequently in patients who did not meet the selection criteria according to the SmPC.
