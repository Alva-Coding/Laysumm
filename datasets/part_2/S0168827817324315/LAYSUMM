TITLE

Real-world effectiveness of 8-week treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in chronic hepatitis C

PARAGRAPH

In a large real-world cohort of patients mainly treated by physicians in private practice in Germany, shorter HCV treatment (8-week) resulted in equivalent cure rates to 12-week treatment in genotype 1 HCV-infected patients.

Thus, shorter treatment can be recommended in these patients which would substantially reduce costs of therapy.
