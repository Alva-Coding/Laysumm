TITLE

Reliability of a single-region sample to evaluate tumor immune microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma

PARAGRAPH

Heterogeneity in the regional immune microenvironments of tumors has been reported in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

This heterogeneity could be an obstacle when trying to reliably evaluate the immune microenvironment of an entire tumor using only a single-region tumor sample, which may be the only option in patients with more advanced disease.

Our study utilized both immunohistochemical and transcriptomic analyses to demonstrate that a single-region sample is reliable for evaluation of tumor immune microenvironments in 60â€“70% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
