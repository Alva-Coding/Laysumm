TITLE

Family occurrence of autoimmune hepatitis: A Danish nationwide registry-based cohort study

PARAGRAPH

Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic liver disease caused by a dysfunctional immune system.

It is widely believed that autoimmune hepatitis accumulates in families.

We studied the family members of patients with autoimmune hepatitis from the entire Danish population.

We found that autoimmune hepatitis does accumulate in families, but the risk of autoimmune hepatitis in the family members is very low.
