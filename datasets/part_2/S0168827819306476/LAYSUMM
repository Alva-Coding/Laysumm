TITLE

Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8 weeks in treatment-naïve patients with chronic HCV genotypes 1–6 and compensated cirrhosis: The EXPEDITION-8 trial

PARAGRAPH

This study was the first to evaluate an 8-week direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen active against all major types of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in untreated patients with compensated cirrhosis.

High virological cure rates were achieved with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir across HCV genotypes 1–6, and these high cure rates did not depend on any patient or viral characteristics present before treatment.

This may simplify care and allow non-specialist healthcare professionals to treat these patients, contributing to global efforts to eliminate HCV.
