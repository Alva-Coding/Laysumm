ABSTRACT

TITLE

Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8 weeks in treatment-naïve patients with chronic HCV genotypes 1–6 and compensated cirrhosis: The EXPEDITION-8 trial

PARAGRAPH

Eight-week glecaprevir/pibrentasvir leads to high rates of sustained virological response at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12) across HCV genotypes (GT) 1–6 in treatment-naïve patients without cirrhosis.

We evaluated glecaprevir/pibrentasvir once daily for 8 weeks in treatment-naïve patients with compensated cirrhosis.

PARAGRAPH

EXPEDITION-8 was a single-arm, multicenter, phase IIIb trial.

The primary and key secondary efficacy analyses were to compare the lower bound of the 95% CI of the SVR12 rate in i) patients with GT1,2,4–6 in the per protocol (PP) population, ii) patients with GT1,2,4–6 in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, iii) patients with GT1–6 in the PP population, and iv) patients with GT1–6 in the ITT population, to pre-defined efficacy thresholds based on historical SVR12 rates for 12 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in the same populations.

Safety was also assessed.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 343 patients were enrolled.

Most patients were male (63%), white (83%), and had GT1 (67%).

The SVR12 rate in patients with GT1–6 was 99.7% (n/N = 334/335; 95% CI 98.3–99.9) in the PP population and 97.7% (n/N = 335/343; 95% CI 96.1–99.3) in the ITT population.

All primary and key secondary efficacy analyses were achieved.

One patient (GT3a) experienced relapse (0.3%) at post-treatment week 4.

Common adverse events (≥5%) were fatigue (9%), pruritus (8%), headache (8%), and nausea (6%).

Serious adverse events (none related) occurred in 2% of patients.

No adverse event led to study drug discontinuation.

Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were infrequent.

PARAGRAPH

Eight-week glecaprevir/pibrentasvir was well tolerated and led to a similarly high SVR12 rate as the 12-week regimen in treatment-naïve patients with chronic HCV GT1–6 infection and compensated cirrhosis.
