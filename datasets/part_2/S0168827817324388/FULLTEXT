TITLE

Antiviral therapy improves survival in patients with HBV infection and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma undergoing liver resection

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) accounts for 10%–20% of primary liver cancer, with an incidence second only to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).1

In addition, the incidence and related mortality of ICC are dramatically increasing worldwide.1,2

Currently, liver resection (LR) is the only established treatment to achieve possible long-term survival for patients with ICC,1,3 with an associated five-year survival ranging from 26.4% to 35.2%.4,5

The poor long-term outcomes following resection are related to the aggressive and invasive nature of this malignancy.6,7

PARAGRAPH

There are multiple risk factors associated with the development of ICC.1

Specifically, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are important risk factors for the disease,8–10 with HBV infection being more prevalent in Asia and other high incidence regions of ICC.8,9

A recent meta-analysis demonstrated a close association between the incidence of HBV infection and occurrence of ICC (odds ratio [OR] 3.17; 95% CI 1.88–5.34).8

Unfortunately, knowledge on the underlying mechanism(s) of this association is still limited.

It is possible that HBV x protein (HBx) acts as a trans-activating protein by binding to nuclear transcription factors to stimulate the intracellular signaling pathways that promote tumor cell growth.11

HBV infection may also induce liver progenitor cell activation, which when accompanied by abnormal genetic changes caused by HBx activation, contributes to malignant transformation.12

PARAGRAPH

The association between HBV infection and outcomes after surgical and systemic treatments has been reported in HBV-infected patients with HCC or other malignancies.13–16

In contrast, the impact of HBV infection on outcomes following resection of ICC has not been reported.

While both ICC and HCC typically present as an intrahepatic mass, these cancers are distinct in their carcinogenesis, natural history, morphology, pathology and response to therapy.17

As such, the objective of the current study was to examine the impact of HBV-DNA level and antiviral therapy (AVT) on short- and long-term prognoses in patients with ICC who had underlying HBV infection and underwent LR.

SECTION

Patients and methods

SECTION

Patients

PARAGRAPH

Data of consecutive patients with positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or HBV core antibody (HBcAb) who underwent LR for histologically confirmed ICC between January 2006 and December 2011 at the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital (Shanghai) and the Mengchao Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital (Fuzhou) were prospectively collected and retrospectively reviewed.

The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committees of the two hospitals and informed consent was obtained from each patient to use their data for research purposes.

PARAGRAPH

Routine preoperative examination included HBV antigen/antibody, HCV antibody (HCV-Ab), liver and renal function tests, prothrombin time (PT), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and α-fetoprotein.

The serum HBV-DNA level was quantified by PCR (ABI 7300, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with a quantification linear range from 200 to 2,000,000 IU/ml.

Imaging studies included chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, and contrast-enhanced computerized tomography scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen.

Positron emission tomography or scintigraphy was carried out in patients with a clinical suspicion of tumor recurrence/metastasis.

A preoperative diagnosis of ICC was made based on the combination of clinical and radiological findings.1

PARAGRAPH

Patients were recommended for LR if they had good general performance, Child-Pugh grade A or B7 liver function, technically resectable tumors and sufficient estimated volumes of future liver remnant, and did not have evidences of distant metastasis.

Major hepatectomy was defined as resection of three or more Couinaud segments, while minor hepatectomy as two or less segments.

Regional lymph nodes were dissected for either preoperatively or intra-operatively diagnosed ICC as previously reported.5,7

Direct invasion of adjacent structures and unsuspected intrahepatic nodules identified only intra-operatively were removed whenever possible.

Histopathological study of the surgical specimens was conducted independently by three pathologists who came to a consensus if there was any controversy.

The histopathological diagnosis of ICC was mainly based on the 2000 and 2010 versions of the World Health Organization classification.

Combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinomas were excluded based on histological presence of components of both ICC and HCC which were intimately mixed within the same tumor nodule, and positive expressions of biomarkers of both ICC and HCC detected within the corresponding components on immunochemical staining.18–20

An R0 resection was defined as complete removal of macroscopic nodules and absence of microscopic disease at the surgical margin.21

Peri-operative complications and mortality within 90 days from the operation were observed and morbidity was classified as grade I-V based on the Clavien-Dindo system.22

SECTION

Study populations

PARAGRAPH

A double step protocol was adopted during patient enrollment (Fig. S1).

To analyze specific surgical morbidities including postoperative viral reactivation, hepatitis and liver failure (PLF), we excluded patients who received preoperative anti-cancer treatment including transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), ablation, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, had incomplete data on HBV infection, and who were lost to follow-up within 90 days after surgery.

All enrolled patients comprised the “short-term cohort” of the study.

Additionally, in order to analyze the long-term outcomes after surgery, a “long-term cohort” was established by excluding some of the patients from the “short-term cohort” if they had a history of other malignancy, received a non-R0 resection, had major portal/hepatic vein invasion and distant extrahepatic metastasis.

SECTION

Definitions

PARAGRAPH

Postoperative viral reactivation, hepatitis and postoperative liver failure (PLF) were diagnosed according to previously reported criteria.15,16,23

Briefly, viral reactivation was defined as an increase of ≥10-fold in viral level from the baseline level or a viral level increase to a level of ≥200 IU/ml in a patient with a previously stable or undetectable level within 90 days of the operation.15,16

Postoperative hepatitis was defined as a significant and sustained increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level after surgery.

The increase in ALT by <3xupper limit of normal ([ULN] ≤40 IU/L) was defined as mild, 3–5xULN as moderate, and >5xULN as severe postoperative hepatitis.16

PLF was defined using the “50–50” criterion on postoperative day five, with a PT of <50% and a serum total bilirubin of >50 μmol/L.23

PARAGRAPH

The definition of AVT required the patients to receive at least one kind of medication for three consecutive months that was similar to previous studies on HBV-related patients with HCC.13

Nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) including lamivudine (100 mg per day, GlaxoSmithKline), adefovir (10 mg per day, GlaxoSmithKline), telbivudine (600 mg per day, Novartis) and entecavir (0.5 mg per day, Sino-American Squibb), as well as interferon alfa (conventional five MIU thrice weekly, 3SBio Inc; pegylated 180 μg once weekly, Roche) were used in this study.

SECTION

Follow-up and endpoints

PARAGRAPH

Patients underwent follow-up once every two months in the first two years after discharge and then once every three to six months thereafter.

The follow-up regimen, diagnosis and treatment of tumor recurrence were similar to the management reported previously.5

A clear explanation of the need for any long-term medication and the need to discontinue medication for any reason was given to all the patients who received AVT.

On each follow-up visit the usage of medication was verified to assess drug resistance and side effects and to adjust medications.

PARAGRAPH

The endpoints of the study were overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and time to recurrence (TTR).

OS was measured from the date of LR to the date of patient death or the last follow-up.

CSS was measured from the date of LR to the date of ICC-related death.

TTR was calculated from the date of LR to the date when recurrence/metastasis was diagnosed.

Surgical morbidity including viral postoperative reactivation, hepatitis and PLF were also observed.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Statistical analysis was performed using the R statistical package v.3.2.1 (http://www.r-project.org/).

Continuous data were expressed as median (2.5th to 97.5th percentiles) and compared using the Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney U test.

Categorical data were compared using the Pearson’s Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate.

A viral level of 2,000 IU/ml was used as the cut-off value to determine the high or low viral level.24,25

PARAGRAPH

Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent risk factors for HBV reactivation.

Survival was evaluated using a proportional hazards regression model adjusted for potential confounders.

Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to assess the impact of AVT on recurrence and survival after adjustment for potential prognostic variables that included age, sex, serum levels of CA19-9 and CEA, tumor diameter, tumor number, histological subtype, nodal status, tumor direct invasion of adjacent organs and structures, viral reactivation, type of LR and blood transfusion.

To ensure that immortal person-time bias was not introduced by AVT patients who received therapy after LR, AVT was treated as a time-dependent variable.

A p <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Results

SECTION

Baseline clinicopathological characteristics

PARAGRAPH

There were 1,064 consecutive patients who had an HBV infection and underwent LR for histologically proven ICC.

Based on the double step inclusion criteria, 928 and 763 patients formed the “short-term cohort” and the “long-term cohort” to analyze surgical morbidity and long-term survival outcomes, respectively (Fig. S1).

PARAGRAPH

The median age of the 928 patients in the short-term cohort was 55.0 (2.5th to 97.5th percentiles: 35.0–61.0) years, among whom 658 (70.9%) were male, 126 (13.6%) were HBeAg positive, 309 (33.3%) had an HBV-DNA level of ≥2,000 IU/ml, 251 (27.0%) had cirrhosis, 233 (25.1%) had multiple tumors, 350 (37.7%) had cholangiolar type tumor, 278 (30.0%) underwent major resection, and 177 (19.1%) required blood transfusion.

The median tumor diameter was 5.6 (1.8–8.0) cm, and the median operation time was two (1.0–2.5) hours (Table 1).

Surgical complications occurred in 277 (29.8%) patients, with grade I/II, III/IV and V complications in 162 (17.5%), 93 (10.0%) and 22 (2.4%) patients, respectively (Table S1).

The long-term cohort had similar baseline characteristics to the short-term cohort (Table 1).

SECTION

Viral reactivation, postoperative hepatitis and liver failure

PARAGRAPH

Among the short-term cohort of 928 patients, 123 received preoperative AVT (the preoperative AVT group).

Among the 805 patients who did not receive AVT, 576 had a low viral level (<2,000 IU/ml, the no-preoperative AVT-low group), while the other 229 had a high level (≥2,000 IU/ml, the no-preoperative AVT-high group).24,25

PARAGRAPH

Viral reactivation developed in 88 (9.5%) patients, occurring in 4 (3.3%), 48 (8.3%) and 36 (15.7%) patients in the preoperative AVT, no-preoperative AVT-low and no-preoperative AVT-high groups, respectively (p <0.001).

Among 169 (18.2%) patients who had postoperative hepatitis, 10 (8.1%), 99 (17.2%) and 60 (26.2%) were in these three groups, respectively (p = 0.002), with 6 (4.9%), 53 (9.2%) and 32 (14.0%) having mild hepatitis (p <0.001), 3 (2.4%), 40 (6.9%) and 22 (9.6%) moderate hepatitis (p <0.001), and 1 (0.8%), 6 (1.0%) and 6 (2.6%) severe hepatitis (p = 0.119) in these three groups, respectively.

PLF happened in 45 (4.8%) patients, with 1 (0.8%), 29 (5.0%) and 15 (6.6%) in these three groups, respectively (p = 0.032) (Table 2).

SECTION

Independent risk factors of viral reactivation

PARAGRAPH

Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that a viral level of ≥2,000 IU/ml (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.11–3.07), HBeAg positivity (OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.21–4.40), no-preoperative AVT (OR 6.53; 95% CI 2.19–19.44), operation time ≥3 h (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.15–3.31), hilar clamping time ≥30 min (OR 2.98; 95% CI 1.58–5.60), blood transfusion (OR 2.57; 95% CI 1.54–4.31) and adjuvant treatment (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.13–3.03) were each independently associated with viral reactivation (Table 3, Table S2).

SECTION

Impact of AVT on the long-term prognosis after liver resection

PARAGRAPH

In the long-term cohort of 763 patients, 198 received AVT (the AVT group, Table S3 details the medications).

The remaining 565 patients did not receive any AVT (the no-AVT group), among them 419 had a low viral level (the no-AVT-low group) while the other 146 had a high viral level (the no-AVT-high group) (Fig. S1).

PARAGRAPH

When compared with no-AVT-low patients (Table S4), AVT patients had younger median age (52.0 vs. 57.0 years) and smaller median tumor size (4.5 vs. 5.7 cm).

A larger proportion of AVT patients were male (77.8% vs. 63.7%), HBeAg positive (26.3% vs. 2.6%), had cirrhosis (47.5% vs. 12.9%), cholangiolar type ICC (43.4% vs. 34.4%) and a previous history of viral reactivation (14.6% vs. 5.5%), while a smaller proportion of AVT patients had multiple nodules (20.2% vs. 29.4%) and underwent major hepatectomy (19.7% vs. 31.7%) (all p ≤0.037).

There was no difference in CEA and CA19-9 levels, blood transfusion, clamp and operation time, tumor number, presence of MVI, direct invasion and nodal metastasis between both groups (all p >0.05).

Compared with no-AVT-high patients, AVT patients had smaller median tumor size (4.5 vs. 5.3 cm).

A larger proportion of AVT patients had cirrhosis (47.5% vs. 26.0%) and a smaller proportion had multiple tumors (20.2% vs. 30.8%) and direct invasion (5.1% vs. 13.0%) (all p ≤0.033).

No differences in age, sex, HBV parameters, CEA and CA19-9 levels, types of hepatectomy, transfusion, cholangiolar type of ICC, presence of MVI, nodal metastasis and viral reactivation were identified between the groups (all p >0.05).

PARAGRAPH

Follow-up was censored on August 25, 2014, with a median follow-up of 47.1 (range, 1.2 to 92.0) months.

Table S5 shows the results of univariable analysis of tumor recurrence, CSS and OS.

Multivariable analysis identified that a high viral level (hazard ratio [HR] 1.22; 95% CI 1.01–1.47) and viral reactivation (HR 1.34; 1.01–1.78) were independent risk factors, in addition to the elevated CA19-9 level, tumor >5 cm, multiple tumors, histological subtype, presence of MVI, direct invasion and nodal metastasis.

The independent risk factors for CSS and OS were similar to those of recurrence.

However, the AVT group did not have a decreased risk of tumor recurrence or patient death compared with the no-AVT group (HR 0.94; 95% CI: 0.71–1.25, p = 0.690 for recurrence; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61–1.11; p = 0.193 for CSS; HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.60–1.08; p = 0.154 for OS) (Table 4).

PARAGRAPH

However, prognostic differences were identified among the AVT, no-AVT-low and no-AVT-high groups.

The Cox-adjusted one-, three-, and five-year recurrence rates between the AVT and no-AVT-low groups were not significantly different (34.4%, 56.7% and 70.5% vs. 44.5%, 66.8% and 71.7%, respectively, p = 0.057).

However, the recurrence rates for these two groups were significantly lower than those for the no-AVT-high group (55.5%, 77.8% and 86.5%, respectively; p <0.001, p = 0.017).

The corresponding CSS rates between the AVT and no-AVT-low group were not significantly different (78.8%, 57.2% and 46.9% vs. 80.5%, 47.5% and 35.5%, respectively, p = 0.051); the CSS rates for these two groups were significantly higher than those for the no-AVT-high group (66.1%, 30.6% and 20.9%, respectively; both p <0.001).

The corresponding OS rates between the former two groups were also similar (75.5%, 53.5% and 43.0% vs. 75.5%, 44.7% and 33.5%, respectively, p = 0.060); the OS rates for the two groups were significantly higher than those for the latter group (65.4%, 30.1% and 20.5%, respectively; p <0.001, p = 0.006) (Fig. 1).

PARAGRAPH

Adjusted multivariable analysis demonstrated that the AVT and no-AVT-low groups had decreased risks of recurrence (HR 0.60 and 0.76; 95% CI 0.46–0.79 and 0.61–0.95) compared with the no-AVT-high group.

Similar results were observed in CSS (HR 0.48 and 0.63; 95% CI 0.36–0.64 and 0.49–0.81) and OS analyses (HR 0.56 and 0.71; 95% CI 0.42–0.74 and 0.56–0.91) (Table 5).

SECTION

Impact of initiation time of AVT on the long-term prognosis after liver resection

PARAGRAPH

Among the 198 AVT patients, 87 initiated AVT preoperatively and all of them continued it after LR (the pre+postoperative AVT group); the remaining 111 patients received AVT only after LR (the postoperative AVT group).

The no-AVT-high group of 146 patients was also used in this analysis (Fig. S1).

PARAGRAPH

As shown in Fig. 2, the pre+postoperative AVT and postoperative AVT groups had similar Cox-adjusted one-, three-, and five-year recurrence rates (23.3%, 46.5% and 61.7% vs. 27.9%, 52.4% and 67.2%, respectively, p = 0.330), which were significantly lower than the rates for the no-AVT-high group (54.4%, 75.9% and 84.5%, respectively; p <0.001, p = 0.001).

The corresponding CSS and OS rates between the former two groups were also similar (88.0%, 66.4% and 57.7% vs. 78.7%, 56.6% and 44.6%, p = 0.088 and 82.8%, 60.1% and 52.0% vs. 79.2%, 57.6% and 44.3%, respectively, p = 0.468).

These CSS and OS rates were significantly higher than the corresponding rates for the no-AVT-high group (67.5%, 33.6% and 24.4%, respectively, p <0.001, p = 0.008; 66.0%, 31.7% and 22.4%, respectively, p <0.001, p = 0.003).

PARAGRAPH

After adjusting for other prognostic risk factors, the risk of recurrence was decreased in the pre+postoperative and postoperative AVT groups (HR 0.44; 95% CI: 0.30–0.64, p <0.001; HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.37–0.79; p = 0.001) compared with the no-AVT-high group.

The former two groups had a similar risk of recurrence (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.53–1.24; p = 0.330).

Similar results were obtained when CSS and OS were examined (Table 5).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

In this study, postoperative viral reactivation developed in 9.5% of patients with ICC and HBV infection who underwent LR.

A high viral level and viral reactivation worsened short- and long-term surgical prognoses.

Preoperative AVT reduced the incidence of postoperative viral reactivation, hepatitis and PLF.

AVT when started either before or after LR significantly improved the long-term outcomes.

PARAGRAPH

Previous studies have demonstrated a prognostic risk of high viral level, and the oncological advantage of AVT among patients with HBV-related HCC.13,16,26

In the current study, we demonstrated that a high viral level was associated with worse surgical outcomes among HBV-infected patients with ICC, suggesting that HBV infection may play a role in both pathogenesis and prognosis among patients with ICC and HBV infection.

PARAGRAPH

Our results showed that AVT patients had better five-year recurrence, CSS and OS rates compared with no-AVT-high patients (all p <0.001 [Fig. 1]).

In addition, AVT patients seemed to have a better prognosis than the no-AVT-low patients, possibly because in the latter group about 15.3% (64/419) of patients still had viral replication (viral level: 200–2,000 IU/ml), while 98.5% (195/198) of patients in the AVT group had undetectable viral level after treatment.

However, differences in five-year recurrence, CSS and OS rates between them were insignificant (p = 0.057, 0.051 and 0.060, respectively).

PARAGRAPH

The inhibitory role of preoperative AVT on postoperative viral reactivation also contributed to better short- and long-term prognosis.

Viral reactivation developed in HBV-infected patients with HCC or other malignancies who were treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgical resection and organ transplantation, resulting in a sustained liver damage and worse long-term prognosis.16,26–29

In this study, viral reactivation occurred in 9.5% of all patients with ICC.

A preoperative viral level of ≥2,000 IU/ml, HBeAg positivity and no-preoperative AVT were independent risk factors of viral reactivation.

In addition, longer clamping time and operation time, adjuvant treatment and blood transfusion were associated with viral reactivation.

Whether the effect of these factors was associated with immunological suppression leading to post-treatment viral reactivation remains to be determined.16,30,31

Viral reactivation was also associated with worse five-year recurrence, CSS and OS rates compared with no reactivation (p = 0.041, 0.013 and 0.041 [Table 4]).

However, our results demonstrated that preoperative AVT reduced the occurrence of viral reactivation, postoperative hepatitis and PLF compared with no-preoperative AVT.

Additionally, AVT initiated before surgery was associated with better five-year recurrence, CSS and OS rates than no-AVT with a high viral level (all p <0.001 [Fig. 2]).

PARAGRAPH

Cholangiolar type ICC was reported to be more closely associated with HBV infection and to have better prognoses than bile duct type ICC.32,33

Similar results were observed in this study (Table 4).

In addition, compared with no-AVT with a high viral level, AVT decreased the risks of recurrence, cancer-specific and overall death among patients with cholangiolar type ICC (HR 0.47; 95% CI 0.30–0.73; HR 0.39; 95% CI 0.23–0.64; HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.29–0.76; all p ≤0.002).

Among patients with bile duct type ICC, the effects of AVT were identified in cancer-specific and overall death (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.41–0.84; HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.46–0.93; p = 0.003 and 0.018), but not in recurrence (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.53–1.05; p = 0.096).

However, the mechanism of AVT to improve survival in patients with ICC and HBV infection remains to be determined.

PARAGRAPH

Our results also demonstrated that AVT initiated post-operatively yielded better five-year recurrence, CSS and OS rates than those seen in no-AVT-high patients (p = 0.001, 0.008 and 0.003, respectively [Fig. 1]), and provided similar results to AVT initiated preoperatively (p = 0.330, 0.088 and 0.468, respectively [Fig. 2]).

Therefore, postoperative AVT should be considered as an important adjuvant procedure after LR for patients with ICC and HBV infection, especially for the patients who failed to receive it before surgery.

PARAGRAPH

Our study had several limitations: (i) it was not a randomized controlled trial; (ii) the indication of AVT in HBV-infected patients has progressively expanded over the past decade,24,25,34 the importance of AVT in patients with HBV-related HCC has been gradually recognized by surgeons, and the compliance of patients for AVT has gradually increased, therefore some patients did not receive AVT during the early period of this study, though they might meet the current indications for AVT;25,34 (iii) the effectiveness of NAs and interferon alfa have not been further compared because less than 5% of patients were treated with interferon alfa alone or combined with NAs; and (iv) other potential confounding factors which might have prognostic roles were not adjusted.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, preoperative AVT reduced viral reactivation and decreased related morbidity after LR for HBV-infected patients with ICC.

AVT initiated either before or after LR significantly decreased tumor recurrence and prolonged long-term survival.
