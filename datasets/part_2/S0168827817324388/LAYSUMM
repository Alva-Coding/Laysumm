TITLE

Antiviral therapy improves survival in patients with HBV infection and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma undergoing liver resection

PARAGRAPH

Postoperative hepatitis B virus reactivation was associated with an increased complication rate and a decreased survival rate after liver resection in patients with ICC and hepatitis B virus infection.

Antiviral therapy before liver resection reduced the risk of postoperative viral reactivation.

Both pre- and postoperative antiviral therapy was effective in prolonging patient survival.
