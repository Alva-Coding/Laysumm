TITLE

Integrating HCV testing with HIV programs improves hepatitis C outcomes in people who inject drugs: A cluster-randomized trial

PARAGRAPH

Delivering hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing to people who inject drugs (PWID) in places where they also have access to HIV prevention and treatment services is an effective way to improve uptake of HCV testing among communities of PWID.

To achieve the World Health Organizationâ€™s ambitious elimination targets, integrated programs will need to be scaled up to deliver comprehensive HCV services.
