ABSTRACT

TITLE

Hepatic PPARα is critical in the metabolic adaptation to sepsis

PARAGRAPH

Although the role of inflammation to combat infection is known, the contribution of metabolic changes in response to sepsis is poorly understood.

Sepsis induces the release of lipid mediators, many of which activate nuclear receptors such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α, which controls both lipid metabolism and inflammation.

We aimed to elucidate the previously unknown role of hepatic PPARα in the response to sepsis.

PARAGRAPH

Sepsis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of Escherichia coli in different models of cell-specific Ppara-deficiency and their controls.

The systemic and hepatic metabolic response was analyzed using biochemical, transcriptomic and functional assays.

PPARα expression was analyzed in livers from elective surgery and critically ill patients and correlated with hepatic gene expression and blood parameters.

PARAGRAPH

Both whole body and non-hematopoietic Ppara-deficiency in mice decreased survival upon bacterial infection.

Livers of septic Ppara-deficient mice displayed an impaired metabolic shift from glucose to lipid utilization resulting in more severe hypoglycemia, impaired induction of hyperketonemia and increased steatosis due to lower expression of genes involved in fatty acid catabolism and ketogenesis.

Hepatocyte-specific deletion of PPARα impaired the metabolic response to sepsis and was sufficient to decrease survival upon bacterial infection.

Hepatic PPARA expression was lower in critically ill patients and correlated positively with expression of lipid metabolism genes, but not with systemic inflammatory markers.

PARAGRAPH

During sepsis, Ppara-deficiency in hepatocytes is deleterious as it impairs the adaptive metabolic shift from glucose to FA utilization.

Metabolic control by PPARα in hepatocytes plays a key role in the host defense against infection.
