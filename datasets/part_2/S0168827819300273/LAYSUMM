TITLE

Hepatic PPARα is critical in the metabolic adaptation to sepsis

PARAGRAPH

As the main cause of death in critically ill patients, sepsis remains a major health issue lacking efficacious therapies.

While current clinical literature suggests an important role for inflammation, metabolic aspects of sepsis have mostly been overlooked.

Here, we show that mice with an impaired metabolic response, due to deficiency of the nuclear receptor PPARα in the liver, exhibit enhanced mortality upon bacterial infection despite a similar inflammatory response, suggesting that metabolic interventions may be a viable strategy for improving sepsis outcomes.
