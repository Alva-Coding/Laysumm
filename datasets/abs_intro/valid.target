Riga Cathedral (1211 AD) is one of the oldest sacred buildings of the medieval period in Latvia and also the Baltics. In recent years, deformations (cracks) have been observed in a number of Riga historic buildings, including Riga Cathedral. These buildings are supported by waterlogged wooden foundation piles. In this paper, the state of the art of archaeological foundation piles of Riga Cathedral was evaluated by microscopic, chemical and instrumental methods. Severe biological deterioration caused by microorganisms in the majority of pile samples was determined. The loss of foundation supporting strength is considered as the main reason for building deformations.
We describe two patients who experienced visual hallucinations, or visions of things not actually there, following brain surgery for uncontrollable seizures. The first patient had severe seizures at 20 months of age from brain injury due to traumatic head injury, and experienced frightening hallucinations for 3 months after having brain surgery at 3 years of age. The second patient had seizures from malformation of tissue in the brain and experienced scary visualizations 18 months after undergoing brain surgery at 6 years of age. In both of these patients, though hallucinations were florid, they subsided within 3-6 months.
Self-reported consumption of cannabis is relatively common in patients with epilepsy. The impact of chronic cannabis use on Wada (intracarotid amobarbital) testing (IAT), to localize speech and memory functions in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery, has not previously been described. We present a case series of patients who were chronic cannabis users and underwent IAT both before and after a period of enforced abstinence. These cases demonstrate a need for prospective studies that more formally assess the impact of cannabis use on IAT. Of particular interest may be the impact of cannabis products with varying ratios of canabidiol (CBD) to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
We use a variety of techniques to identify a raw material called Tertiary Hills Clinker that was used to make stone tools for over 10,000 years in northern Canada. We then match geochemical fingerprints of artifacts and source outcrop materials to demonstrate that Tertiary Hills Clinker was exchanged over an area of 1.25 million km². The way that people utilized Tertiary Hills Clinker changed after a large-scale volcanic eruption about 1200 years ago. We argue that the volcanic ash and its ecological impact fragmented pre-contact relationships, which may have stimulated one of the largest migrations of hunter-gatherers in North America.
Cova Bonica has yielded one of the few assemblages of Cardial Neolithic records of directly dated human remains (5470 and 5220 yr. cal. BC) in the Iberian Peninsula. A minimum of seven individuals have been ascribed on the basis of the disarticulated human bones. The paper concludes that the funerary and ritualistic practices of the Cardial Neolithic are difficult to reconstruct because human remains are often scattered in archaeological layers where other activities may also have been conducted. Only a multi-proxy analysis of the archaeological material is capable of evaluating different processes and their associated activities.
"Hemispherotomy is a surgical procedure for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, associated with unilateral hemispheric pathology. Compared to hemispherectomy, hemispherotomy is a less invasive procedure and therefore maybe associated with fewer complications. We report a series of patients who underwent hemispherotomy performed in our centers in Indonesia during a 20 year period and follow-up duration spanning from 24 to 160 months. Our surgical techniques include (a) vertical parasagittal approach, peri-insular hemispherotomy and disconnection, and a modified ""Shimizu approach"". To our knowledge this is the largest case series documenting hemispherotomy in an Indonesian population. Surgical outcome resulted in seizure freedom in 62.5% of people and 81.3% who showed improvement in pre-operative seizure frequency."
Malware analysis is fundamental to create and maintain reliable cyber-security systems capable of countering different threats. In the context of dynamic analysis, malware often remain hidden until a specific triggering action is performed by the user. SECUR-AMA is an Active Malware Analysis (AMA) framework for Android that mimics what a security expert does when analyzing a malware: it performs actions on the system, triggering malicious responses to generate a behavioral model of the application. SECUR-AMA learns from past interactions to guide the analysis aiming at maximizing the information that can be acquired on the malware while minimizing the number of triggering actions.
Cannabidiol (CBD) improves seizure frequency and severity in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy, but its effects on brain structure are poorly understood. Cannabis-induced neurotoxicity is thought to be mediated by Δ9-tetrahydrocannabidiol (THC). However, whether a pharmaceutical-grade CBD isolate with less than 0.3% THC contributes to such effects has not been investigated to date. We obtained imaging before and after 10-12 weeks of treatment with CBD and quantified structural brain changes with voxel- and surface-based morphometry. This preliminary study is the first to document that CBD does not significantly change grey matter volume or cortical thickness, despite improvements in seizure control.
In recent years, an increasing number of reports have indicated an association between amygdala enlargement (AE) and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, the etiology of AE remains unknown. Here, we report a case involving an adult female patient with TLE-AE characterized by late-onset seizures and cognitive impairment. Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibodies were detected in her cerebrospinal fluid. However, administration of appropriate anti-seizure drugs, without immunotherapy, improved her clinical symptoms. Moreover, reduction in the volume of AE was observed on MRI. We believe that our patient presented with a milder form or “forme fruste” of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.
To monitor the effect of muscle relaxant drugs in critically ill patients, we stimulate the muscle in rapid four sequence of electric impulse (Train of Four [TOF]), which makes the muscle twitch. Typical sites for TOF stimulation are the wrist, leg or facial nerve. We found electrical disturbance on electrode recording of brain activity through an advanced EEG software which captured the characteristic TOF neurostimulation pattern at the facial nerve location, but was mistakenly thought to be a seizure pattern. This case provides a unique ICU EEG artifact, helpful for nursing and ICU providers.
Obsidian is widely present at archaeological sites in the form of domestic refuse.The occurrence of surface water diffusion on these artifacts, and the formation of hydration layers over time, permits the chronometric dating of the specimens and the contexts in which they occur. Several environmental and chemical variables impact the rate of water diffusion, with the internal structural water of the glass being one of the most influential parameters. Our analysis of over 30 geological deposits shows that internal structural water may be highly variable within an ancient quarry but can be monitored by measurement of the glass specific gravity, or density. Using infrared spectroscopic analysis a calibration has been developed that relates obsidian density to structural water concentration in order that the appropriate hydration rate constants may be applied.
The paper deals with the application of the archaeological methods to the structural analysis and the modern methodologies of the point clouds survey, with the purpose of creating a series of products, all used to highlight the building and mechanical history of the edifices and to the knowledge of the seismic history of the territory. The historical center of Florence and, specifically, the church of San Remigio, has been chosen as a case study to illustrate the aforementioned methodology.
The late antique/early medieval age in Central Italy is a well-suited context to verify the implications of the end of the natron glass supplies, and to explore the beginnings of the new plant-ash glass technology. We present the results of a LA-ICP-MS analysis campaign conducted on archaeological glass finds excavated at the Santa Maria della Scala hospital site in Siena and in Donoratico. The collected samples fit well within known late Roman glass classifications (e.g. HIMT, Levantine). Trace element analysis provided further information on the raw materials that were used, which provided information on the glassmaking and the colouring processes.
Mechatronics design is a complex task involving many interdependencies between subsystems alongside a variety of objectives and constraints. Due to this complexity, a concurrent, systematic and multi-objective design methodology is crucial to replace the often-used sequential approach which deals with the different domains separately. This study presents a fuzzy-based approach for the modeling of a unified performance evaluation index in the detailed design of mechatronic systems by considering the interactions and correlations amongst the objectives. Using this method, we carried out the design of a vision-guided quadcopter which demonstrated performance improvements compared to a commercial system designed with traditional approach.
The quality of meat products (pig hams and loins) is traditionally assessed by chemical or sensorial analysis, which are time consuming, need specialized technicians and destroy the products. We use Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), computer vision (texture features) and machine learning (regression models) to predict 39 meat attributes. For most of them, the performance is good or excellent with a weighted absolute error below 2% and without statistically significant differences between predicted and true values. This automatic system could reliably predict the quality of meat pieces operating on-line in the meat industries in the future.
Repair and maintenance services are among the most lucrative aspects of the entire automobile business chain, but facing a serious customer churn problem in China for numerous 4S shops. A six-year dataset is studied. First, the absence and presence behaviors are defined and generated according to customer behavior patterns. Second, absence and presence behaviors are modeled as a whole from a lifecycle perspective, where a novel recurrent neural network is proposed and customized with behavior features and business insights. Model performs excellent in both prediction and efficiency. At last, targeted CRM strategies and managerial insights are proposed.
Without making any assumptions on data distribution, we propose a minimax probability extreme learning machine, which combines the benefits of minimax probability machines with extreme learning machines. It can be interpreted geometrically by minimizing the maximum of Mahalanobis distances to the two classes. Then two variants of the MPME are presented. The proposed methods can provide explicit upper-bounds for the generalization error. By comparison with traditional methods, experiments show that the proposed methods achieve comparable results in generalization, and are easy to implement for nonlinear classification.
A perennial challenge for archaeologists is locating the multiple components of archaeological sites, which can have uneven visibility and be spread across large distances. In this paper, we present the results of advances in drone-acquired imagery alongside historical aerial photography to detect previously unknown and widely dispersed archaeological features at Middle Grant Creek, a late prehistoric village (c. 1600 CE) at Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, Illinois. We detected probable housing and ritual areas and propose an expansion of the site from 3.4ha to 20ha. These findings contextualize ongoing archaeological excavations and expand how archaeologists can identify and investigate archaeological landscapes.
Pre–Hispanic ceramics from the Metzontla Valley, from the vicinity, and beyond, as well as raw materials were studied. NAA, EDS and XRD were applied. Six ceramic groups were identified: one of them includes pre–Hispanic Popoloca Orange ceramic and one other includes pre–Hispanic Brown and present–day Los Reyes Metzontla ceramic. Apparently raw materials have been the same for a long period of time and Popoloca Orange ceramic is no longer manufactured in the region. Similarities and differences were found among the ceramics of the Metzontla Valley and those of other sites of the Popoloca area and beyond.
Feature subset selection is an essential machine learning approach aimed at the process of dimensionality reduction of the input space. The fuzzy set and the rough set are two different but complementary theories that apply the fuzzy rough dependency as a criterion for performing feature selection. However, this concept can only maintain a maximal dependency function. It cannot fit a particular data set well. Therefore, in the current study, a novel intuitionistic fuzzy rough set model is proposed that fits the data well and prevents misclassification. Firstly, intuitionistic fuzzy decision of a sample is introduced using neighborhood concept. Then, intuitionistic fuzzy lower and upper approximations are constructed using intuitionistic fuzzy decision and parameterized intuitionistic fuzzy granule. Furthermore, a new dependency function is established. Moreover, a greedy forward algorithm is given using the proposed concept to calculate reduct set. From the experimental results, it can be observed that the proposed model provides more accurate reduct set than existing model.
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir taken once daily for 12 weeks resulted in high sustained virologic response rates in patients infected with HCV, irrespective of the presence of NS5A resistance-associated variants prior to treatment. Single class NS5A inhibitor resistance, but not sofosbuvir resistance, was detected in the few patients with virologic failure. These data highlight the high barrier to resistance of this regimen for the treatment of chronic HCV across all genotypes in the vast majority of patients.
Cirrhosis is a risk factor for primary liver cancer, leading to recommendations for periodic screening. However, for alcohol-related liver disease the rational of periodic screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial, as registry and databased studies have suggested a low incidence of HCC in these patients and highly competitive mortality rates. In this study, a large cohort of patients with biopsy-proven alcoholic cirrhosis prospectively screened for HCC demonstrated a high annual incidence of HCC (2.9%) and a high percentage of small cancers theoretically eligible for curative treatment. This suggests that patients with liver disease related to alcohol should not be ruled out of screening.
We aimed to determine whether direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) significantly improve overall survival in patients with hepatitis C virus-related compensated cirrhosis and a first diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) which has been successfully treated with curative resection or ablation. Using propensity-score matched patients, we found that DAAs improved overall survival and reduced the risk of hepatic decompensation. However, the risk of HCC recurrence was not significantly reduced.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease effects up to 30% of the population but only a minority of cases develop liver disease. Our study has shown that established blood tests can be used in primary care to stratify patients with fatty liver disease, leading to a reduction in unnecessary referrals by 80% and greatly improving the detection of cases of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.
This study was the first to evaluate an 8-week direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen active against all major types of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in untreated patients with compensated cirrhosis. High virological cure rates were achieved with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir across HCV genotypes 1–6, and these high cure rates did not depend on any patient or viral characteristics present before treatment. This may simplify care and allow non-specialist healthcare professionals to treat these patients, contributing to global efforts to eliminate HCV.
Recreational inhalation of ketamine is currently an important substance abuse issue worldwide, and can result in anomalies of the biliary system as demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging. Although prolonged exposure may lead to further clinical deterioration, such biliary system anomalies might be reversible after ketamine abstinence.
Rising hepatitis C-related morbidity and mortality is a major public health issue. However, development of highly effective medicines against hepatitis C (called direct-acting antivirals or DAAs) means hepatitis C could be eliminated as a public health threat by 2030. This study shows a sharp decline in liver disease morbidity and mortality since the introduction of DAAs in New South Wales, Australia. Despite this, heavy alcohol use remains an important risk factor for liver disease among people with hepatitis C. To ensure that the benefits of new antiviral treatments are not compromised, management of major comorbidities, including heavy alcohol use must improve among people with hepatitis C.
Herein, we report that therapeutic inhibition of a cell receptor expressed by bile duct cancer cells resulted in the loss of a critical survival protein termed MCL1. Cellular depletion of MCL1 resulted in the death of the cancer cells by a process characterised by cell rupture. Cell death by this process can stimulate the immune system and has implications for combination therapy using receptor inhibition with immunotherapy
Relapse of hepatitis B virus replication after discontinuation of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy in certain patients with chronic hepatitis B may alter the phenotype of T cells and enhance the responsiveness of hepatitis B virus-specific T cells to in vitro peptide stimulation. Blocking PD-L1 can further augment these hepatitis B virus-specific T cell responses. Interestingly, T cells of patients that subsequently achieve hepatitis B surface antigen loss are less exhausted at all time-points after stopping treatment and display a higher proliferative capacity 12-weeks after treatment discontinuation. These findings contribute to the understanding of the immunological events that occur during discontinuation of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy.
Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3) is a severe genetic liver disease that results from impaired transport of lipids to bile, which makes the bile toxic to liver cells. Because therapeutic options are currently limited, this study aims to evaluate gene therapy to correct the underlying genetic defect in a mouse model of this disease. By introducing a functional copy of the missing gene in liver cells of mice, we were able to restore lipid transport to bile and strongly reduce damage to the liver. The proliferation of liver cells was also reduced, which contributes to long-term correction of the phenotype. Further studies are required to evaluate whether this approach can be applied to patients with PFIC3.
Biliary atresia is a severe inflammatory and obstructive disease of bile ducts occurring in infancy. Although the cause is unknown, activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems injures the bile duct epithelium. In this study we found that patients’ livers had increased expression of inflammasome genes. Using mice engineered to inactivate individual inflammasome genes, the epithelial injury and bile duct obstruction were prevented by the loss of Il1r1 or Nlrp3, with a decreased activation of natural killer cells and expression of cytokines and chemokines. In contrast, the loss of Casp1 did not change the disease phenotype. Combined, the findings point to a differential role of inflammasome gene products in the pathogenic mechanisms of biliary atresia.
A mouse model combining chronic liver injury, acute hepatic insult, and bacterial infection recapitulates some of the key features of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) in patients. Both fibrosis and bacterial infection contribute to the impaired regenerative capacity of the liver in patients with ACLF. Herein, we show that IL-22Fc therapy improves ACLF by reprogramming impaired regenerative pathways and attenuating bacterial infection. Thus, it may have therapeutic potential for patients with ACLF.
Diabetes occurring in cirrhosis as a direct consequence of loss of liver function should regress after transplantation of a new functioning liver, though the pathophysiological mechanisms are unclear. This is the first study evaluating the contribution of all 3 direct determinants of insulin-dependent glucose regulation using a sophisticated mathematical model. Results show that β-cell function is the key process governing favourable or detrimental changes in glucose regulation in cirrhotic patients undergoing transplantation, pointing to the need to develop therapies to sustain β-cell function in these individuals.
Direct-acting antiviral medications are able to cure hepatitis C in the majority of patients. The most common genotype of hepatitis C in Europe and the United States is genotype 1a or 1b and most clinical trials focused on these genotypes. We report that in a group of African patients, most of them had unusual (non-1a/1b) genotype 1 subtypes, and that the cure rate in these unusual genotypes was lower than in genotypes 1a and 1b.
Cholestasis is common after burn injuries and is associated with burn severity, sepsis, organ failure and mortality. Patients with hyperbilirubinemia without elevated alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase levels after the burn injury have a poor prognosis. Patients with burn-associated cholestasis may develop sclerosing cholangitis and secondary biliary cirrhosis.
The relevance of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis E virus infections has been discussed controversially. Herein, we present the first report on routine hepatitis E virus screening of blood donations at a tertiary care centre in Germany. Hepatitis E viraemia was found at a relatively high rate of 0.12% among blood donors, which represents a relevant transfusion-related risk for vulnerable patient populations.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has become one of the most feared chronic liver diseases, because it is the most rapidly growing indication for adult liver transplantation and a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the mechanisms involved in the transformation of simple steatosis to steatohepatitis remain unclear. Herein, we show that gasdermin D driven pyroptosis is prominent in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and gasdermin-N domain remains a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of NASH. Gasdermin D plays a key role in the pathogenesis of NASH by regulating lipogenesis, the inflammatory response, and the NF-ĸB signaling pathway, revealing potential treatment targets for NASH in humans.
This study looks at patients who require a liver transplant to save their lives; this liver can be donated by a person who has died either after their heart has stopped (donation after cardiac death [DCD]) or after the brain has been injured and can no longer support life (donation after brainstem death [DBD]). We know that livers donated after brainstem death function better than those after cardiac death, but there are not enough of these livers for everyone, so we wished to help patients decide whether it was better for them to accept an early offer of a DCD liver than waiting longer to receive a “better” liver from a DBD donor. We found that patients were more likely to survive if they accepted the offer of a liver transplant as soon as possible (DCD or DBD), especially if their liver disease was very severe.
Some patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are non-obese. The optimal management of such patients is unclear. In this long-term follow-up study of a clinical trial, we show that remission of NAFLD can be achieved in 67% of non-obese patients after lifestyle intervention. The majority of patients can achieve NAFLD remission with modest weight loss of 3–10%. Non-obese patients are also more likely than obese patients to maintain weight reduction and normal liver enzymes in the long run.
Immunotherapy for metastatic cancer can be complicated by immune-related adverse events in the liver. In patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic cancer who develop immune-mediated hepatitis, liver biopsy is helpful for the diagnosis and evaluation of the severity of liver injury. This study demonstrates the need for patient-oriented management, which could eventually avoid unnecessary systemic corticosteroid treatment.
Despite hypothetical immunological concerns that the desensitization protocol for breaking through the ABO blood group barrier might have a negative impact on the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma, our experience demonstrated no significant differences in the long-term overall survival and recurrence-free survival rates between patients receiving ABO-compatible or ABO-incompatible liver transplantation. In conclusion, results from our institution indicated that ABO-incompatible living-donor liver transplantation constitutes a potentially feasible option for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, especially those with compensated cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma within conventional Milan criteria.
There are now medications (direct-acting antivirals or “DAAs”) that can “cure” hepatitis C virus, but patients with hepatitis C and liver cancer may be less likely to achieve cure than those without liver cancer. However, patients with liver cancer are also more likely to have advanced liver disease and risk factors that can decrease cure rates, so better controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings.
The lack of optimized public health screening strategies for the detection of liver fibrosis in adults without known liver disease presents a major healthcare challenge. Analyses from 6 independent international cohorts, with transient elastography measurements, show that a community-based risk-stratification strategy for alcohol-related and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases is cost-effective and potentially cost saving for our healthcare systems, as it leads to earlier identification of patients.
Chimeric animals are composed of cells from different species. Chimeric animals carrying human tissue have the potential to increase the availability of transplantable organs. We transplanted rat-to-mouse liver grafts into newly weaned rats. The chimeric grafts underwent post-transplant remodelling with rat hepatocytes replacing all mouse hepatocytes within 56 days. In addition, we observed the post-transplant development of diffuse mature rat bile ducts through the transformation of hepatocytes, and patchy areas of portal endothelium originating from the host. These data demonstrate the efficacy of transplanting rat-to-mouse chimeric livers into rats, with a high potential for post-transplant graft remodelling.
Hepatitis B virus causes a chronic infection which develops into severe liver disease and liver cancer. The viral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is responsible for the persistence of the infection in hepatocytes. To better manage patient treatment and follow-up, and to develop new antiviral treatments directly targeting the intrahepatic pool of cccDNA, serum surrogate markers reflecting the viral activity in the liver are urgently needed. In this work, we demonstrate that quantification of hepatitis B core-related antigen in serum correlates with cccDNA amount and activity and could be used to monitor disease progression.
In our study we assessed whether the Amsterdam-Oxford model (AOM) is able to correctly estimate the risk of liver transplantation or death in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). This model uses 7 objective and readily available variables to estimate prognosis for individual patients at the time of PSC diagnosis. The AOM may aid in patient counselling and timing of diagnostic procedures or therapeutic interventions for complications of liver disease. We confirm that the model works well at PSC diagnosis, but also when the AOM is recalculated at different timepoints during follow-up, greatly improving the applicability of the model in clinical practice and for individual patients.
Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), which develops in patients with cirrhosis, is characterized by intense systemic inflammation and organ failure(s). Because systemic inflammation is energetically expensive, its metabolic costs may result in organ dysfunction/failure. We identified a 38-metabolite blood fingerprint specific for ACLF that revealed mitochondrial dysfunction in peripheral organs. This may contribute to organ failures.
Treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX) for 12 weeks is the current recommendation for the 5% of patients infected with HCV who do not achieve eradication of the virus under treatment with direct-acting antivirals. In a Spanish cohort of 137 patients who failed a previous combination of direct-acting antivirals, a cure rate of 95% was achieved with SOF/VEL/VOX. Genotypic characteristics of the virus (genotype 3) and the presence of cirrhosis were factors that decreased the rate of cure. Treatment with SOF/VEL/VOX is an effective and safe rescue therapy due to its high efficacy and very good safety profile.
Patients who received direct-acting antiviral medications for hepatitis C at several liver centers in the US did not generally experience significant changes in baseline symptoms during treatment. We observed a full range of patient experiences with some patients experiencing substantial symptom improvements, yet others experiencing less improvements and some even experiencing a worsening of symptoms. The 1,346 patients who were cured of hepatitis C experienced improvements in fatigue, sleep disturbance, and functional well-being, and trends for improved pain and depression; whereas the 64 who were not cured experienced minimal improvements.
For patients with unresectable malignant biliary obstruction (MBO), placement of a self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) is a recommended palliative modality to relieve pruritus, cholangitis, pain, and jaundice. However, restenosis is a main pitfall after stent placement. Data from this first multicenter randomized controlled trial showed that insertion of an irradiation stent provided longer patency and better survival than a conventional metal stent.
Patients with cirrhosis of the liver are at risk of getting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC or liver cancer) and therefore it is recommended that they undergo surveillance for HCC. However, the risk of HCC varies dramatically in patients with cirrhosis, which has implications on if and how patients get surveillance, how providers counsel patients about the need for surveillance, and how healthcare systems approach and prioritize surveillance. We used readily available predictors to develop models estimating HCC risk in patients with cirrhosis, which are available as web-based tools at www.hccrisk.com.
We compared the hepatic arterial infusion of FOLFOX (a combination chemotherapy) with sorafenib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, retrospectively. It was found that hepatic arterial infusion of FOLFOX therapy may improve both progression free and overall survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
Alcoholic hepatitis is a life-threatening condition with no approved therapy that occurs unexpectedly in people who consume excess alcohol. The liver makes many metabolites, and we demonstrate that loss of one such metabolite β-hydroxybutyrate occurs in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. This loss can increase alcohol-induced liver injury, and β-hydroxybutyrate can protect from alcohol-induced liver injury via a receptor on liver macrophages. This opens the possibility of metabolite-based therapy for alcoholic hepatitis.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles may associate with apoB and acquire neutral lipids after exiting cells, giving them low-buoyant density. The hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) is a majorviral determinant of E2 that controls this process. Besides lipoproteins, specific serum factors including albumin promote extracellular maturation of HCV virions. HCV particle production in vitro, with media of defined serum conditions, enables production of infectious particles resembling those of chronically infected patients.
Liver fibrosis majorly contributes to mortality resulting from various liver diseases. We discovered a small RNA known as miRNA-221-3p, whose downregulation in hepatocytes results in reduced liver fibrosis. Thus, inhibition of miRNA-221-3p may serve as one of the therapeutic approaches for treatment of liver fibrosis.
Long noncoding RNAs play important roles in various biological processes. While long noncoding RNAs do not directly code proteins, they can regulate gene expression by diverse mechanisms. We identified the long noncoding RNA, termed lncHand2 because of its proximity to the gene Hand2, to be an important determinant of liver regeneration through c-Met signaling.
