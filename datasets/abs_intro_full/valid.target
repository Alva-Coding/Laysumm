In this paper, we introduce a super-fast supervised machine learning method, namely stochastic parallel extreme artificial hydrocarbon networks, or simply SPE-AHN. This model includes a simple batch learning process for consuming large amounts of data while training an artificial hydrocarbon network using nature-inspired optimization in parallel. In machine learning for large and big data, it requires novel solutions on model scalability, predictive power and fast training time. Thus, our method provides an alternative to this challenging problem. We anticipate our new method will be useful in many data-driven applications using large amounts of data, like in robotics, finance, health, aerospace, and many others.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an artificial intelligence technique which, like the human brain, works on feedback gathered from trials and errors. The actor-critic is a type of RL algorithm in which one of the algorithm’s parameters, called the actors, become very large in magnitude, causing the computer to crash. Therefore, this algorithm fails on large-scale industrial-strength cases. We develop a new actor-critic algorithm in which the computer crash is avoided, allowing the algorithm to deliver solutions on large-scale problems. We test the algorithm on large-scale airline pricing problems, where it performs better than a very popular industrial technique called EMSR-b.

Several reports have indicated an association between the presence of extreme delta brush (EDB) in the EEG with poor response to immunotherapy and unfavorable outcome in patients with anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis (ANMDARE). However, the adverse prognostic implication of EBD is less evident in some recent reports. Here, we report an adolescent girl with ANMDARE, who despite persistence of EDB for nearly 2 years in her serial EEGs, had a speedy and sustained response to immunotherapy. Our patient restates that, although presence of EDB supports the diagnosis of ANMDARE, its persistence may not reliably predict the response to immunotherapy and prognosis.

This article presents the second study of ochres associated with the Lower Magdalenian “Red Lady” human burial (18,700 years old) in El Mirón Cave (Cantabria, Spain). By means of instrumental techniques, the origin of the specially prepared idiomorphic hematite in the burial layer and painted on a large, engraved block adjacent to it was shown to be an outcrop 27 km from the site on the Atlantic coast (Santoña). Similar analyses show that the ochre used to stain the nearby cave wall adjacent to an engraved horse image is different in composition, as are other ochres in the Magdalenian occupations.

A boy with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome presented with seizure recurrence, loss of alertness, motor and language skills due to vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) electrode dysfunction. The electrode dysfunction was not detected during VNS device check-ups. After electrode replacement and reinitiating VNS, side effects occurred which forced us to switch it off. Switching off the VNS resulted in immediate seizure recurrence and subsequent status epilepticus. The status epilepticus could only be halted by reinitiating VNS therapy. Hereafter, he remained seizure free, is alert, and regained motor and language skills.
Analysis of archaeological settlements along the coast of Georgia, USA, shows evidence of a large-scale migration to the region around 1400 CE. The nature of settlement change and the timing of the creation of new settlements on the coast are related to the abandonment of the nearby Savannah River Valley. Immigrants from the Savannah River Valley may have chosen to settle among existing communities on the coast due to preexisting social connections and the offer of alternative life-ways following the abandonment of their previous social systems.

In 1928, archaeologist Dorothy Garrod and her team excavated Zarzi cave in Iraq. This cave was occupied by modern humans during the Epipalaeolithic, a period between the last Ice Age and the warm conditions of the Holocene. Among the finds from the cave were two small obsidian artifacts. Obsidian, however, does not naturally occur in Iraq. Instead, this volcanic glass must have been transported to the cave site by people. Chemical analysis of these two artifacts, both small blades, reveals that the obsidian originated from Nemrut Dağ volcano in what is now eastern Turkey, more than 650 km on foot.

Geological and archaeological analysis of stone masonries in standing structures helps reveal information about use of natural resources, organization of labour and supplies on the construction site. An interdisciplinary approach was applied for the study of building materials in distinct construction phases of the inner defensive wall in the fortified citadel of Carcassonne (Aude, France). Stratigraphic analysis of the architecture, short-range spectral remote sensing (hyperspectral imaging, portable Near Infrared - NIR) and portable ED-XRF measurements (Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence spectroscopy) were combined to classify sandstone elements and delineate raw materials varieties and their use or re-use through time.

Newly emerging location-based social network (LBSN) services provide us with new platforms to share interests and individual experience. The problems of data sparsity and user distrust in LBSNs create a severe challenge for traditional recommender systems. Moreover, users' behaviors in LBSNs show an obvious spatio-temporal pattern. Valuable extra information from microblog-based social networks (MBSNs) can be utilized to improve the effectiveness of POI suggestion. We propose a model to fulfill the top-$k$ suggestion based on the fused data of LBSNs and MBSNs. Extensive experiments on two real geo-social networks show the superiority of our model.

We present the case of a rare genetic form of epilepsy (MECP2 duplication syndrome) that is usually unresponsive to drug therapy. In our case, we show how valproic acid can help control seizures in some children with this rare genetic condition. The benefits of using valproic acid include its effectiveness as a single drug therapy, its ability to target multiple brain mechanisms, and the possibility of combining it with other drugs for an enhanced effect. There are side effects of valproic acid, but these can be addressed by reducing the drug dose and closely monitoring the patient’s bloodwork.

The main objective of this research was a multiple criteria, affective analysis of public spaces constituting cultural heritage (buildings, parks, squares, streets) and events (music, exhibitions, festivals) with the help of Affective Analytics of Demonstration Sites (ANDES). ANDES assists experts in more effective implementation of public spaces planning and participating in a process involving attendees/ visitors. This process involves collecting from visitors and examining various emotional parameters (emotions, valence, arousal) and physiological parameters (average crowd facial temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, crowd composition by sex and age group). Real-time mapping of the above-named parameters of people attending public spaces is conducted, producing personalized tips on ways to make public spaces (events) more efficient and public-centric.

This process involves collecting from visitors and examining various emotional parameters (emotions, valence, arousal) and physiological parameters (average crowd facial temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, crowd composition by sex and age group). Real-time mapping of the above-named parameters of people attending public spaces is conducted, producing personalized tips on ways to make public spaces (events) more efficient and public-centric.

This paper presents new carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of human and animal samples from two historical sites in central Italy to determine diet variation at the transition from classical (1st- 3rd century AD) to post-classical (6th – 8th century AD) time. Results obtained showed limited differences between the sites, although the distribution of data reveal a larger dispersion for the Roman set as opposed to the Longobard one. This is interpreted as a result of the mixed composition of the Roman population and might be indicative of a progressive impoverishment in the diet, mostly reliant on grains, during post-classical times.

The Par-Tee site (35CLT20), located on the northern Oregon Coast, is a large archaeological collection excavated in the 1960s and 1970s. Radiocarbon dates have been obtained on materials from the Par-Tee collection by researchers since the 1970s, but these data have not been assessed for chronometric hygiene. To establish a reliable chronology for the Par-Tee site, we obtained new high-resolution accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates and collagen peptide mass fingerprinting of cervid bones. We evaluate the new radiocarbon dates along with previous radiocarbon dates from the site, using chronometric hygiene assessments and Bayesian statistics to build a refined chronology.

This paper presents timbers study in the Faravel polymetallic district (Upper Durance valley, Southern French Alps). The dendrochronological study of well-preserved timbers from small-size opencast mines gave up accurate tree felling dates with seasonal resolution. The chronological distribution of these felling dates highlights nine distinct mining phases that occurred between 1059 and 1243 AD. Associated with archaeological observations and radiocarbon analyses, this chronology evidenced short, seasonal and low-intensity mining campaigns, mainly carried out after the bulk of agropastoral activities. Miners used rudimentary techniques based on the systematic reused of wood materials, which had limited impact on forest cover.

Herein, we established a system to generate human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived functional hepatobiliary organoids in vitro, without any exogenous cells or genetic manipulation. To some extent this model was able to recapitulate several key aspects of hepatobiliary organogenesis in a parallel fashion, holding great promise for drug development and liver transplantation.
A locus in the human leukocyte antigen gene (HLA-A*33:01, B*14:02, C*08:02) was significantly overrepresented in Caucasian and African American patients with liver injury attributed to the antifungal medication, terbinafine. These data along with the molecular docking studies demonstrate that this genetic polymorphism is a plausible risk factor for developing terbinafine hepatotoxicity and could be used in the future to help doctors make a diagnosis more rapidly and confidently.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by biliary inflammation and fibrosis, whose current medical treatment is hardly effective. We observed an increased interferon (IFN)-γ response in patients with PSC and in a mouse model of sclerosing cholangitis. IFNγ changed the phenotype of hepatic CD8+ T lymphocytes and NK cells towards increased cytotoxicity, and its absence decreased liver cell death, reduced frequencies of inflammatory macrophages in the liver and attenuated liver fibrosis. Therefore, IFNγ-dependent immune responses may disclose checkpoints for future therapeutic intervention strategies in sclerosing cholangitis.

Activation of the innate immune system contributes to inflammation in the progression of alcohol-related liver disease, as well as to the resolution of injury. Here we show that the protein IRF3 modulates the innate immune environment of the liver in a mouse model of alcoholic hepatitis. It does this by increasing the apoptotic cell death of immune cells that promote the resolution of injury.

Biliary atresia is a disease that affects newborns and is characterized by extrahepatic bile duct injury and obstruction, resulting in liver injury. We identify 4 key differences between the epithelial and submucosal layers of the neonatal and adult extrahepatic bile duct and show that these may render the neonatal duct particularly susceptible to injury.

There is a high burden of hepatitis C infection among prisoners worldwide. Prisoners who continue to inject drugs are also at risk of developing new infections. For this reason, the prison setting provides an opportunity to treat those people at greatest risk of infection and to stop transmission to others. We developed a new method of providing hepatitis C treatment to prisoners, in which nurses rather than doctors assessed prisoners locally at each prison site. Treatment was safe and most prisoners were cured. Such programs will contribute greatly to achieving the World Health Organization’s hepatitis C elimination goals.

The microenvironment is crucial for the self-renewal and development of hepatoma stem cells, which lead to the development of liver cancer. Lymphatic endothelial cells are an important component of this niche microenvironment, helping hepatoma stem cells to self-renew and escape immune attack, by upregulating IL-17A signaling. Thus, targeting IL-17A signaling is a potential strategy for the treatment of hepatoma.

In the clinical arm, graft YAP expression negatively correlated with liver function and tissue damage after human liver transplantation. YAP activation attenuated hepatocellular oxidative stress and diminished the innate immune response in mouse livers following ischemia-reperfusion injury. In the mouse model, YAP inhibited hepatic stellate cell activation, and abolished injury-mediated fibrogenesis up to 7 days after the ischemic insult.

Accumulation of abnormal proteins in the livers of patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency may lead to decreased liver function and potentially liver failure. Therapeutics targeting the production of these abnormal proteins may be used to prevent or treat liver disease in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
Tenofovir is the most potent nucleotide analogue for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection and there has been no hepatitis B virus mutation that confers >10-fold resistance to tenofovir up to 8 years. Herein, we identified, for the first time, a quadruple mutation that conferred 15.3-fold (IC50) and 26.3-fold (IC90) resistance to tenofovir in 2 patients who experienced viral breakthrough during tenofovir treatment.

Liver biopsy is a potentially painful and risky method to assess damage to the liver due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We analyzed data from a clinical trial to determine if 2 methods of magnetic resonance imaging – 1 to measure liver fat and 1 to measure liver fibrosis (scarring) – could potentially replace liver biopsy in evaluating NASH-related liver injury. Both imaging methods were correlated with biopsy in showing the effects of NASH on the liver.

Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on the pathogenesis and progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of a genetic variant in the KLB gene on the severity of liver disease. Our data suggest that the KLB protein plays a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.

There are still controversies concerning the impact of non-selective beta blockers on outcomes in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, especially in those with refractory ascites. In this study of 584 cirrhotic patients evaluated for liver transplantation, who underwent right heart catheterization, we have shown that global cardiac performance measured by left ventricular stroke work index is lower in patients with refractory ascites. Administration of non-selective beta blockers in patients with compromised cardiac performance may increase waiting list mortality. These results highlight the prognostic value of global cardiac performance in patients with end-stage cirrhosis.

Biliary tract cancers include intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC), however there are some differences in their risk factors. Consequently, the distinction between ICC and ECC is important. Over the last few decades, mortality from ICC has tended to rise in several areas of the world, following the increased prevalence of its major risk factors. In contrast, mortality from ECC tended to decrease in most countries, following the increased use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Alcoholic liver disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent studies highlight the involvement of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism. Our study reveals that deficiency of sorting nexin (SNX) 10 increases the stability of LAMP-2A by inhibiting cathepsin A maturation, resulting in the increase of CMA activity and, thus, alleviates alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis.

There are currently no pharmacological treatment options for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is now the most frequent liver disease. Necroptosis is a regulated process of cell death that can occur in hepatocytes during NAFLD. Herein, we show that RIPK1, a gatekeeper of the necroptosis pathway that is activated in NAFLD, can be inhibited by RIPA-56 to reduce not only liver injury, inflammation and fibrosis, but also steatosis in experimental models. These results highlight the potential of RIPK1 as a therapeutic target in NAFLD.

Acute liver injury due to heatstroke can progress to acute liver failure with organ dysfunction despite medical treatment; in such situations, liver transplantation (LT) may offer a therapeutic option. The classic criteria for LT appear to be poorly adapted to heatstroke-related acute liver failure. We confirmed that medication is the first-line therapy acute liver injury caused by heatstroke, with LT only rarely necessary. A decision to perform LT should not be made hastily. Fluctuations in prothrombin time and the patient’s clinical status should be considered even in the event of severe liver failure.

Alcoholic hepatitis is a life-threatening condition with no approved therapy that occurs unexpectedly in people who consume excess alcohol. The liver makes many metabolites, and we demonstrate that loss of one such metabolite β-hydroxybutyrate occurs in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. This loss can increase alcohol-induced liver injury, and β-hydroxybutyrate can protect from alcohol-induced liver injury via a receptor on liver macrophages. This opens the possibility of metabolite-based therapy for alcoholic hepatitis.

Postoperative hepatitis B virus reactivation was associated with an increased complication rate and a decreased survival rate after liver resection in patients with ICC and hepatitis B virus infection. Antiviral therapy before liver resection reduced the risk of postoperative viral reactivation. Both pre- and postoperative antiviral therapy was effective in prolonging patient survival.

Acute liver failure is a rapidly progressive deterioration of liver function resulting in high mortality. In experimental mouse models of acute liver failure, we found that two metabolic enzymes, namely pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and lactic dehydrogenase, translocate to the nucleus resulting in detrimental gene expression. Treatment with an inhibitor of these two enzymes was found to reduce liver damage and to improve survival.

There is a growing epidemic of advanced liver disease, this could be offset by early detection and management. Checking liver blood tests (LFTs) should be an opportunity to diagnose liver problems, but abnormal results are often incompletely investigated. In this study we were able to substantially increase the diagnostic yield of the abnormal LFTs using the automated intelligent LFT system. With the addition of referral recommendations and management plans, this strategy provides optimum investigation and management of LFTs and is cost saving to the NHS.

During chronic injury, the liver often repairs with fibrotic tissue, which impairs liver function, and for which there is currently no treatment. We found that a previously unexplored pathway involving the purinergic receptor P2X4, can modulate fibrotic liver repair. Therefore, this receptor could be of interest in the development of novel therapies for fibrotic liver diseases.
Limited access to the diagnostic tools used to assess treatment eligibility (liver biopsy/Fibroscan/hepatitis B virus DNA) has been an obstacle to the scale up of hepatitis B treatment programs in low- and middle-income countries. Using the data from African patients with chronic HBV infection, we developed and validated a new simple diagnostic score for treatment eligibility, which only consists of hepatitis B virus e antigen and alanine aminotransferase level. The diagnostic accuracy of the score for selecting patients for HBV treatment was high and could be useful in African settings.

Using the data from African patients with chronic HBV infection, we developed and validated a new simple diagnostic score for treatment eligibility, which only consists of hepatitis B virus e antigen and alanine aminotransferase level. The diagnostic accuracy of the score for selecting patients for HBV treatment was high and could be useful in African settings.
The lack of optimized public health screening strategies for the detection of liver fibrosis in adults without known liver disease presents a major healthcare challenge. Analyses from 6 independent international cohorts, with transient elastography measurements, show that a community-based risk-stratification strategy for alcohol-related and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases is cost-effective and potentially cost saving for our healthcare systems, as it leads to earlier identification of patients.

Liver adenomatosis is a rare disease characterized by the presence of 10 or more hepatocellular adenomas that may rarely be of genetic origin. Patients with liver adenomatosis have multiple adenomas of different subtypes, with a risk of bleeding and malignant transformation that justify a specific management and follow-up.

Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency (LAL-D) is a rare genetic condition that can cause severe liver disease, but it is difficult to diagnose and sometimes can look like simple fatty liver. It was not clear how common LAL-D was and whether many cases were being missed. To study this, we searched for all genetic mutations that could cause LAL-D, calculated how common those mutations were, and added them up. This let us estimate that LAL-D affects roughly 1 in 175,000 people. We conclude that LAL-D is a very rare condition, but it is treatable so may be included in a ‘second-line’ of tests for causes of fatty liver.

Multiple organ failures, ranging from 1–6, are common in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis. The survival without liver transplant is dismal in the presence of three or more organ failures. Small retrospective studies have shown that liver transplant is feasible with good outcomes even in the presence of multiple organ failures. In this study, using a large national dataset, we show that survival chances for more than 30 days in those with three or more organ failures are less than 8%. However, if a liver transplant is performed quickly, the survival chances are very high with one-year survival ranging from 84% with three organ failures to 81% with 5–6 organ failures.
While the efficacy of sofosbuvir for the treatment of hepatitis C virus is clear, data regarding its possible nephrotoxicity are controversial. Herein, we showed that sofosbuvir worsened on-treatment kidney function but led to an off-treatment improvement. Our findings suggest that treating physicians should be alert to risk factors for kidney dysfunction before initiating direct-acting antiviral treatment for patients with hepatitis C virus infection.

Herein, we reveal a new mechanism for cholesterol gallstone formation, in which increased paracellular phosphate ion permeability across hepatobiliary epithelia causes calcium phosphate core formation and cholesterol gallstones. Thus, altered phosphate ion metabolism under cholesterol overdose plays a major role in the lifestyle- and age-related risks of developing cholesterol gallstone disease.

We detected no significant difference in early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence rates and patterns between patients who received interferon-based and direct-acting antiviral therapy after HCC treatment. High lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of alpha-fetoprotein level, short recurrence-free period, and a history of multiple HCC treatments were independent risk factors for early HCC recurrence after the initiation of antiviral therapy.

Relapse of hepatitis B virus replication after discontinuation of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy in certain patients with chronic hepatitis B may alter the phenotype of T cells and enhance the responsiveness of hepatitis B virus-specific T cells to in vitro peptide stimulation. Blocking PD-L1 can further augment these hepatitis B virus-specific T cell responses. Interestingly, T cells of patients that subsequently achieve hepatitis B surface antigen loss are less exhausted at all time-points after stopping treatment and display a higher proliferative capacity 12-weeks after treatment discontinuation. These findings contribute to the understanding of the immunological events that occur during discontinuation of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy.

The early stages of human liver development were modeled using human hepatic organoids. We identified a pathway that was essential for early liver development. Based upon this finding, a novel combination drug therapy was identified that could be used to treat primary liver cancer and possibly other types of cancer.
Radiofrequency ablation and liver transplantation are treatment options for early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). After ablation some patients will experience recurrence or metastatic spread of the initial tumor or may develop new tumors within the liver. Despite close follow-up, these recurrences can progress rapidly and exceed transplant criteria, preventing the patient from receiving a transplant. We identified that patients with HCC >2 cm and higher serum alpha-fetoprotein are at greater risk of recurrence beyond the transplant criteria. These data suggest that liver transplantation should be considered immediately after the first HCC recurrence for these patients.
Patients with cirrhosis who are on the liver transplant waiting list often develop complications which prevent them from receiving a transplant. Circulatory dysfunction is a key factor behind a number of complications. This study was aimed at investigating whether treating patients with midodrine (a vasoconstrictor) and albumin would improve circulatory dysfunction and prevent complications. This combined treatment, at least at the doses administered in this study, did not prevent the complications of cirrhosis or improve the survival of these patients.

Acetaminophen (APAP) induced acute liver failure because of over dose is a leading public health problem. APAP-induced liver injury exhibits diurnal variation, specifically APAP causes more severe liver damage when taken at night compared with in the morning. Herein, we showed that gut microbial metabolite, 1-phenyl-1,2-propanedione is involved in the rhythmic hepatotoxicity induced by APAP, by depleting hepatic glutathione (an important antioxidant) levels. Our data suggest gut microbiota may be a potential target for reducing APAP-induced acute liver injury.
