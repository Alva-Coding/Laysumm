Artificial hydrocarbon networks (AHN) – a supervised learning method inspired on organic chemical structures and mechanisms – have shown improvements in predictive power and interpretability in comparison with other well-known machine learning models. However, AHN are very time-consuming that are not able to deal with large data until now. In this paper, we introduce the stochastic parallel extreme artificial hydrocarbon networks (SPE-AHN), an algorithm for fast and robust training of supervised AHN models in high-dimensional data. This training method comprises a population-based meta-heuristic optimization with defined individual encoding and objective function related to the AHN-model, an implementation in parallel-computing, and a stochastic learning approach for consuming large data. We conducted three experiments with synthetic and real data sets to validate the training execution time and performance of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed SPE-AHN outperforms the original-AHN method, increasing the speed of training more than 10,000x times in the worst case scenario. Additionally, we present two case studies in real data sets for solar-panel deployment prediction (regression problem), and human falls and daily activities classification in healthcare monitoring systems (classification problem). These case studies showed that SPE-AHN improves the state-of-the-art machine learning models in both engineering problems. We anticipate our new training algorithm to be useful in many applications of AHN like robotics, finance, medical engineering, aerospace, and others, in which large amounts of data (e.g. big data) is essential. Machine learning is continuously releasing its power in a wide range of applications.Large and big data paradigms allow these algorithms to make more accurate and timely predictions; but it carries a cost that involves challenges in model scalability and distributed computing.Moreover, machine learning and data mining tasks in big data includes different nature of inputs that typically exhibit high dimensionality, e.g. more than 1000 features, far from current acceptable scales computing in a single machine (Bekkerman, 2012).

Machine learning can be characterized by the nature of learning feedback, target of learning tasks, and timing of data availability.In many different domains, data have highly nonlinear representations that nature-inspired models can easily capture, outperforming simple models.However, these machine learning models require to learn thousands, even millions, of model parameters that classical techniques like gradient descent algorithms (GDA) do not find feasible solutions (Bengio, 2012).

Falling into local optimum solutions is one of the most frequent limitations of GDA when training machine learning algorithms (Bengio, 2012).In addition, oscillations near to valley-shapes of the search space slows down the convergence of the algorithms (Qian, 1999).In this regard, literature reports different modifications to GDA.For example, one of first attempts is the inclusion of a momentum term to reduce the oscillation and improve the convergence (Qian, 1999), as developed in the Nesterov accelerated gradient (Yurii, 1983) that predicts future steps in the gradient that accelerates the procedure.Adaptive subgradient methods for online learning and stochastic optimization (Adagrad) (Duchi and Singer, 2011) outperforms the optimization process in sparse spaces, but the auto-updating in its parameters becomes inefficient after several iterations.For instance, in Lin et al. (2019), Adagrad method is used to improve recognition of facial expressions.An improvement of Adagrad is Adadelta/RMSprop (Zeiler, 2012) which restricts the parameters in the first steps to keep it effective.An alternative method is Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) that adapts its parameters and performs bias-correction that improves its performance in comparison to Adadelta/RMSprop.Its main advantages are related to low computational complexity requirements, reduced number of parameters, and its suitability for efficient resolution of complex problems.This approach is currently applied for improving climate-affected image resolutions (Zhang et al., 2019), on deep learning concepts to address electrocardiogram-based pulse detection problems (Elola et al., 2019), or identification of cardiac arrhythmia through the use of intelligent models (Hannun et al., 2019).Furthermore, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods (Konecny et al., 2016; Robbins and Monro, 1951) addresses the issue of high computational cost by having much faster convergence (Sharma, 2018).In machine learning, SGD solve problems related to convolutional neural networks efficiently.Noteworthy, there are models in the literature that report the usage of SGD like in Zhang et al. (2015a) that deals with scene identification and classification, in Pinckaers et al. (2019) in which the authors proposed a model dealing with problem-solving in prostate cancer identification, or in Mall et al. (2019) where the authors investigated the identification of breast cancer in mammography exams.Finally, in the identification area of real-world image denoising (Chen et al., 2019), the stochastic approach to optimization seeks to solve problems with complex images.

For instance, there are the population-based optimization methods, in which possible solutions are represented by individuals.They are typically inspired on social behavior of animals and other entities.These meta-heuristic optimization algorithms generates a set of candidates that traverse the search space to find optimal solutions.At each step, these individuals share information to follow the best solution found so far.Mechanisms like cooperation, organization and decentralization of the individuals allow emerging intelligence in the population, so near-optimal solutions can be reached out (Dorigo and Birattari, 2010; Mirjalili et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2018).As an example of nature-inspired population-based optimization algorithm is particle swarm optimization (PSO).It is a heuristic global optimization method based on swarm intelligence.It aims to simulate the biological behavior of fish schooling and bird flocking (Xu and Yu, 2018).

To overcome the above limitations regarding to the gradient-based training algorithm implemented in AHN (i.e. falling into local optimum solutions), we consider using meta-heuristic optimization methods.Specifically, optimization algorithms have been incorporated to machine learning models for their ability to approximate high dimensional functions.They also achieve measurable accuracy and precision with gradient-free optimization approaches, making it easier to compute on real-world problems.From these algorithms, meta-heuristic approaches have yielded especially accurate results for classification and regression tasks (Mirjalili, 2015).However, meta-heuristic algorithms tend to increase computational cost if they are based on population exploration.To minimize the impact of meta-heuristic approximations on the training phase, distributed computing frameworks and parallel strategies have been implemented.While distribution strategies look to divide the tasks in numerous executors that compute the algorithm on a portion of the data set, parallelism strategies look to use all available cores to enable multi-threaded execution (Bekkerman, 2012).

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an artificial intelligence technique used to solve Markov and semi-Markov decision processes. Actor critics form a major class of RL algorithms that suffer from a critical deficiency, which is that the values of the so-called actor in these algorithms can become very large causing computer overflow. In practice, hence, one has to artificially constrain these values, via a projection, and at times further use temperature-reduction tuning parameters in the popular Boltzmann action-selection schemes to make the algorithm deliver acceptable results. This artificial bounding and temperature reduction, however, do not allow for full exploration of the state space, which often leads to sub-optimal solutions on large-scale problems. We propose a new actor–critic algorithm in which (i) the actor’s values remain bounded without any projection and (ii) no temperature-reduction tuning parameter is needed. The algorithm also represents a significant improvement over a recent version in the literature, where although the values remain bounded they usually become very large in magnitude, necessitating the use of a temperature-reduction parameter. Our new algorithm is tested on an important problem in an area of management science known as airline revenue management, where the state-space is very large. The algorithm delivers encouraging computational behavior, outperforming a well-known industrial heuristic called EMSR-b on industrial data. Reinforcement Learning or RL (see Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis (1996), Sutton and Barto (1998), Gosavi (2014b) and Szepesvári (2010)) is used to solve problems in which an agent selects optimal actions in an unknown stochastic environment via repeated trials and errors.In every trial, the agent gathers feedback from the environment and uses the feedback to update its knowledge base.Typically, after a large number of trials and errors in its interactions, the agent learns to select an optimal action in every state.The Markov Decision Process or Problem (MDP) and the semi-MDP (SMDP) (Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1996) have been extensively used as the underlying models in the above-described RL domain.Essentially, in the MDP model, the underlying system dynamics and behavior are governed by Markov chains.Further, in an MDP, the time taken in a one-step transition from any state to any other is assumed to be the same.The SMDP is a more general model in which this transition time is assumed to be a random variable whose distribution is known.

Our new algorithm is tested on an important problem in an area of management science known as airline revenue management, where the state-space is very large. The algorithm delivers encouraging computational behavior, outperforming a well-known industrial heuristic called EMSR-b on industrial data. In this paper, we study a class of RL algorithms known as actor critics.The classical actor–critic algorithm (Barto et al., 1983) predates the more popular RL algorithm, namely, Q-Learning, discovered by Watkins (1989).The classical actor–critic algorithm, however, has the following critical deficiency: the values of one class of iterates of the algorithm, called the actor’s values, become unbounded, i.e., become very large in magnitude.This causes the computer to overflow.One approach to alleviate this difficulty is to use a mathematical projection that artificially bounds the actor values (Borkar, 2008).However, this artificial bounding curtails the amount of exploration the algorithm can perform, leading to poor solutions on large-scale problems at times.Kulkarni et al. (2011) studied a version of this projection-bounded actor–critic algorithm on a problem from airline revenue management, but the best results from these algorithms were obtained from employing numerous replications (re-runs of the simulations with new sets of random numbers).In other words, at times, the algorithm did not explore sufficiently (Gosavi et al., 2012).To alleviate this difficulty, Gosavi (2014a) proposed a variant of the classical algorithm in which the actor’s values were naturally bounded; however, experimentation with this algorithm also showed that the magnitude of the actor’s values still often become quite large.When the magnitude of the values becomes large, one needs to use a temperature-tuning parameter in the Boltzmann action-selection strategy, which unfortunately adds a whole layer to the computational exercise involved in the algorithm (Lawhead et al., 2017).Also, different temperatures lead to different depths of exploration, and hence one must then search for a good temperature for the best exploration.Further, even with this temperature tuning, the algorithm in Gosavi (2014a) may still explore insufficiently on large-scale problems, leading the user to sub-optimal solutions.In other words, overall, the artificial projection as well as the temperature-tuning make it harder to use the algorithm in practice.

Contributions of this paper: In this paper, we present a new algorithm that provides a significant improvement in its performance over that of the above-described past work in the existing literature in the following ways: (i) the actor’s values remain naturally bounded, thereby eliminating the need for any artificial projection, and (ii) the actor’s values also remain small in magnitude, thereby eliminating the need for any temperature tuning with the Boltzmann action-selection.The algorithm is first tested on small-scale problems in this paper to demonstrate both of these features.But, the true test of strength for any RL algorithm is on large-scale problems, where unless the algorithm explores sufficiently, it cannot generate satisfactory performance.We hence tested our algorithm on a large-scale problem from airline revenue management with real-world data, where it outperformed a well-known industrial heuristic called EMSR-b (Talluri and van Ryzin, 2004b).We further note that while the λ-SMART algorithm (Gosavi et al., 2002) and the projection-bounded actor–critic algorithm in Kulkarni et al. (2011) are other examples of RL algorithms that have been applied to the airline revenue management problem in the past, the λ-SMART algorithm is based on a finite trajectory, which may not be applicable to all RL settings, and the projection-bounded actor–critic algorithms of the past do not always return optimal solutions in practice.

(2012).Actor–critics have also been studied via a control-theoretic viewpoint (Lewis and Vrabie, 2009; Venayagamoorthy et al., 2002; Werbös, 1987; Liu et al., 2001).Finally, RL algorithms based on Q-Learning (Watkins, 1989) and SARSA (Rummery and Niranjan, 1994) have been used widely in industrial problems, ranging from preventive maintenance (Das et al., 1999; Aissani et al., 2009) to supply chain management (Pontrandolfo et al., 2002; Mortazavi et al., 2015; Chaharsooghi et al., 2008) and robotics (Kober et al., 2013), but industrial-scale applications of actor–critics are not as common as those of traditional Q-Learning-based algorithms.
We describe an adolescent girl with non-paraneoplastic anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis (ANMDARE), who despite persistence of the extreme delta brush (EDB) pattern for nearly 2 years in her serial EEGs, she exhibited a speedy and sustained response to immunotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, our patient had the longest persistence of the EDB pattern on EEG reported to date. Our patient illustrates that, although presence of EDB supports the diagnosis of ANMDARE, its presence and persistence may not be a reliable predictor of response to immunotherapy and overall clinical prognosis. The red circle depicts the functional deficit zone over the left parietal lobe at or close to angular gyrus. Serial EEGs show left hemispheric polymorphic slow activity, maximally over the centro-parietal region, along with EDB. The montages for all EEGs are as magnified in the box.Unlabelled Image Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis (ANMDARE) is a disorder presenting with subacute onset of seizures, psychosis, memory and language deficits, abnormal movements, and breathing and autonomic disturbances [1,2].Although initially identified in association with ovarian teratomas, in a majority of children and young adults, ANMDARE occurs without tumors [2].Three-fourths of patients with ANMDARE make substantial recovery with early diagnosis, tumor resection and immunotherapy, but relapses may occur in a quarter of them [1].

This article presents the second study of ochres associated with the Lower Magdalenian (18.7 cal kya) “Red Lady” human burial in El Mirón Cave (Cantabria, Spain). In the first study (Seva Román et al., 2015), we determined that the burial deposit contained iron oxides and idiomorphic hematite that were not from sources near the site, but possibly from Monte Buciero, some 27 km to the north on the present Atlantic shore in Santoña. We have now analyzed sediments both from the burial and from samples taken during prospection on Monte Buciero, along with ochres from deposits above the burial layer, from the face of a large limestone block immediately adjacent to the burial, and from an area of the cave wall close to it in the NE corner of the cave vestibule that bears the engraving of a horse. As before, the analyses used were binocular microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDX) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). We were thus able to determine that the sources of the ochres in the burial deposit and on the block are the same—Monte Buciero. However we found substantial differences between the ochre on the block and the ochre underlying the horse panel image on the cave wall, which very likely also dates to sometime in the Magdalenian. The instrumental analysis of ochres has provided important information on the various uses of these mineral oxides in prehistory (e.g., García Borja et al., 2004; Bersani and Lottici, 2016; Eiselt et al., 2011; Marshall et al., 2005; Mooney et al., 2003; Popelka et al., 2007, 2008, 2016; Rifkin et al., 2016; Ferrier et al., 2017), including Upper Paleolithic cave painting (Clottes et al., 1990a, 1990b; Hernanz et al., 2010, 2012; Hernanz, 2015; Iriarte et al., 2009, 2017; Seva Román et al., 2015), and possible use by Neanderthals (Zilhão, 2001; Zilhão et al., 2010; D'Errico et al., 1998, 2010; Hovers et al., 2003; Roebroeks et al., 2012).The arguably symbolic use of red ochre has been documented from archeological sites in Africa, the Near East and Europe dating as early as the Acheulean and Middle Paleolithic/Middle Stone Age, and may be a fundamentally common characteristic of genus Homo (e.g., Wreschner, 1980; Watts, 2002; Hovers et al., 2003).

Here we continue the analysis of the Magdalenian use of ochres from the major Paleolithic and post-Paleolithic site of El Mirón Cave on the northern edge of the Cantabrian Cordillera in Ramales (eastern Cantabria Province, Spain) that was excavated between 1996 and 2013 by Straus and González Morales (e.g., González-Morales and Straus, 2000, 2009; Straus and González Morales, 2003; Straus and González-Morales, 2012a, 2012b; Straus et al., 2002, 2011).In particular, the study of the “Red Lady” Lower Magdalenian human burial directly dated to 18.7 cal.kya and monographically published by González Morales and Straus (2015), found that the sediments covering the skeleton were rich in ochres and idiomorphic hematite of non-local origin (Seva Román et al., 2015).

The purpose of this article is empirically to determine whether the red ochres intimately associated with the burial and found on adjacent and nearby rock surfaces were of local or non-local origin.A finding for the latter possibility would confirm the very special, presumably ritualized nature of the use of red pigment with hematite crystals in the context of the burial.Such a determination would positively add to the interpretation of complex burial practices entailing considerable effort by societal members for at least certain deceased individuals, as is already known from numerous burials of Magdalenian age (including several adult females), as well as from Epigravettian and earlier Upper Paleolithic interments throughout Europe (including Portugal) (see Pettitt, 2011; Henry-Gambier, 2018; Uthmeier, 2018), but now for the first time from Spain.

However we found substantial differences between the ochre on the block and the ochre underlying the horse panel image on the cave wall, which very likely also dates to sometime in the Magdalenian. From local geological maps (IGME, 1974a, 1974b, 1978, 1982; Vera, 2004), we had previously deduced that the kind of hematite found at the burial could be located from Monte Buciero.This hill has a height of 378 m and dominates the present mouth of the Asón River in the town of Santoña.About 22 km in a straight line from El Mirón, this hill contains Magdalenian and Azilian cave and rockshelter sites.We conducted a field prospection and collected samples for analysis and comparison with ochres from the burial deposit (Level 504) and from the eastern surface of a large (2.1 × 1.4 × 0.9 m) limestone block immediately adjacent to the burial.One goal was to obtain information on the possible relationship of the ochre on the block to the burial.It had been demonstrated stratigraphically and by AMS radiocarbon dating that the block had fallen during the Lower Magdalenian period “soon” (i.e. <19.7 cal.kya) before the burial, creating a c. 1 m-wide space between it and the SE cave wall at the vestibule rear.Furthermore– and most suggestive– the western face of the block (which is the flat, inner surface that had detached from the cave ceiling), bears numerous linear engravings (including the possible representation of a vulva) that were progressively covered over by later Magdalenian-age occupation deposits.The terminus post and ante quem dates for the engravings indicate that they had been made roughly contemporaneously with the burial behind the block and that this decorated block could have been a kind of grave marker (González Morales and Straus, 2014, 2015).The ochre staining in the area of the eastern face of the block that was intimately contiguous with the burial may also have been related to ritual associated with the interment, hence the interest in comparing the compositions of the ochre in the burial deposit with the staining on the block and in conclusively identifying the non-local origin of these pigments.
We report a child with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome with an increase in seizure frequency and loss of psychomotor skills due to a disintegrated cervical VNS lead, not detected during standard device monitoring. The lead was completely removed and replaced by a new 303 lead on the same nerve segment. After reinitiating VNS, side effects forced us to switch it off, resulting in immediate seizure recurrence. EEG recording demonstrated a non-convulsive status epilepticus that was halted by reinitiating VNS therapy. Thereafter, he remained seizure free for eight months, and regained psychomotor development. Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is one of the most challenging epilepsies to manage, due to a range of different seizure types which are frequently refractory to anti-seizure drug treatment.In patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, treatment options other than anti-seizure drugs are often considered; including epilepsy surgery, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy and a ketogenic diet.
Following the 14th century depopulation of the Savannah River Valley of modern Georgia and South Carolina, the neighboring coastal region of Georgia exhibited significant changes in settlement. In the absence of other demographic proxies, Georgia state site file data show that there was a greater accumulation of archaeological components during the 14th century than in any other preceding period. Exploratory Bayesian modeling of settlement practices using a compiled set of legacy radiocarbon dates demonstrates that much of this expansion of settlement happened concomitant with the depopulation of the Savannah River Valley. Climatic instability is one of the greatest natural challenges facing human groups.Drought, in particular, has been a major stressor of subsistence and sociopolitical systems.Droughts vary in geographic and temporal scale, sometimes intermittent and local, and occasionally decadal and regional.Human responses to drought vary in kind.For example, in the American Southwest, a significant disruption in normal rainfall patterns between 1250 CE and 1450 led to the abandonment of the Kayenta and Greater Mesa Verde regions (Cameron, 1995; Dean and Funkhouser, 1995; Hill et al., 2004; Lekson and Cameron, 1995; Mills et al., 2015).Decades of study have shown that these two cases of abandonment and migration led to very different social outcomes for both migrants and locals based on the cultural and environmental contexts of their respective homelands and destinations (Clark and Lyons, 2012; Mills, 2011; Ortman, 2012; Ortman et al., 2014; Stone, 2015).

Exploratory Bayesian modeling of settlement practices using a compiled set of legacy radiocarbon dates demonstrates that much of this expansion of settlement happened concomitant with the depopulation of the Savannah River Valley. These cases from the American Southwest are notable due to the high resolution in chronology, climate, and settlement that has been accessible to researchers.However, other cases of abandonment and movement have also been reported in North America.For example, researchers in the Eastern Woodlands of the United States have documented several cases of abandonment and population movement (Cobb and Butler, 2002; Krus and Cobb, 2018; Meeks and Anderson, 2013; Snow, 1995, 1996; Willey, 1953).One well-documented example is the abandonment of the Middle and Lower Savannah River Valley (SRV) at some point during the latter half of the 14th century.The 14th century was a period of environmental stress in the Savannah River Valley, with dendrochronological analysis revealing below-average rainfall resulting in estimated harvest shortfalls during 12 of the 19 years from 1359 CE to 1377 (Anderson et al., 1995).Perhaps as a result, the complex societies of the SRV abandoned their settlements and mound centers by 1400 CE (Anderson, 1994; Stephenson et al., 2015).This abandonment marked the collapse of several Mississippian chiefdoms that had occupied the valley for the previous 150 years.

Exploratory Bayesian modeling of settlement practices using a compiled set of legacy radiocarbon dates demonstrates that much of this expansion of settlement happened concomitant with the depopulation of the Savannah River Valley. At the mouth of the Savannah River on the Georgia Coast, the beginning of the Irene phase (1300–1580 CE) coincided with abandonment of the SRV.At that time, the northern Georgia Coast saw an expansion of settlement (Pearson, 1978; Sipe, 2013; Thomas, 2008c), incorporation of Mississippian stylistic motifs and ritual goods (Moore, 1897), and increased use of maize in the diet as observed in coastal bioarchaeological assemblages (Larsen et al., 2002; Thomas, 2008c).These changes have not been adequately explained.The current, implicit understanding is that these transformations occurred through an ill-defined, and incomplete, process of “Mississippianization” that arrived late on the Mississippian periphery (see Thomas, 2008a:309–312).I do not find the concept of Mississippianization to be clarifying here; what is important, however, is that adoption of the Mississippian iconographic lexicon and maize agriculture has been linked to processes of human movement (Beck, 2003; Blitz and Lorenz, 2002; Cobb and King, 2005; Pauketat, 2003; Willey, 1953; Williams, 1994).

Exploratory Bayesian modeling of settlement practices using a compiled set of legacy radiocarbon dates demonstrates that much of this expansion of settlement happened concomitant with the depopulation of the Savannah River Valley. The Georgia Coast seems a likely destination for former residents of the SRV, being easily reached via the Savannah River.Neighboring regions also appear to have received immigrants from the abandoned river valley.These regions surrounding the SRV, namely the Oconee, Pee Dee and Wateree river valleys, all experienced some degree of disruption coincident with abandonment of the SRV.Beck (2013) argued that the appearance of Late Mississippian Lamar ceramics from Georgia in the Carolina Piedmont, along with changes in the settlement system in that region, suggest that at least some former residents of the SRV made their way to the east.Similarly, Williams (1994) documented a population decline at the Shoulderbone site concomitant with the SRV abandonment and a complete depopulation of the site by 1450 CE.Some have suggested that Shoulderbone functioned as a protective buffer between the Oconee and Savannah River Valleys during a period of increasing political tensions (Anderson, 1994; Beck, 2013; Williams, 1994).However, after the SRV was abandoned, a defensive gateway settlement would have no longer been necessary.In addition, the Georgia Coast, like other coastal regions, was linked to the interior through the exchange of marine shell beads (Pearson and Cook, 2012; Trubitt, 2003).These exchange networks were likely mediated through matrimonial relationships, which have also been argued to structure migratory decision making (Brown and Kerber, 1990; Burmeister, 2000).Nevertheless, these lines of evidence, although compelling, are circumstantial.

Exploratory Bayesian modeling of settlement practices using a compiled set of legacy radiocarbon dates demonstrates that much of this expansion of settlement happened concomitant with the depopulation of the Savannah River Valley. Evidence of migration tends to be found at the scale of individual sites.In particular, ceramics and domestic architecture have been used as material correlates to identify population movements (e.g., De Roche, 1983; Haviland, 1972; Milner, 1986; Rouse, 1986; Stone, 2015; Warrick, 2008).Unfortunately, the archaeological record of the Georgia Coast does not include these necessary criteria.The Lamar-series ceramics noted by Beck (2013) in the Carolina Piedmont long precede the abandonment of the SRV on the Georgia Coast.In fact, a high degree of similarity in both temper and style in Mississippian ceramics across most of the state of Georgia suggests that the types of interpersonal connections that structure individual decisions that fundamentally comprise migration events had existed between several of the regions in question for some time.However, the presence of similar ceramic throughout much of Georgia during this time precludes identification of a classic “site-unit intrusion” (sensu Smith, 1984).Further, in the case of the Georgia Coast, our understanding of Late Prehistoric domestic architecture is limited by the small sample of excavated structures (see Keene and Garrison, 2013).Therefore, recognizing a large-scale population movement from the SRV to the Georgia Coast via these traditional methods is currently not possible.

Exploratory Bayesian modeling of settlement practices using a compiled set of legacy radiocarbon dates demonstrates that much of this expansion of settlement happened concomitant with the depopulation of the Savannah River Valley. Analysis of regional settlement data, along with a growing regional radiocarbon database, provides another method to evaluate population dynamics.I used both settlement analysis and Bayesian modeling of radiocarbon data to evaluate the character and timing of shifts in settlement practices on the Georgia Coast relative to the timing of abandonment of the Savannah River Valley.Determining the timing and nature of settlement changes will improve our understanding of these regional socio-political transformations and the role of immigration in those changes.

Exploratory Bayesian modeling of settlement practices using a compiled set of legacy radiocarbon dates demonstrates that much of this expansion of settlement happened concomitant with the depopulation of the Savannah River Valley. A number of approaches can be used to derive population estimates from settlement data.Warrick (2008) organized these approaches based on how closely the estimates approximate actual population numbers.At the grossest scale, population sizes can be estimated based on the carrying capacity of the environment, provided that information about environmental conditions and subsistence practices and technologies is available.This can be made more precise through inclusion of historical census data and material remains such as artifacts, food remains, and burial assemblages.

Exploratory Bayesian modeling of settlement practices using a compiled set of legacy radiocarbon dates demonstrates that much of this expansion of settlement happened concomitant with the depopulation of the Savannah River Valley. Settlement-based methods rely on ethnographic and ethnohistorical analogies, where archaeological measures of house and room counts, number of hearths, or total roofed area are related to specific numbers of people (Warrick, 2008:55–64).Such data are more difficult to obtain, requiring either extensive horizontal excavation or high-resolution, expansive shallow geophysical surveys where extant surface remains do not exist, such as in the American Southeast.Because contract archaeological survey projects contribute most of the settlement data available through state archaeological site files, these data are rarely available for conducting population reconstructions, especially at regional scales.
Ninety years ago in the Zagros foothills of Iraq, Dorothy Garrod and her team excavated Zarzi cave, the type site of the Epipalaeolithic “Zarzian” lithic industry. Garrod reported the existence of “two small fragments of obsidian” in the principally chert-based microlithic assemblage. One of the two artifacts from Zarzi was analyzed by Renfrew and colleagues in a pioneering application of obsidian sourcing to the Near East, which elucidated links between Neolithic villages. It was, unfortunately, ambiguously assigned to their “Group 4c” obsidian, which occurs at two different sources, ∼120 km apart, in eastern Turkey. New interpretive methods — agent-based models, least-cost path analysis, and others — have been applied to the datasets of Renfrew and colleagues, furthering work on the mechanisms of Neolithicization. With respect to the Epipalaeolithic, though, all of these studies rely entirely on this single Zarzi artifact with an inconclusive attribution. Fortunately, the second Zarzi obsidian “fragment” — a burin spall — was “rediscovered” at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard. Our study establishes that both artifacts came from Nemrut Dağ volcano, 400 km linearly and ≳650 km on foot. To do so, multivariate analyses were applied to the original spectroscopic data of Renfrew and colleagues, while state-of-the-art portable XRF was used to source the burin spall at Harvard's Peabody Museum. Comparison to two Epipalaeolithic sites in the Caucasus begins to reveal a patchwork of interaction spheres that highlight not only the potential of obsidian sourcing but also the considerable amount of work yet to be done. In the Mesopotamian highlands, the Epipalaeolithic (EP) — that is, the portion of the Upper Palaeolithic that falls between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 26.5 to ∼20 ka) and the start of the Neolithic (12 ka) — is a crucial period for investigating the rise of food production, sedentism, and other aspects of the so-called “Neolithic package.”This timeframe is even considered “Period 0” in the Atlas des Sites du Proche-Orient (ASPO) chronological scheme, devised by the Maison de l'Orient et de la Méditerranée, as a means to conceptualize the rise of Neolithic phenomena that culminated in urbanism (Hours et al., 1994; Aurenche et al., 2001).A variety of stimuli have been proposed for this “revolution” that appears, at least, to coincide with the beginning of the Holocene (∼11.65 ka).Braidwood's (1951) “hilly flanks” hypothesis posited that agriculture and sedentism arose in the foothills of the Taurus and Zagros mountain ranges, where fertile land enabled grain gathering and which coincided with the natural habitats for the wild forms of domesticates.Binford (1968) and Flannery (1969), in response to Braidwood, held that demographic pressures drove a shift to food production.Hayden (1992) suggested that feasting and other opulent displays drove agriculture.Individuals who could amass a food surplus were able to transform it into, for example, exotic and desirable objects, facilitating the rise of social inequality.Price and Bar-Yosef (2011) point out that each of these scenarios is “very much a chicken-egg question, like the issue of population pressure, of which came first” (S167).There is, though, an increasing recognition that certain aspects of the “Neolithic” package may have emerged at different times and places during the EP (e.g., Akkermans, 2004; Watkins, 2010; Weide et al., 2018).Consequently, “Period 0” is an important time in which to seek archaeological evidence that can be contrasted against Neolithic datasets.

Comparison to two Epipalaeolithic sites in the Caucasus begins to reveal a patchwork of interaction spheres that highlight not only the potential of obsidian sourcing but also the considerable amount of work yet to be done. Over the past five decades, obsidian artifact sourcing has played a vital role in revealing the interconnectedness of Neolithic communities across Mesopotamia.Renfrew et al. (1965) pioneered obsidian sourcing to investigate development of the Minoan state and Mycenaean Greece and their roles in Bronze Age exchange systems throughout the Aegean.Their technique was soon applied to the Neolithic revolution in the Near East (Renfrew et al., 1966, 1968).Of great interest at this time was how farming spread between villages, which were typically thought to have been fairly isolated during the early Neolithic.The spread of obsidian, however, showed that the settlements were not isolated and hinted that, as material moved, so too could have innovations.Specifically, Dixon et al. (1968) interpreted the resulting distribution patterns (i.e., “fall-off curves”) as evidence for “down-the-line” trade, in which obsidian moved among communities via a chain of interactions.Obsidian, they argued, can serve as an indicator of contacts between different Neolithic groups and might, in turn, define the type of their interactions.More recently, new interpretive methods — agent-based models and complex systems theory (Ortega et al., 2014, 2016; Ibáñez et al., 2015), least-cost path analysis (Barge et al., 2018), and network analysis (Batist, 2014) — have been applied to the data of Renfrew et al. (1966, 1968) and subsequent studies (see Cauvin and Chataigner, 1998; Batist, 2014; Moutsiou, 2014) to elucidate the mechanisms of Neolithicization.With respect to the EP, each of these studies relies on just one sourced — and ambiguously attributed — obsidian blade excavated from Zarzi cave in the Zagros foothills of the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq.

To do so, multivariate analyses were applied to the original spectroscopic data of Renfrew and colleagues, while state-of-the-art portable XRF was used to source the burin spall at Harvard's Peabody Museum. Comparison to two Epipalaeolithic sites in the Caucasus begins to reveal a patchwork of interaction spheres that highlight not only the potential of obsidian sourcing but also the considerable amount of work yet to be done. In 1928, immediately following her excavations at Gibraltar and ten years before she became the Disney Professor of Archaeology at the University of Cambridge (Caton-Thompson, 1969; Davies, 1999), Dorothy Garrod led an expedition to Iraqi Kurdistan, jointly funded by the Percy Sladen Memorial Fund of the Linnaean Society of London and the American School of Prehistoric Research (ASPR).Garrod's team included Charlotte A. Baynes and two ASPR representatives, Robert A. Franks, Jr. and Francis Turville-Petre (Garrod, 1930).Baynes and particularly Turville-Petre had experience in western Asia (Bar-Yosef and Callander, 1997), both having excavated Emireh and Zuttiyeh Caves in what is now Israel in 1925–1926 (Turville-Petre, 1927).Franks was a former ASPR field school student (Bricker, 2002), and based on archival data at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology (PMAE) at Harvard University, he played an important role as manager of ASPR funds in the field (PMAE 2015.0.32, ASPR records, Box 1, Folder 4; PMAE 995-3, George Grant MacCurdy photographic records, Box 8).The project's receipts and accounting data (PMAE 2015.0.32, ASPR records, Box 1, Folder 4) graphically, and depressingly, chronicle Turville-Petre's well-documented (Bar-Yosef and Callander, 1997) extreme levels of alcohol consumption.Garrod and her team excavated at Zarzi cave for nine days and the Hazar Merd caves for seventeen days.A follow-up excavation to complete the work at Hazar Merd and to conduct and expanded survey based around Halabja to the south was apparently planned for 1931 but canceled when the local antiquities department denied a research permit due to political instability (PMAE 2015.0.32, ASPR records, Box 1, Folder 4).By this time, Garrod and Turville-Petre were focused on excavations at Kebara and subsequently the multiple sites at the Wadi Mughara (Bar-Yosef and Callander, 1997; Garrod and Bate, 1937), and they never returned to Iraqi Kurdistan.
Ninety years ago in the Zagros foothills of Iraq, Dorothy Garrod and her team excavated Zarzi cave, the type site of the Epipalaeolithic “Zarzian” lithic industry. Garrod reported the existence of “two small fragments of obsidian” in the principally chert-based microlithic assemblage. One of the two artifacts from Zarzi was analyzed by Renfrew and colleagues in a pioneering application of obsidian sourcing to the Near East, which elucidated links between Neolithic villages. It was, unfortunately, ambiguously assigned to their “Group 4c” obsidian, which occurs at two different sources, ∼120 km apart, in eastern Turkey. New interpretive methods — agent-based models, least-cost path analysis, and others — have been applied to the datasets of Renfrew and colleagues, furthering work on the mechanisms of Neolithicization. With respect to the Epipalaeolithic, though, all of these studies rely entirely on this single Zarzi artifact with an inconclusive attribution. Fortunately, the second Zarzi obsidian “fragment” — a burin spall — was “rediscovered” at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard. Our study establishes that both artifacts came from Nemrut Dağ volcano, 400 km linearly and ≳650 km on foot.

Comparison to two Epipalaeolithic sites in the Caucasus begins to reveal a patchwork of interaction spheres that highlight not only the potential of obsidian sourcing but also the considerable amount of work yet to be done. At Zarzi, Garrod and her team encountered a stratigraphic horizon, Layer B, with microlithic artifacts.These artifacts composed “a typical Upper Aurignacian ensemble” that corresponded to “the final stage of the Upper Palaeolithic” (Garrod, 1930:22).Cherts were the most abundant lithic raw material, and she concluded that these cherts were primarily acquired as river cobbles because many of the cores retained weathered exterior surfaces.In total, she and her team recovered 648 complete or fragmented tools, nearly two thirds of which were notched blades (29.3%) and scrapers (34.7%).Garrod (1930) briefly mentioned that, among the lithic artifacts, “two small fragments of obsidian were found” (16).She did not elaborate, and as noted by Wahida (1981), Garrod's notebooks for the site have gone missing over the decades.The Zarzi collections were dispersed among multiple institutions, including the Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (CMAA) in the UK (accession numbers 1930-7-19).In the US, collections were shipped to institutions with strong connections to the ASPR, notably the PMAE (accession number 35-32-60), the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University (accession number YPM ANT 014376), and the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History (Petraglia and Potts, 2004).After the excavations at Zarzi and Hazar Merd in 1928, the collaboration between Garrod and the ASPR continued the following year with ASPR co-funding the ground-breaking Palaeolithic research at Tabun, el-Wad, and Skhul in the Wadi el-Mughara (Garrod and Bate, 1937).

Comparison to two Epipalaeolithic sites in the Caucasus begins to reveal a patchwork of interaction spheres that highlight not only the potential of obsidian sourcing but also the considerable amount of work yet to be done. One of the two Zarzi obsidian artifacts reappears in the literature in Renfrew and colleagues' application of obsidian sourcing to the Near East (Renfrew et al., 1966).Rather than simply being a “fragment,” Renfrew et al. (1966) list the Zarzi artifact as a blade, and it was one of 132 obsidian artifacts from 42 sites included in the study.It was also one of six artifacts contributed by the CMAA.The analyses, for which Renfrew and colleagues settled on optical emission spectroscopy (OES), were conducted in Cambridge's Department of Mineralogy and Petrology.Unfortunately, OES is partly destructive, necessitating specimens of ∼100 mg in the form of fine powder (Renfrew et al., 1965).It is uncertain how much of the artifact may have been taken as a sample, but the CMAA catalog lists only “a chip of obsidian” among microliths (e.g., crescents, triangles, and backed pieces) from Zarzi.Renfrew et al. (1966) attributed the blade to their “Group 4c,” which included the obsidian from two sources in eastern Turkey: Nemrut Dağ volcano and a source near the city of Bingöl, which came to be known as the “Bingöl A” obsidian source (Cauvin et al., 1986).After the discovery of the latter, Renfrew et al. (1968) noted that Nemrut Dağ and Bingöl A obsidian are “difficult to distinguish… At present, therefore, obsidian of Group 4c may derive from either of these sources” (320).This had no effect on their large-scale reconstruction of Neolithic obsidian distribution (Fig. 1a).This ambiguity, however, is considerable when efforts to create high-resolution reconstructions remain predicated on this blade as the only sourced EP artifact (Fig. 1b; Barge et al., 2018).That is, this blade, despite its inconclusive origin, has, until now, remained the sole datum for “Period 0” in Mesopotamia.

Comparison to two Epipalaeolithic sites in the Caucasus begins to reveal a patchwork of interaction spheres that highlight not only the potential of obsidian sourcing but also the considerable amount of work yet to be done. The other Zarzi obsidian artifact basically disappeared from the literature.It was recently “rediscovered” at Harvard's PMAE during a search of their collections for Aurignacian materials to build a teaching collection.It turned up during this search because Garrod's original attribution of “upper Aurignacian” has been retained in the PMAE records database.The artifact — a burin spall — is one of 78 lithic tools and cores from Zarzi at the PMAE, that is, ∼12% of Garrod's excavated assemblage.A search through the museum's associated accession file (35-32) suggested how the Zarzi lithic artifacts arrived in their collection.In May of 1935, ASPR transferred >700 artifacts, recovered from their excavations at various sites across Europe and the Near East, from the University of Pennsylvania's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology to the PMAE.George MacCurdy, Director of ASPR, wrote to Donald Scott, Director of the PMAE, on May 15, 1935 regarding this loan.MacCurdy wrote that he was looking forward to seeing the collection on exhibit at the PMAE, and he also mentioned: “When we come [to visit], I shall bring along a proposition just received from Dorothy Garrod” (PMAE File 35-32).Garrod's proposition is likely how this set of Zarzi artifacts (as well as a number of lithics from her Hazar Merd excavations) came to the PMAE, where they have been ever since.
Geological and archaeological analysis of stone masonries in standing structures helps reveal information about use of natural resources. At the same time, the study of historical materials is useful for conservators and cultural heritage management. Geochemical and petrographic analysis of building material types is usually done through destructive analysis on a few selected samples and can be problematic due to the costs of operations and the size of buildings themselves. This paper demonstrates that the combination of hyperspectral imaging portable Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (ED-XRF) spectroscopy can be useful for analysing types of raw materials used in distinct construction phases of the inner defensive wall in the citadel of Carcassonne (Aude, France). Stratigraphic analysis of the architecture, short-range spectral remote sensing and portable ED-XRF measurements were combined in an interdisciplinary approach to classify sandstone elements. The experimental protocol for in situ non-destructive analysis and classification of the masonry types allows the investigation of the monument in a diachronic perspective, collecting information to delineate raw materials varieties and their use or re-use through time.

The experimental protocol for in situ non-destructive analysis and classification of the masonry types allows the investigation of the monument in a diachronic perspective, collecting information to delineate raw materials varieties and their use or re-use through time. In this paper, we explore the possibilities of a close range application of hyperspectral image-based instruments, coupled with portable NIR probe and ED-XRF, to record and compare chemical signatures of stone elements in historical buildings.The combination of spectral features and elemental analysis is valuable to distinguish sandstone types according to their composition and mineral components.Our interdisciplinary approach to the study of constructions involves the indirect chemical characterization of stone elements associated to the stratigraphic analysis of standing structures in order to delineate the story of a monument contextualised in the surrounding landscape.The association of raw material types and phases of construction helps in unravelling details of stone supply dynamics and organization of labour on the working site.
Newly emerging location-based social network (LBSN) services provide us with new platforms to share interests and individual experience based on their activity history. The problems of data sparsity and user distrust in LBSNs create a severe challenge for traditional recommender systems. Moreover, users’ behaviors in LBSNs show an obvious spatio-temporal pattern. Valuable extra information from microblog-based social networks (MBSNs) can be utilized to improve the effectiveness of POI suggestion. In this study, we propose a latent probabilistic generative model called MTAS, which can accurately capture the underlying information in users’ words extracted from both LBSNs and MBSNs by taking into consideration the decision probability, a latent variable indicating a user’s tendency to publish a review in LBSNs or MBSNs. Then, the parameters of the MTAS model can be inferred by the Gibbs sampling method in an effective manner. Based on MTAS, we design an effective framework to fulfill the top-k suggestion. Extensive experiments on two real geo-social networks show that MTAS achieves better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods. Recent years have witnessed a blooming of Web 2.0, positioning systems and wireless communication technologies.Location based social networks (LBSNs), such as Foursquare2  and Yelp3  have become a popular application and facilitated users’ daily life.People can expand circles of friends, share their real experience and post reviews, photos and videos.As a significant tool of LBSNs, suggestion methods learn users’ preferences from their historical records and meta-data such as social relationship and review content, then suggest underlying points-of-interest (POIs) to the specific users.POI suggestion can benefit advertising agencies with an effective way of launching advertisements to the potential consumers, and improve user viscosity to LBSN service providers as well (Zhao et al., 2016a).

Extensive experiments on two real geo-social networks show that MTAS achieves better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods. One of the troublesome problems in POI suggestion is data sparsity (Xie et al., 2016), especially in out-of-town areas.It stems from incompleteness of reviews posted in the LBSNs and degrades the accuracy of POI suggestion.When a user visits an area in his city or an out-of-town place which he is not familiar with, this problem becomes extremely severe and LBSNs can hardly suggest ideal results.

Meanwhile, the loose relationship of users in LBSNs make the suggestion results in out-of-town scenario trustless.Users are declined to trust friends in LBSNs since they usually have different backgrounds and interests.MBSNs (Microblog-Based Social Networks) (Xiong et al., 2018) such as Facebook and Twitter are platforms for users to communicate with close friends and share their current status.Sufficient valuable information is generated and can be used for POI suggestion.A typical application scenario is illustrated in Fig. 1.Due to the data sparsity of LBSNs, users are able to acquire extra information from Twitter, a MBSN, which can help a user make a more accurate decision.A geo-social network can be viewed as a heterogeneous information system (Bu et al., 2019; Cao et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019) composed of a LBSN and a MBSN.

Users’ preferences in LBSNs show some temporal and geographical patterns.POIs with similar attributes are usually clustered in a specific region.For instance, users prefer to visiting a street with more restaurants which can provide more choices, that is, a user’s visited places are often clustered together.A user is more likely to visit places nearby rather than the distant ones.Moreover, a user tends to visit a place at right time, e.g., he is more likely to visit a restaurant at lunch time rather than a cinema.Thus the spatio-temporal factors should be taken into account when suggesting POIs.

Extensive experiments on two real geo-social networks show that MTAS achieves better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods. Inspired by these motivation, we introduce a latent probabilistic generative model called Multi-source Topic Awareness Suggestion (MTAS) to fuse the information from geo-social networks.Fig. 2 shows the basic idea of the proposed MTAS model.The geo-social network can be classified into four distinct information layers, and each layer corresponds to a part of “4W” (i.e., who, when, where and what) information structure.The content layer represents reviews from users; the social layer indicates different topologies of relationships between users in LBSNs and MBSNs, which generates different kinds of communities; the geographical layer and temporal layer show the spatio-temporal information of a posting event.The behavior of posting reviews about POIs bridges the gap between online social networks and offline physical world.Given a review, a layer link connects these four layers.An anchor link connects two different accounts of one user in a LBSN and a MBSN, respectively.

Extensive experiments on two real geo-social networks show that MTAS achieves better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods. In order to study the applicability of MTAS, we explore its working mechanism and performance in two scenarios: (1) home-town suggestion is supposed that a specific user is located at his familiar regions such as his living or working areas.He appeals to suggestion services of LBSNs for new suggestion based on his activity records.(2) out-of-town suggestion satisfies the needs of users who travel to distant and unfamiliar areas.LBSNs can still suggest some POIs to the users but the results seem unreliable.It should be noticed that both the suggestion scenarios have its own spatio-temporal features.

(1) We model the multiple geo-social influence from social communities, time intervals and geographical locations to the textual content of reviews in both LBSNs and MBSNs based on the following facts: (a) users from a community might be interested in POIs located in the same region due to their frequent online communication; (b) the activity time of a community’s members tend to be tightly connected with each other; (c) a better POI suggestion result for a specific user can be inferred from review content extracted from LBSNs and MBSNs.

Duplication of the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) is a rare condition that results in epilepsy in half of the cases. Although this condition has been well characterized in the literature, there is a lack of research on MECP2 duplication-related epilepsy and its management. We present the case of an eleven-year old male with MECP2 duplication and epilepsy, who was resistant to polytherapy. The patient responded well to valproic acid (VPA) initially and upon re-challenge. This case report provides evidence for the use of VPA as an initial monotherapy for treatment of drug-resistant MECP2 duplication-related epilepsy. Duplications of Xq28 involving the methyl CpG binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) causes 0.5 to 2% of X-linked developmental disabilities and are predominantly inherited with full penetrance in males [1].More severe mutations in MECP2 are lethal in males.Females with point mutations in MECP2 present with Rett syndrome.MECP2 duplication syndrome has been well-described in patients with mental retardation, absent to minimal speech, hypotonia replaced by progressive spasticity and/or ataxia, mild facial dysmorphisms (brachycephaly, large face, midface hypoplasia, depressed nasal bridge, upturned nares), severe recurrent respiratory infections, and in some cases, death before 25 years of age [2].

Approximately half of patients with MECP2 duplication also present with epilepsy, although this varies with age.Seizures generally develop in late childhood and early adolescence.Seizures present as polymorphic crises (absences, focal seizures, generalized tonic–clonic) or myoclonic or myoclonic–astatic forms with drop attacks [3].The onset of seizures is thought to correlate with neurological deterioration including loss of speech and motor skills.

To date, there are 151 reported patients with MECP2 duplication syndrome, 87 of whom also have epilepsy.For a full summary of the case studies and outcomes, see Table 1.Most of the cases described demonstrate that MECP2-related epilepsy is refractory to pharmacotherapy [4] or there was no reported response.In one case report [5], the patient responded to valproic acid initially, but seizures recurred after two years.Caumes et al. [4] reported seven patients on VPA, only one of which responded with complete control of atypical absence seizures at the 3-year follow-up.In another more recent study [6], two patients showed response with complete resolution of seizures with VPA in one case and a combination of VPA, Clobazam, and Lamotrigine in the other case.Limited research exists on patient attributes and epilepsy characteristics that make these patients responsive to therapy.
Multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) typically assumes that crowds make completely rational decisions. In MCDM, a crowd as a whole, or its individual members, generally make decisions free from any influence of valence, arousal, emotional state or environment. In contrast, various theories dealing with crowd psychology (Gustave Le Bon, Freudian, Deindividuation, Convergence, Emergent norm, Social identity) analyze, in one form or another, the emotions of the crowd. According to above theories, crowd is influenced by a range of behavioral factors, such as physical, social, psychological, culture, norms, and emotions. It can be argued that the emotional state, valence and arousal of crowds affect their decision making to a considerable degree and multiple criteria crowd behavior modeling must, therefore, consider this impact as well. In this light, the integration of crowd simulation and biometric methods, behavioral operations research and emotions in decision making has taken a prominent place as it leads to a better understanding of crowd emotions and crowd decision making. In this context, the authors developed the Affective Analytics of Demonstration Sites (ANDES) that added to this body of research in four ways. The crowd analysis and simulations conducted with ANDES used a neuro decision matrix. The matrix contains a detailed description of demonstration sites (public spaces) in question and the emotions, valence, arousal and physiological parameters of people present there. With ANDES’s Remote Sensor Network, emotional (emotions, valence, arousal) and physiological (average crowd facial temperature, crowd composition by gender and age group, etc.) parameters of people present at demonstration sites can be mapped. ANDES can assist experts in more effective implementations of public spaces planning and a participation process by attendees by collecting and examining various layers of data on the emotional and physiological parameters of visitors based on a visitors-centric public spaces planning approach. ANDES can determine the public space and real estate values. Both scholars and practitioners have been attempting over the past century to evaluate the emotions of residents quantitatively.Such data was meant for practical applications when executing important events and exhibitions and when planning public spaces and cities.For example, Saroff and Levitan (1969) use opinion surveys and sampling methods in the urban planning process.They have analyzed various quantitative and qualitative data, while paying special attention to human emotions.The techniques, technologies and systems for planners during these times were mostly limited to questionnaires, interviews and the like, but there were no tools for analyzing emotions in an urban setting and public spaces (Zeile et al., 2015, 2016).Throughout the development of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, technologies emerged for applying remote biometrics and physiological measures of emotions at events, exhibitions and public spaces in real time.Nonetheless, to date, the use of remote biometrics and physiological systems is rare.These emerged biometrics technologies could support studies on the human emotions and people’s physiological states found in the public spaces along with human circadian rhythm, weather conditions, pollution in a combined way.Then applications of such data along with information and mining outcomes could serve as additional knowledge for the planning objectives of events, exhibitions and public spaces.Such is the purpose of this research involved in developing the Affective Analytics of Demonstration Sites (ANDES).
Multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) typically assumes that crowds make completely rational decisions. In MCDM, a crowd as a whole, or its individual members, generally make decisions free from any influence of valence, arousal, emotional state or environment. In contrast, various theories dealing with crowd psychology (Gustave Le Bon, Freudian, Deindividuation, Convergence, Emergent norm, Social identity) analyze, in one form or another, the emotions of the crowd.

(2014), crowd behavior models are divided into agent-based, flow-based and particle-based depending on whether the behavior appears as simulating all persons separately, is programmatically defined a priori applying a fluid dynamics models, or using a particle system subject to physical laws.Zhou et al. (2010) stated that current crowd models and simulation systems can be incompletely characterized by applying a two-dimensional taxonomy determined by crowd scope and time dimensions.

Particle systems are also used in a number of artificial intelligent based crowd simulation methods: personality-based models (Guy et al., 2011); the stress-based model (Kim et al., 2012); guiding crowd simulations applying navigation fields (Patil et al., 2011); scalable simulations (Vigueras et al., 2008); modeling individual behaviors (Braun et al., 2003); and leader behavior during evacuation simulations (Pelechano and Badler, 2006).

Various theories dealing with crowd psychology (Gustave Le Bon, Freudian, Deindividuation, Convergence, Emergent norm, Social identity) analyze, in one form or another, the emotions of the crowd.Numerous crowd modeling methods have been used taking into account the crowd’s emotions and arousal.Videos and videogames in this field have been created for smart cities (Hossain et al., 2018), architecture and urban planning (Drettakis et al., 2007; Aschwanden et al., 2011), a crowd’s expressive emotional states and their connection with behavioral tendencies (Li et al., 2014), evacuation simulation (Vasudevan and Son, 2011; Shiwakoti and Sarvi, 2013; Wang et al., 2015; Tancogne-Dejean and Laclémence, 2016), productivity (Vasudevan and Son, 2011), crowd management prediction and intervention (Martella et al., 2017), sports crowd violence (Spaaij, 2014), negative and positive experiences in crowds (Filingeri et al., 2017).For example, Li et al. (2014) established a set of 13 crowd emotional feelings and examined their connection with 11 behavioral trends in both event and non-event crowd circumstances.With the innovations and increasing popularity of smart cities, video analytics (e.g., from social media, entertainment, surveillance, smart health monitoring, and crowd management) are used in a range of applications to provide safety, security, and well-being for residents.As these video analytics are shared through highly interconnected devices, sensors, and other smart city stakeholders, security and integrity is a concern for secure video content (Hossain et al., 2018).

The analytics of crowd management endeavor to assist in implementing the main objectives of crowd use of public spaces as well as to assure public security by targeting detection, analysis and explanation of significant patterns in crowd activities data.Stakeholders can use crowd management analytics to define, predict and improve management of expected and unexpected crowd activities.

Crowd management modeling is an instrument for virtually examining the behavior of a crowd under analysis and obtaining a mathematical model that allows forecasting the behavior of a crowd by virtue of a system of parameters and constraints.Such modeling seeks to assist implementations of the main objectives of crowd use of public spaces that are more effective as well as assuring public security.Interested parties can apply crowd management modeling in order to develop typical scenarios for crowd models and to select the best.Additionally, by varying variables in the modeling, expected and unexpected crowd management alternatives can be forecast.

Spaaij (2014) observed how themes and subjects coming from diverse disciplines may be brought together to produce a completer, multi-level (individual, interpersonal, situational, social environmental) investigation that incorporates distal and proximate causes of sports crowd violence.Aschwanden et al. (2011) recommended a system to simulate, investigate and visualize the behavior of inhabitants and artificial agents (i.e., pedestrians, cars, and public transport vehicles) in city surroundings by joining parametric modeling and agent-based simulation.Filingeri et al. (2017) analyzed factors influencing negative and positive experiences in crowds.In the current study, the effects on participant involvement in crowds are identified in focus groups and explanations are discussed: physical plan of crowd area and amenities, crowd displacement, communication and information, comfort and well-being.

(2013), human behavior investigation in video surveillance is difficult, due to the variety of individual appearances, the number of persons measured, the changing contextual circumstances, and the types of sensors engaged.Lately, Social Signal Processing focuses mainly on nonverbal cues, like face expressions and gazing, body posture and gestures, vocal features, comparative distances in the space and others (Cristani et al., 2013).

The H2020 ROCK (Regeneration and Optimization of Cultural heritage in creative and Knowledge cities) project aims to develop an innovative, collaborative and circular systemic approach for the regeneration and adaptive reuse of historic city centers.The ROCK project plans innovative re-use of historic buildings and public spaces with high cultural potential.The ROCK project aims at developing ICT infrastructure to promote synergies, strengthen places of interest, transform the historic area into a knowledge, culture and technology-driven hub, contribute to a creative innovative re-use of historic buildings, cultural equipment, and unused spaces with high cultural potential, improve knowledge sharing, and create new and innovative ways of using cultural heritage.Within the framework of the ROCK project, Affective Analytics of Demonstration Sites were developed.

One of the main objectives of this research was multiple criteria analysis of cultural heritage demonstration sites (public spaces) (buildings, public spaces, events, streets) with the help of integrated behavioral operations research, emotions in decision-making, crowd simulation and biometric methods to gain further insight into the processes happening within crowds.The above mentioned and other studies suggest that a more thorough analysis of cultural heritage (CH) demonstration sites (buildings, public spaces, events, streets) requires the use of a neuro decision matrix (criteria, their values and weights) with a detailed description of the object in question and the emotions, valence, arousal and physiological parameters of people present at the site.Based on this neuro decision matrix, real-time mapping of the emotional (emotions, valence, arousal) and physiological (average crowd facial temperature, crowd composition by sex and age group, etc.) parameters of people present at CH demonstration sites (public spaces) should be conducted and the maps then used as a reference to offer stakeholder groups personalized tips on ways to make the demonstration sites more efficient.The neuro decision matrix and affective and physiological maps could also serve as input in determining the value of a public space value of a public space.The achievement of these goals would help forward innovative creative re-use of historic buildings and public spaces with high cultural potential, strengthen places of interest, transform historic areas into knowledge, culture and technology-driven hubs, and improve knowledge sharing.Within the framework of the ROCK project, Affective Analytics of Demonstration Sites were developed.
This work examines the carbon and nitrogen composition of human and animal collagen from the Roman necropolis of Lucus Feroniae (Rome, 1st–3rd century AD) and the Longobard cemetery of La Selvicciola in northern Latium (Viterbo, 7th century AD), with a special focus on possible dietary variations at the transition between classical and post-classical times. A substantial isotopic difference between the two series reveals distinct dietary practices at the two sites, especially the consumption of cereals and contribution of other foodstuffs to a mainly grain-based diet. We argue that such differences are explained through the social and cultural background of the two populations examined, where the isotopic variance of the Roman data is in line with that of a group of heterogeneous origin and varied dietary practices, while the tight clustering of isotopic signatures for the Longobard people reflects the foodways of a homogeneous group. Intra-site variation shows no significant difference according to the sex of the deceased. Outlying individuals might be explained through cultural practices that call for further insight. Isotopic data have shown to successfully reflect social and cultural phenomena of human groups in a changing world, in a way that other archaeological proxies have sometimes failed to achieve. There are no isotopic works in Europe focusing on the transition from classical to post-classical times.While most isotopic studies concentrate either on the first period (Chenery et al. 2010; Fuller et al. 2006; Prowse et al. 2005; Prowse et al. 2004) or the latter (Bourbou et al. 2011; Hakenbeck et al. 2010; Müldner and Richards 2005; Reitsema et al. 2010; Richards et al. 2006) a diachronic perspective is still lacking.However, the transition to the post-classical times is one of important changes, which involved a shift in social and economic aspects of everyday life for most populations in the western world.Health status and life conditions changed dramatically and human groups faced periods of instability that, among other aspects, are also testified in population replacement (Amorim et al. 2018).In Italy, in particular, with the fall of the Western Roman Empire (476 CE), the Gothic war and the following Byzantine domination, the contribution of Longobard migration to the Peninsula had a profound impact on the cultural as well as genetic background of the Italian people (Melucco Vaccaro, 1988; Rotili 2010).

Isotopic data have shown to successfully reflect social and cultural phenomena of human groups in a changing world, in a way that other archaeological proxies have sometimes failed to achieve. Paleobiological data obtained earlier from two skeletal series in the area or Rome (Manzi et al. 1995; Salvadei et al. 1995; Sperduti et al. 1995), prove a clear discontinuity in health status at the transition to the post-classical world.In this perspective a paleodietary investigation, through stable carbon and nitrogen analysis of human bone collagen of the same series, might contribute to understanding the social and economic implication that such a transition entailed.

Micarelli et al. 2018).

This paper aims to identify possible changes in human diet using stable carbon and nitrogen analysis of bone collagen.The populations buried at the two sites, should in fact reflect very different paleodietary stories.Lucus Feroniae, despite being a rural town on the outskirts of Rome was still part of its rich Province between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD.According to various scholars (Garnsey 1989; Gazzetti 1985) the population here was extremely heterogeneous, characterized by slaves, freedmen and veterans.Such heterogeneity might have resulted in a variety of diets practiced at the site, either in relation to access to foods or to the diverse origins and social background of the individuals considered.Furthermore, a selection of resources could have either been produced locally or imported via the many ports that served Rome at the time.Selvicciola, on the other hand, is the cemetery of a Longobard tribe, an allochthonous group occupying a declining territory at the end of the 6th century AD (Incitti 1997), with its own social and economic habitus; if some intermixing with the locals might have occurred, this was during a period of severe decline in Italy, where local populations were exiting the long phase of the Gothic War and undergoing a period of general impoverishment and crisis (Christie 1998; Giostra 2011).
Archaeological materials in museum collections provide an excellent opportunity for researchers to investigate social, cultural, and environmental change. However, the precision of the archaeological analysis and interpretation is dependent on a firm understanding of the site chronology. The Par-Tee site (35CLT20), located on the northern Oregon Coast, produced a large archaeological collection including artifacts and faunal remains excavated in the 1960s and 1970s. Radiocarbon dates have been obtained on materials from the Par-Tee collections by several different researchers since the 1970s, but these data have not been adequately assessed for chronometric hygiene. To establish a reliable chronology for the Par-Tee site, we obtained new high-resolution accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates and collagen peptide mass fingerprinting of cervid bones from throughout the site. We evaluate these new radiocarbon dates along with previous radiocarbon dates from the site, using chronometric hygiene assessments and Bayesian statistics to build a refined chronology for the Par-Tee site and museum collection. Previous research suggests site habitation occurred between 350 cal BC to cal AD 1150. Our reassessment of the site chronology suggests the primary site habitation occurred from cal AD ~100–800. We also identified evidence of subsequent site occupation around cal AD ~1490–1635 supporting previous interpretations of site habitation after the primary shell midden forming occupation. The latter occupation may be associated with a change in site use from a semi-sedentary village to a cemetery. Museum-based archaeological research offers access to unique archaeological materials sometimes unobtainable through modern studies—a result of the often large-scale of late-nineteenth and early twentieth-century excavations.Although concerns of decreasing museum repository space are increasing (Bawaya, 2007), anthropological research of museum collections is addressing a diverse range of anthropological, biological, and conservation issues (Sholts et al., 2016).Collections-based studies, however, can be complicated by the differential excavation, recovery, and curation histories of museum collections (Bawaya, 2007; Pearce, 1994).As Luby et al. (2013) note, these early museum assemblages endure as legacy collections rather than as “old” excavation materials.The term legacy highlights the inherent value and the importance of museum collections from the perspective of stewardship, research, and education.
Archaeological materials in museum collections provide an excellent opportunity for researchers to investigate social, cultural, and environmental change. However, the precision of the archaeological analysis and interpretation is dependent on a firm understanding of the site chronology. The Par-Tee site (35CLT20), located on the northern Oregon Coast, produced a large archaeological collection including artifacts and faunal remains excavated in the 1960s and 1970s. Radiocarbon dates have been obtained on materials from the Par-Tee collections by several different researchers since the 1970s, but these data have not been adequately assessed for chronometric hygiene. To establish a reliable chronology for the Par-Tee site, we obtained new high-resolution accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates and collagen peptide mass fingerprinting of cervid bones from throughout the site. We evaluate these new radiocarbon dates along with previous radiocarbon dates from the site, using chronometric hygiene assessments and Bayesian statistics to build a refined chronology for the Par-Tee site and museum collection. Previous research suggests site habitation occurred between 350 cal BC to cal AD 1150. Our reassessment of the site chronology suggests the primary site habitation occurred from cal AD ~100–800. We also identified evidence of subsequent site occupation around cal AD ~1490–1635 supporting previous interpretations of site habitation after the primary shell midden forming occupation. The latter occupation may be associated with a change in site use from a semi-sedentary village to a cemetery. Prior to initiating museum-based studies on legacy collections, conservation, rehousing, and basic inventorying of an assemblage may need to be completed—potentially deterring researchers from museum studies (Luby et al., 2013).Museum-based research also requires understanding museum-specific catalog systems, collections processing, and field sampling strategies, the availability of associated field notes and photographs, and deaccessioning practices (Huster, 2013; Luby et al., 2013; Voss, 2012).Despite these and other obstacles, analysis of archaeological museum collections is an important pursuit, where large collections can be analyzed on their own, or supplement new excavations at a site (Crowell, 2000; Luby et al., 2013; Rick, 2007).

The latter occupation may be associated with a change in site use from a semi-sedentary village to a cemetery. One of the biggest issues when conducting museum-based research—and in archaeology more generally—is establishing the chronology of an assemblage or site (Buck et al., 1991; Finstad et al., 2013; Schweikhardt et al., 2011).Frequently in legacy collections, older radiocarbon (14C) measurements were made on composite or bulk samples of charcoal, shell, or bone.Often, samples were not corrected for isotopic fractionation; isotopic ratios were estimated rather than measured, or dates have high standard deviations that make them problematic for building chronologies (Ashmore, 1999; Bronk Ramsey et al., 2004; Stuiver and Polach, 1977; Taylor, 1991).After proper chronometric hygiene assessments of existing 14C dates, it is often desirable for archaeologists to obtain new AMS dates for sites, building potentially higher resolution chronological sequences of legacy collections (Kennett et al., 2014; Luby et al., 2013).Bayesian analysis of high-precision AMS 14C dates provides an important framework for enhancing the interpretation of existing collections and increasing their broader value to the scientific community (Bronk Ramsey et al., 2004; Jew et al., 2015; Kennett et al., 2011; Thulman, 2017).
A large amount of well-preserved timbers was found during several archaeological excavations of the Faravel mining site (Southern French Alps, between 1950- and 2150 m a.s.l.). 232 of these timbers were sampled for dendrochronological analysis and 67% of them were dated. These 156 larch (Larix decidua Mill.) series, crossdated against existing reference chronologies, were averaged for a site chronology spanning from 777 to 1243. From this dataset, 33 timbers with (almost) complete sapwood allowed us to obtain tree felling years with seasonal resolution. The chronological distribution of these felling years highlights nine distinct mining phases that occurred between 1059 and 1243, revealing a discontinuous exploitation of the study site during the medieval period. In addition, the presence of late wood in the vast majority of complete samples, demonstrates that logging mainly occurred during late fall and early winter. These results, combined with historical, palynological and archaeological investigations, plead for short, seasonal, and low-intensity, mining campaigns, mainly carried out after the bulk of agropastoral activities using rudimentary techniques with limited impact on the forest cover. Medieval wood is frequently perfectly preserved and abundant (Bailly-Maître, 2008a; Tegel, 2012).At that time, wood was required for carpentry works and manufacturing equipment (floors, ladders, hoists, dragging roads, timbered shafts etc.).Mines are generally closed environments saturated with humidity and protected from light and temperature variations.Therefore, wood does not decompose as fast as it would in open-air, particularly when it is located in submerged and/or backfilled works.Numerous pieces of preserved wood have allowed dendrochronologists to build reliable and powerful cross-dated site chronologies for dating and for revealing phases of mining activity.Moreover, wood analyses can provide information about how species were selected for different uses, the mechanical properties and qualities of the selected wood, and forest management.In addition, tool traces may provide information about the tools and techniques used by miners for tree felling, debarking, limb removal, length reduction, and shaping.Consequently, dendrochronological analyses of mining sites are of high interest not only to dendrochronologists but also to archaeologists and historians.

Despite this, dendrochronological studies performed on medieval mine timbering and wood equipment are relatively scarce in France.Furthermore, although dendrochronological dating is frequently used in mining archaeology, the literature focusing on this topic is rare.Usually, case studies are included in research monographs.More rarely, they consist in review studies of reference sites through pioneering dendrochronological studies on mines (Bailly-Maître, 1997, 2002, 2008b; Bailly-Maître and Bruno-Dupraz, 1994; Benoît, 1997).Most frequently, dendrochronological contributions are restricted to the presentation of date ranges, allowing archaeologists to establish a chronology of specific mining works or special equipment, such as haulage roads (Bohly, 2008).In rare cases, they allow the characterisation of mining works progression with a yearly resolution (Bailly-Maître, 2002).In order to include more studies dedicated to dendrochronological analyses of wood preserved in mines, we must embrace a broader geographical area as well as a longer chronological period, ranging from prehistoric to modern times (Cauuet, 2000, 2001, 2008; Lavier et al., 1996; Pierre et al., 2008).Detailed studies have been conducted in the largest European mining regions (Poland, Austria, Italia and Germany) such as Lower Silesia (Szychowska-Kąrpiec, 2007), Tyrol (Pichler et al., 2009, 2011, 2013), Hallstatt (Ruoff and Sormaz, 1998, 2000; Grabner et al., 2007), Styria (Stöllner, 2009; Stöllner et al., 2011) or the Black Forest (Tegel, 2012).Only a few specific studies have been carried out in North America (Hattori and Thompson, 1987; Quann et al., 2010).Yet, owing to the lack of stratigraphic data, the relationship between dendrochronological dates and archaeological events has not been fully exploited.

For the Alpine region, previous dendrochronological studies of mining sites have provided large datasets related to the identification of species, and helped build centennial-long master chronologies and understand forest management history from prehistorical (Pichler et al., 2009, 2013) to historical times (Py et al., 2014).The present study transcends current knowledge.Through dendrochronological analyses of felling phases, it aims to characterise (i) mining rhythmicity, and (ii) work organisation and progression, and human practices during a whole century-long period.This high-resolution analysis was conducted in the Upper Durance valley (Southern French Alps), at the Faravel polymetallic district presenting with ore deposits containing chalcopyrite, argentiferous galena and blende, for which written archives of mining activity in the 12th (1169) and 15th centuries (1484) and archaeological evidence between the 10th and 13th centuries are available.
Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived liver modeling systems have the potential to overcome the shortage of donors for clinical application and become a model for drug development. Although several strategies are available to generate hepatic micro-tissues, few have succeeded in generating a liver organoid with hepatobiliary structure from hiPSCs. At differentiation stages I and II (day 1–15), 25% of mTeSR™ culture medium was added to hepatic differentiation medium to induce endodermal and mesodermal commitment and thereafter hepatic and biliary co-differentiation. At stage III (day 15–45), 10% cholesterol+ MIX was added to the maturation medium to promote the formation and maturation of the hepatobiliary organoids. Phenotypes and functions of organoids were determined by specific markers and multiple functional assays both in vitro and in vivo. In this system, hiPSCs were induced to form 3D hepatobiliary organoids and to some extent recapitulated key aspects of early hepatogenesis in a parallel fashion. The organoids displayed a series of functional attributes. Specifically, the induced hepatocyte-like cells could take up indocyanine green, accumulate lipid and glycogen, and displayed appropriate secretion ability (albumin and urea) and drug metabolic ability (CYP3A4 activity and inducibility); the biliary structures in the system showed gamma glutamyltransferase activity and the ability to efflux rhodamine and store bile acids. Furthermore, after transplantation into the immune-deficient mice, the organoids survived for more than 8 weeks. This is the first time that functional hepatobiliary organoids have been generated from hiPSCs. The organoid model will be useful for in vitro studies of the molecular mechanisms of liver development and has important potential in the therapy of liver diseases. To date, most of the pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-based liver modeling systems have initiated differentiation from highly purified definitive endoderm (DE) and have generated monolayer hepatocyte-like cells.1–5However, preclinical predictions from such models are usually difficult to interpret, and may be misleading, because homogeneous DE populations are insufficient to accurately replicate the complex regulation of signals among cells and tissues during liver organogenesis.6A recent study, which mimicked liver development by combining hepatic endoderm cells with endothelial cells and mesenchymal progenitors, resulted in the generation of a liver bud-like structure with improved function.7Similarly, co-culture of fetal liver progenitor cells and liver extracellular matrix triggered the formation of hepatocytes with bile duct-like structures.8These findings highlighted the importance of multicellular interactions during early liver development.However, these studies combined cells that were isolated from multiple and postnatal individuals, suggesting a severe limitation of the transplanting applications based on these strategies.
Terbinafine is an antifungal agent that has been associated with rare instances of hepatotoxicity. In this study we aimed to describe the presenting features and outcomes of patients with terbinafine hepatotoxicity and to investigate the role of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*33:01. Consecutive high causality cases of terbinafine hepatotoxicity enrolled into the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network were reviewed. DNA samples underwent high-resolution confirmatory HLA sequencing using the Ilumina MiSeq platform. All 15 patients with terbinafine hepatotoxicity were more than 40 years old (median = 57 years), 53% were female and the median latency to onset was 38 days (range 24 to 114 days). At the onset of drug-induced liver injury, 80% were jaundiced, median serum alanine aminotransferase was 448 U/L and alkaline phosphatase was 333 U/L. One individual required liver transplantation for acute liver failure during follow-up, and 7 of the 13 (54%) remaining individuals had ongoing liver injury at 6 months, with 4 demonstrating persistently abnormal liver biochemistries at month 24. High-resolution HLA genotyping confirmed that 10 of the 11 (91%) European ancestry participants were carriers of the HLA-A*33:01, B*14:02, C*08:02 haplotype, which has a carrier frequency of 1.6% in European Ancestry population controls. One African American patient was also an HLA-A*33:01 carrier while 2 East Asian patients were carriers of a similar HLA type: A*33:03. Molecular docking studies indicated that terbinafine may interact with HLA-A*33:01 and A*33:03. Patients with terbinafine hepatotoxicity most commonly present with a mixed or cholestatic liver injury profile and frequently have residual evidence of chronic cholestatic injury. A strong genetic association of HLA-A*33:01 with terbinafine drug-induced liver injury was confirmed amongst Caucasians. Terbinafine is an orally administered antifungal agent that is commonly used to treat superficial fungal infections of the skin and nails.It was approved for use in the United States in 1998 and is typically given in an oral dose of 250 mg daily for 6 to 12 weeks.Terbinafine use is associated with mild liver biochemistry abnormalities in <1% of treated patients.However, the incidence of clinically significant liver injury attributed to terbinafine is not known because of a lack of sensitive and reliable means to detect hepatotoxicity in a prospective, population-based cohort.The liver injury may be hepatocellular at initial presentation but usually evolves into a cholestatic profile over time.1United States Hypersensitivity and autoimmune features are uncommon and some studies suggest that a reactive metabolite may be involved that can accumulate in the bile.2In addition, rare instances of severe hepatitis, acute liver failure and fatalities have been described with terbinafine use.3,4
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an idiopathic, chronic cholestatic liver disorder characterized by biliary inflammation and fibrosis. Increased numbers of intrahepatic interferon-γ- (IFNγ) producing lymphocytes have been documented in patients with PSC, yet their functional role remains to be determined. Liver tissue samples were collected from patients with PSC. The contribution of lymphocytes to liver pathology was assessed in Mdr2−/− x Rag1−/− mice, which lack T and B cells, and following depletion of CD90.2+ or natural killer (NK)p46+ cells in Mdr2−/− mice. Liver pathology was also determined in Mdr2−/− x Ifng−/− mice and following anti-IFNγ antibody treatment of Mdr2−/− mice. Immune cell composition was analysed by multi-colour flow cytometry. Liver injury and fibrosis were determined by standard assays. Patients with PSC showed increased IFNγ serum levels and elevated numbers of hepatic CD56bright NK cells. In Mdr2−/− mice, hepatic CD8+ T cells and NK cells were the primary source of IFNγ. Depletion of CD90.2+ cells reduced hepatic Ifng expression, NK cell cytotoxicity and liver injury similar to Mdr2−/− x Rag1−/− mice. Depletion of NK cells resulted in reduced CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity and liver fibrosis. The complete absence of IFNγ in Mdr2−/−x Ifng−/− mice reduced NK cell and CD8+ T cell frequencies expressing the cytotoxic effector molecules granzyme B and TRAIL and prevented liver fibrosis. The antifibrotic effect of IFNγ was also observed upon antibody-dependent neutralisation in Mdr2−/− mice. IFNγ changed the phenotype of hepatic CD8+ T cells and NK cells towards increased cytotoxicity and its absence attenuated liver fibrosis in chronic sclerosing cholangitis. Therefore, unravelling the immunopathogenesis of PSC with a particular focus on IFNγ might help to develop novel treatment options. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a poorly understood chronic progressive biliary disease of unknown aetiology, characterized by biliary inflammation and fibrosis, development of cholestasis, end-stage liver disease and a high risk of malignancy.Approximately 60% of patients with PSC are male and 70 to 80% have inflammatory bowel disease.Both the incidence and prevalence of PSC are increasing, indicating that current medical treatment is poorly effective.1

PSC has been recognized as an immune-mediated biliary disease.Genetic data provided insight into immunological loci belonging to a general pool of predisposing autoimmune risk factors, most strikingly human leukocyte antigen (HLA) associations that resemble prototypical autoimmune disorders.2This suggests that T cell-dependent, adaptive immune responses contribute to the immunopathogenesis of PSC.Indeed, dysregulation of apoptosis of activated CD4+ T cells3 and dysfunction of regulatory T cells4 have been observed in patients with PSC.Additionally, studies in patients with PSC showed increased T lymphocyte infiltration with a bias towards Th1 cells that localize around the bile ducts and portal tracts.5,6Moreover, elevated serum levels of the IFNγ-inducible chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 have been determined in patients with PSC,7 and biliary epithelial cells from patients with PSC express CXCL9, CXCL10 and the IFNγ-specific transcription factors STAT1 and IRF1.8

Mdr2−/− mice, bearing a targeted disruption of the multidrug resistance gene (Mdr2, Abcb4), have been recognized as a suitable model to study inflammatory biliary disease.9In fact, reflecting central morphological features observed in livers of patients with PSC, biliary inflammation, ductular proliferation and onion skin type periductual fibrosis are typical signatures of liver histopathology in Mdr2−/− mice.10Bile duct injury upon deletion of the phospholipid flippase Mdr2 develops as a consequence of defective biliary phospholipid secretion, which results in a subsequent increase of free non-micellar and therefore potentially toxic bile acid concentrations in bile.9,10The murine Mdr2 gene represents the human orthologue MDR-39,10 and mutations in MDR-3 have been associated with biliary injury.11Interestingly, T effector cells seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of experimental sclerosing cholangitis in Mdr2−/− mice, since expansion of endogenous regulatory T cells have been demonstrated to diminish biliary injury and fibrosis in these animals.12
Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a transcription factor mediating antiviral responses, yet recent evidence indicates that IRF3 also has critical non-transcriptional functions, including activating RIG-I-like receptors-induced IRF-3-mediated pathway of apoptosis (RIPA) and restricting activity of NF-κB. Using a novel murine model expressing only non-transcriptional IRF3 activity (Irf3S1/S1), we tested the hypothesis that non-transcriptional functions of IRF3 modulate innate immune responses in the Gao-binge (acute-on-chronic) model of alcohol-related liver disease. IRF3 and IRF3-mediated signals were analysed in liver samples from 5 patients transplanted for alcoholic hepatitis and 5 healthy controls. C57BL/6, Irf3−/− and Irf3S1/S1 mice were exposed to Gao-binge ethanol-induced liver injury. IRF3-mediated RIPA was investigated in cultured macrophages. Phospho-IRF3 and IRF3-mediated signals were elevated in livers of patients with alcoholic hepatitis. In C57BL/6 mice, Gao-binge ethanol exposure activated IRF3 signaling and resulted in hepatocellular injury. Indicators of liver injury were differentially impacted by Irf3 genotype. Irf3−/−, but not Irf3S1/S1, mice were protected from steatosis, elevated alanine/aspartate aminotransferase levels and inflammatory cytokine expression. In contrast, neutrophil accumulation and endoplasmic reticulum stress were independent of genotype. Protection from Gao-binge injury in Irf3−/− mice was associated with an increased ratio of Ly6Clow (restorative) to Ly6Chigh (inflammatory) cells compared to C57BL/6 and Irf3S1/S1 mice. Reduced ratios of Ly6Clow/Ly6Chigh in C57BL/6 and Irf3S1/S1 mice were associated with increased apoptosis in the Ly6Clow population in response to Gao-binge. Activation of primary macrophage cultures with Poly (I:C) induced translocation of IRF3 to the mitochondria, where it associated with Bax and activated caspases 3 and 9, processes indicative of activation of the RIPA pathway. Taken together, these data identify that the non-transcriptional function of IRF3 plays an important role in modulating the innate immune environment in response to Gao-binge ethanol exposure, via regulation of immune cell apoptosis. Alcohol consumption is a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality worldwide.1The pathogenesis of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is initially characterized by steatosis, progressing in some individuals to fibrosis and cirrhosis.Alcoholic hepatitis (AH), a severe inflammatory condition, with extensive infiltration of leukocytes and hepatocellular injury, can occur at any stage of disease progression; 28-day mortality rates range from 25–35%.1–2The development of AH is a complex process involving both parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells resident in the liver, as well as the recruitment of immune cells to the liver in response to damage and inflammation.3Current therapies, focusing on suppressing inflammation, are ineffective in many patients with severe AH and outcomes remain poor.4

Reduced ratios of Ly6Clow/Ly6Chigh in C57BL/6 and Irf3S1/S1 mice were associated with increased apoptosis in the Ly6Clow population in response to Gao-binge. Activation of primary macrophage cultures with Poly (I:C) induced translocation of IRF3 to the mitochondria, where it associated with Bax and activated caspases 3 and 9, processes indicative of activation of the RIPA pathway. Taken together, these data identify that the non-transcriptional function of IRF3 plays an important role in modulating the innate immune environment in response to Gao-binge ethanol exposure, via regulation of immune cell apoptosis. There is a growing appreciation of a dynamic and complex role of the innate immune system in the progression of ALD, as well as the resolution of hepatocellular injury.Both fluid-phase elements, such as complement,5 and cellular components of the innate immune system contribute to progression and resolution of ethanol-induced liver injury.3This dynamic interplay between injury and repair is mediated, at least in part, by the tremendous plasticity of resident tissue macrophages and infiltrating monocytes; the phenotype of these innate immune cells is rapidly modulated in response to signals within their microenvironment.6Pathogen associated molecular patterns and damage associated molecular patterns are key signals of injury in ALD.3Increased exposure of Kupffer cells, the resident hepatic macrophages, to gut-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) during chronic ethanol7 activates TLR4-dependent production of inflammatory mediators.3In response to these initial inflammatory signals, circulating monocytes and neutrophils infiltrate the liver.3Depending on the stage of injury/repair, infiltrating monocytes can acquire multiple phenotypes, exhibiting pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory and/or pro-resolution/remodeling activity.6

Taken together, these data identify that the non-transcriptional function of IRF3 plays an important role in modulating the innate immune environment in response to Gao-binge ethanol exposure, via regulation of immune cell apoptosis. The precise molecular mechanisms controlling the heterogeneity of innate immune cells in the liver in response to ethanol exposure is not well understood.However, it is likely that regulation of recruitment and phenotypic maturation, as well as maintaining the appropriate balance between pro-survival and pro-death pathways is critical to the ability of innate immune cells to rapidly respond to the demands of maintaining liver homeostasis in the face of ethanol-induced injury.8While there is a good understanding of how ethanol regulates the expression of chemokines and subsequent recruitment of immune cells to the liver,6 the potential mechanisms regulating immune cell death in the liver are particularly understudied.
Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a transcription factor mediating antiviral responses, yet recent evidence indicates that IRF3 also has critical non-transcriptional functions, including activating RIG-I-like receptors-induced IRF-3-mediated pathway of apoptosis (RIPA) and restricting activity of NF-κB. Using a novel murine model expressing only non-transcriptional IRF3 activity (Irf3S1/S1), we tested the hypothesis that non-transcriptional functions of IRF3 modulate innate immune responses in the Gao-binge (acute-on-chronic) model of alcohol-related liver disease. IRF3 and IRF3-mediated signals were analysed in liver samples from 5 patients transplanted for alcoholic hepatitis and 5 healthy controls. C57BL/6, Irf3−/− and Irf3S1/S1 mice were exposed to Gao-binge ethanol-induced liver injury. IRF3-mediated RIPA was investigated in cultured macrophages. Phospho-IRF3 and IRF3-mediated signals were elevated in livers of patients with alcoholic hepatitis. In C57BL/6 mice, Gao-binge ethanol exposure activated IRF3 signaling and resulted in hepatocellular injury. Indicators of liver injury were differentially impacted by Irf3 genotype. Irf3−/−, but not Irf3S1/S1, mice were protected from steatosis, elevated alanine/aspartate aminotransferase levels and inflammatory cytokine expression. In contrast, neutrophil accumulation and endoplasmic reticulum stress were independent of genotype. Protection from Gao-binge injury in Irf3−/− mice was associated with an increased ratio of Ly6Clow (restorative) to Ly6Chigh (inflammatory) cells compared to C57BL/6 and Irf3S1/S1 mice. Reduced ratios of Ly6Clow/Ly6Chigh in C57BL/6 and Irf3S1/S1 mice were associated with increased apoptosis in the Ly6Clow population in response to Gao-binge.

Taken together, these data identify that the non-transcriptional function of IRF3 plays an important role in modulating the innate immune environment in response to Gao-binge ethanol exposure, via regulation of immune cell apoptosis. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is an important regulator of antiviral activity.Upon activation, IRF3 is phosphorylated and pIRF3 acts as a transcription factor essential for the induction of interferon-β (IFNβ) and antiviral genes.Absence of these antiviral functions makes Irf3−/− mice susceptible to a wide range of viral infections.9In addition to its transcriptional functions, IRF3 directly triggers a pro-apoptotic pathway, termed RIG-I-like receptors (RLR)-induced IRF-3-mediated pathway of apoptosis (RIPA) via a non-transcriptional mechanism.10In RIPA, IRF3 is activated by linear ubiquitination on 2 lysine residues, resulting in the interaction of IRF3 with the pro-apoptotic protein Bax.The IRF3/BAX complex then translocates to the mitochondria where it triggers apoptosis.10–11

Recent data suggest that IRF3 plays a critical role in the progression of ALD,12–13 as well as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)14,15 and fibrosis.16However, it is not known if the transcriptional and/or non-transcriptional functions of IRF3 contribute to ethanol-induced liver injury.Since regulated apoptosis is an important mechanism for the resolution of inflammation, we hypothesized that the exacerbated inflammatory responses to AH involve an inappropriate utilization of the IRF3-mediated RIPA pathway.
The extrahepatic bile duct is the primary tissue initially affected by biliary atresia. Biliary atresia is a cholangiopathy which exclusively affects neonates. Current animal models suggest that the developing bile duct is uniquely susceptible to damage. In this study, we aimed to define the anatomical and functional differences between the neonatal and adult mouse extrahepatic bile ducts. We studied mouse passaged cholangiocytes, mouse BALB/c neonatal and adult primary cholangiocytes, as well as isolated extrahepatic bile ducts, and a collagen reporter mouse. The methods used included transmission electron microscopy, lectin staining, immunostaining, rhodamine uptake assays, bile acid toxicity assays, and in vitro modeling of the matrix. The cholangiocyte monolayer of the neonatal extrahepatic bile duct was immature, lacking the uniform apical glycocalyx and mature cell-cell junctions typical of adult cholangiocytes. Functional studies showed that the glycocalyx protected against bile acid injury and that neonatal cholangiocyte monolayers were more permeable than adult monolayers. In adult ducts, the submucosal space was filled with collagen I, elastin, hyaluronic acid, and proteoglycans. In contrast, the neonatal submucosa had little collagen I and elastin, although both increased rapidly after birth. In vitro modeling of the matrix suggested that the composition of the neonatal submucosa relative to the adult submucosa led to increased diffusion of bile. A Col-GFP reporter mouse showed that cells in the neonatal but not adult submucosa were actively producing collagen. We identified 4 key differences between the neonatal and adult extrahepatic bile duct. We showed that these features may have functional implications, suggesting the neonatal extrahepatic bile ducts are particularly susceptible to injury and fibrosis. Mammalian bile travels through an arborizing network, encompassing bile canaliculi, the canals of Hering and ductules, and cholangiocyte-lined intrahepatic (IHBD) and extrahepatic (EHBD) bile ducts.The IHBD and EHBD arise from different primordia: the cranial portion of the endodermal diverticulum gives rise to the liver and the IHBD, while the caudal portion develops into the EHBD.1–3The EHBD and IHBD, in addition to differing in development, size, and surrounding tissue, are also notable for differential susceptibility to certain cholangiopathies including primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and the neonatal fibro-obliterative disease biliary atresia (BA).BA, which at the time of presentation primarily affects the EHBD, is specific to neonates, who are born apparently healthy but progress remarkably quickly (within several months) to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.Recent human and animal model data suggest that the initial insult is prenatal, affecting the neonate but sparing the mother.4–8This suggests a paradigm whereby the fetal and neonatal ducts, especially the EHBD, are uniquely susceptible to initial and progressive damage from injurious agents.

We showed that these features may have functional implications, suggesting the neonatal extrahepatic bile ducts are particularly susceptible to injury and fibrosis. Bile ducts have specialized anatomical features that protect them from bile acid-mediated injury and other insults.Specialized protective features of cholangiocytes include unique apical membranes and an apical glycocalyx with a protective “bicarbonate umbrella” layer.9–11The EHBD submucosa may also have a protective function.It has recently been described to comprise a fluid-containing interstitial space with a lattice of collagen bundles, elastin, and thin fibroblast-like cells directly adherent to the collagen bundles.12These features serve a barrier function, provide structural support to the duct, and also likely serve as a shock absorber and a conduit for the movement of soluble and cellular factors.12
Treatment programs for people who inject drugs (PWID), including prisoners, are important for achieving hepatitis C elimination targets. There are multiple barriers to treatment of hepatitis C in prisons, including access to specialist physicians, testing and antiviral therapy, short prison sentences, and frequent inter-prison transfer. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a nurse-led model of care for the treatment of prisoners with hepatitis C. A statewide program for assessment and management of hepatitis C was developed in Victoria, Australia to improve access to care for prisoners. This nurse-led model of care is supported by telemedicine to provide decentralized care within all prisons in the state. We prospectively evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of this nurse-led model of care for hepatitis C within the 14 adult prisons over a 13-month period. The primary endpoint was sustained virological response at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12) using per protocol analysis. There were 416 prisoners included in the analysis. The median age was 41 years, 90% were male, 50% had genotype 3 and 44% genotype 1 hepatitis C and 21% had cirrhosis. Injecting drug use was reported by 68% in the month prior to prison entry, 54% were receiving opioid substitution therapy, and 86% reported never previously engaging with specialist HCV care. Treatment duration was 8 weeks in 24%, 12 weeks in 59%, and 24 weeks in 17% of treatment courses. The SVR12 rate was 96% (301/313) per protocol. Inter-prison transfer occurred during 26% of treatment courses but was not associated with lower SVR12 rates. No treatment-related serious adverse events occurred. Hepatitis C treatment using a decentralized, nurse-led model of care is highly effective and can reach large numbers of prisoners. Large scale prison treatment programs should be considered to support hepatitis C elimination efforts. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set global targets for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat.1For hepatitis C, the goals are to reduce incidence by 80% and mortality by 65% by 2030.In Western countries where injecting drug use is the dominant risk factor for hepatitis C transmission,2 eliminating incident infection will require coordinated efforts using harm reduction strategies as well as “treatment as prevention” to interrupt transmission among people who inject drugs (PWID).This population has not typically been well engaged with specialist care, highlighting the need to develop new models of care for hepatitis C among marginalized, high transmitting populations.

Hepatitis C treatment using a decentralized, nurse-led model of care is highly effective and can reach large numbers of prisoners. Large scale prison treatment programs should be considered to support hepatitis C elimination efforts. Prison systems provide a unique opportunity to scale-up hepatitis C treatment.3The prevalence of hepatitis C is higher in prisoners than in the general population, reflecting the criminalization of drug use and the frequent detention of PWIDs.4,5In Australia, 46% of prisoners self-report a lifetime history of injecting drug use, and the hepatitis C seroprevalence among incarcerated PWID is greater than 50%.6Harm reduction strategies currently available in Australian prisons include bleach for cleansing of injection devices and opioid substitution therapy (OST).Despite this, ongoing incident hepatitis C infection has been reported among PWID in Australian prisons.7The median sentence length in Australia is less than 6 months and there are high rates of recidivism, meaning that prisoners frequently cycle between incarceration and freedom, creating new networks for hepatitis C transmission.8Mathematical modelling studies have demonstrated that the global elimination of HCV will require widespread treatment of key risk populations, in particular PWID.9,10Treatment programs in prisons, where a large numbers of PWID can be screened and treated, could therefore significantly contribute to the HCV elimination agenda.9

Hepatitis C treatment using a decentralized, nurse-led model of care is highly effective and can reach large numbers of prisoners. Large scale prison treatment programs should be considered to support hepatitis C elimination efforts. Despite WHO recommending universal screening of all prisoners for hepatitis C,3 rates remain low in many regions worldwide and treatment programs have been limited by multiple barriers.11–14Historical barriers have included the nature of interferon-based therapy (parenteral, long duration, significant toxicity and poor efficacy) as well as systemic barriers (limited local access to clinicians, need for hospital-based specialist review, frequent transfer between prisons interrupting care, and budgetary policy requiring that funding for testing and treatment come from local prison budgets rather than national health schemes).The recent introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for the treatment of hepatitis C has provided highly effective therapy that is simple and safe, with short treatment durations – ideal for the prison environment.However, DAAs are expensive, which has limited the implementation of prison treatment programs worldwide;15 less than 20% of surveyed European countries provided access to hepatitis C treatment in all prisons.14Where treatment is available to people in custody, it has often been restricted to prisoners with advanced liver disease.16,17Such a policy will withhold effective treatment from most people living with hepatitis C in prison, including those at risk of transmission.
The microenvironment regulates hepatoma stem cell behavior. However, the contributions of lymphatic endothelial cells to the hepatoma stem cell niche remain largely unknown; we aimed to analyze this contribution and elucidate the mechanisms behind it. Associations between lymphatic endothelial cells and CD133+ hepatoma stem cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence and adhesion assays; with the effects of their association on IL-17A expression examined using western blot, quantitative reverse transcription PCR and luciferase reporter assay. The effects of IL-17A on the self-renewal and tumorigenesis of hepatoma stem cells were examined using sphere and tumor formation assays. The role of IL-17A in immune escape by hepatoma stem cells was examined using flow cytometry. The expression of IL-17A in hepatoma tissues was examined using immunohistochemistry. CD133+ hepatoma stem cells preferentially interact with lymphatic endothelial cells. The interaction between the mannose receptor and high-mannose type N-glycans mediates the interaction between CD133+ hepatoma stem cells and lymphatic endothelial cells. This interaction activates cytokine IL-17A expression in lymphatic endothelial cells. IL-17A promotes the self-renewal of hepatoma stem cells. It also promotes their immune escape, partly through upregulation of PD-L1. Interactions between lymphatic endothelial cells and hepatoma stem cells promote the self-renewal and immune escape of hepatoma stem cells, by activating IL-17A signaling. Thus, inhibiting IL-17A signaling may be a promising approach for hepatoma treatment. Hepatoma stem cells are thought to be responsible for the initial development, progression and therapeutic resistance of hepatomas.1For example, CD133+ hepatoma cells highly express stemness genes, possess multi-lineage differentiation capabilities and are highly tumorigenic in immunocompromised mice.2,3Exploring the mechanisms behind the highly tumorigenic nature of hepatoma stem cells will contribute to the development of therapeutic approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma.

Thus, inhibiting IL-17A signaling may be a promising approach for hepatoma treatment. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) exist in a cellular niche comprised of numerous cell types.4,5For example, tumor-associated macrophages promote the survival and self-renewal of CSCs.6Lymphatic vessels are one of the major routes by which cancer cells disseminate.7Increasing evidence has shown that lymphatic endothelial cells regulate tumor cell behaviors.For example, lymphatic endothelial cells recruit CXCR4- or CCR7-expressing cancer cells by chemo-attraction.8In addition, lymphatic endothelial cells secrete factors to support tumor cell proliferation.9Thus, lymphatic endothelial cell serves as an important component of the tumor microenvironment.However, the mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between CSCs and lymphatic endothelial cells remain largely unknown.
Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major complication of hemorrhagic shock, liver resection and transplantation. YAP, a key downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, is essential for determining cell fate and maintaining homeostasis in the liver. We aimed to elucidate its role in IRI. The role of YAP/Hippo signaling was systematically studied in biopsy specimens from 60 patients after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), and in a mouse model of liver warm IRI. Human biopsy specimens were collected after 2–10 h of cold storage and 3 h post-reperfusion, before being screened by western blot. In the mouse model, the role of YAP was probed by activating or inhibiting YAP prior to ischemia-reperfusion. In human biopsies, high post-OLT YAP expression was correlated with well-preserved histology and improved hepatocellular function at postoperative day 1–7. In mice, the ischemia insult (90 min) triggered intrinsic hepatic YAP expression, which peaked at 1–6 h of reperfusion. Activation of YAP protected the liver against IR-stress, by promoting regenerative and anti-oxidative gene induction, while diminishing oxidative stress, necrosis/apoptosis and the innate inflammatory response. Inhibition of YAP aggravated hepatic IRI and suppressed repair/anti-oxidative genes. In mouse hepatocyte cultures, activating YAP prevented hypoxia-reoxygenation induced stress. Interestingly, YAP activation suppressed extracellular matrix synthesis and diminished hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, whereas YAP inhibition significantly delayed hepatic repair, potentiated HSC activation, and enhanced liver fibrosis at 7 days post-IRI. Notably, YAP activation failed to protect Nrf2-deficient livers against IR-mediated damage, leading to extensive fibrosis. Our novel findings document the crucial role of YAP in IR-mediated hepatocellular damage and liver fibrogenesis, providing evidence of a potential therapeutic target for the management of sterile liver inflammation in transplant recipients. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is considered the standard treatment for end-stage liver disease.Following organ retrieval, cold preservation and warm ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) can lead to impaired graft function, including primary graft non-function, which may predispose patients to acute and chronic rejection.Indeed, by contributing to a shortage of available donor organs, IRI represents one of the most challenging problems in transplantation.1–4Thus, novel therapeutic concepts to combat IRI are needed to improve OLT outcomes and expand the donor organ pool.

Hepatic IRI, initiated by hypoxic stress, is an exogenous antigen-independent local inflammatory response.IR-insulted hepatocytes then produce damage-associated molecular patterns, which trigger innate immune responses and inflammation.3Hepatocellular death is mainly characterized by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced hepatocellular necrosis and innate pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated apoptosis in liver IRI.2

Liver fibrosis is a highly conserved and coordinated protective response to tissue injury, which disrupts the normal liver architecture, and causes hepatocellular dysfunction and portal hypertension.5–8Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are considered the major source of liver myofibroblasts.9–11The interaction between macrophage-mediated innate immunity and HSC activation/proliferation is essential in liver fibrogenesis.12–14Prolonged ischemia time was considered one of the most important risk factors related to post-transplant hepatic fibrosis in pediatric liver transplantation.7However, the mechanism of IR-mediated fibrosis/cirrhosis and chronic graft non-function remains to be determined.

The Hippo pathway and its downstream effector YAP (Yes-associated protein) control organ size in animals through the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis.15,16Hippo signaling sequesters YAP to the cytoplasm via phospho-specific and cell-tension based mechanisms.17YAP primarily binds to the TEAD family of transcription factors to activate target gene expression.17In the mammalian liver, YAP determines cell fate and maintains homeostasis.18Its high-to-low gradient expression from the portal vein area to the central vein contributes to the heterogeneity of hepatocytes and liver zonation.19,20Loss of YAP in the liver leads to defects in both hepatocyte survival and biliary epithelial cell development,21 whereas its ectopic activation results in hepatocyte dedifferentiation and hepatomegaly, and may promote carcinogenesis.15,16,22After hepatectomy, YAP activation was also found to be essential for liver repair and regeneration.23,24
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder causing pulmonary and liver disease. The PiZ mutation in AAT (SERPINA1) results in mis-folded AAT protein (Z-AAT) accumulating in hepatocytes, leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis. RNAi-based therapeutics silencing production of hepatic Z-AAT might benefit patients with AATD-associated liver disease. This study evaluated an RNAi therapeutic to silence production of AAT. Part A of this double-blind first-in-human study randomized 54 healthy volunteers (HVs) into single dose cohorts (two placebo: four active), receiving escalating doses of the investigational agent ARC-AAT from 0.38 to 8.0 mg/kg or placebo. Part B randomized 11 patients with PiZZ (homozygous for Z-AAT) genotype AATD, who received up to 4.0 mg/kg of ARC-AAT or placebo. Patients with baseline FibroScan® >11 kPa or forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) <60% were excluded. Assessments included safety, pharmacokinetics, and change in serum AAT concentrations. A total of 36 HVs received ARC-AAT and 18 received placebo (part A). Seven PiZZ individuals received ARC-AAT and four received placebo (part B). A dose response in serum AAT reduction was observed at doses ≥4 mg/kg with similar relative reductions in PiZZ patients and HVs at 4 mg/kg and a maximum reduction of 76.1% (HVs) vs. 78.8% (PiZZ) at this dose. The time it took for serum AAT to return to baseline was similar for HV and PiZZ. There were no notable differences between HV and PiZZ safety parameters. The study was terminated early because of toxicity findings related to the delivery vehicle (ARC-EX1) seen in a non-human primate study. PiZZ patients and HVs responded similarly to ARC-AAT. Deep and durable knockdown of hepatic AAT production based on observed reduction in serum AAT concentrations was demonstrated. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an autosomal co-dominant disease which predisposes patients to early-onset emphysema and liver cirrhosis.1Estimates of the number of adult patients with AATD exhibiting clinically significant liver disease have varied from 10% (defined by aminotransferase abnormalities)2,3 to 18% in a UK cohort assessed by ultrasound (+/− biopsy)4 to approximately 35% in those with an Ishak fibrosis score ≥2 assessed histologically after liver biopsy.5A Swedish autopsy series from patients with AATD and the PiZZ genotype found liver disease to be present in the majority of patients, albeit unrecognized in many cases during life.6In common with other causes of cirrhosis, many factors are thought to affect clinical presentation, including alcohol use,7 body mass index,8 gender9 and genetic modifiers.Liver disease shows a bimodal clinical presentation.Prolonged neonatal jaundice is common in newborns with the PiZZ genotype, with most recovering but others progressing to cirrhotic disease that requires transplantation at a young age.10,11A second peak occurs in adults who can present with clinical liver disease that can also progress to cirrhosis and transplant, even in the absence of a childhood history of liver disease.3No definitive methods to predict progression to cirrhosis exist at present in either the pediatric or adult populations.Current management of liver disease in AATD is largely supportive, with transplantation the only definitive treatment.In the U.S., AATD accounts for approximately 1.5% of liver transplants with ∼76 transplants performed annually12 with outcomes similar to other common indications for transplant.13
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is one the most potent nucleot(s)ide analogues for treating chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Phenotypic resistance caused by genotypic resistance to TDF has not been reported. This study aimed to characterize HBV mutations that confer tenofovir resistance. Two patients with viral breakthrough during treatment with TDF-containing regimens were prospectively enrolled. The gene encoding HBV reverse transcriptase was sequenced. Eleven HBV clones harboring a series of mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. Drug susceptibility of each clone was determined by Southern blot analysis and real-time PCR. The relative frequency of mutants was evaluated by ultra-deep sequencing and clonal analysis. Five mutations (rtS106C [C], rtH126Y [Y], rtD134E [E], rtM204I/V, and rtL269I [I]) were commonly found in viral isolates from 2 patients. The novel mutations C, Y, and E were associated with drug resistance. In assays for drug susceptibility, the IC50 value for wild-type HBV was 3.8 ± 0.6 µM, whereas the IC50 values for CYE and CYEI mutants were 14.1 ± 1.8 and 58.1 ± 0.9 µM, respectively. The IC90 value for wild-type HBV was 30 ± 0.5 µM, whereas the IC90 values for CYE and CYEI mutants were 185 ± 0.5 and 790 ± 0.2 µM, respectively. Both tenofovir-resistant mutants and wild-type HBV had similar susceptibility to the capsid assembly modulator NVR 3–778 (IC50 <0.4 µM vs. IC50 = 0.4 µM, respectively). Our study reveals that the quadruple (CYEI) mutation increases the amount of tenofovir required to inhibit HBV by 15.3-fold in IC50 and 26.3-fold in IC90. These results demonstrate that tenofovir-resistant HBV mutants can emerge, although the genetic barrier is high. Worldwide, an estimated 2 billion people are infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and 686,000 people die from complications due to HBV each year.1Despite the development of nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) drugs, antiviral therapy of HBV infection remains a major clinical issue.Due to both the viral persistence and heterogeneity of the HBV genome, the emergence of drug-resistant mutants is inevitable.The development of drug resistance is associated with poor prognosis.Problems arising from drug resistance include hepatitis flares, reversion of histologic improvement, and sometimes severe exacerbation of illness, hepatic decompensation, or death.2

Both entecavir and tenofovir (which is an active moiety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF] or tenofovir alafenamide [TAF]) are approved as first-line therapeutic options for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in current international guidelines due to their high potency and low resistance of the virus.3,4Although entecavir has a high genetic barrier to resistance, resistance to entecavir has been reported with a significant incidence rate, especially in patients with genotypic resistance to lamivudine and a prior history of lamivudine treatment.5,6

These results demonstrate that tenofovir-resistant HBV mutants can emerge, although the genetic barrier is high. Meanwhile, HBV that displays clinical resistance to tenofovir has not been reported.Although TDF showed inferior efficacy in adefovir-experienced patients,7 there was no detectable genotypic resistance to TDF after 8 years of therapy in patients with CHB.8Although the rtA194T mutation was reported to decrease tenofovir sensitivity by increasing the IC50 value in in vitro analysis, it does not confer tenofovir resistance in vivo nor is it associated with partial tenofovir drug resistance.9–11A recent article reported that rtS78T/sC69* was related to tenofovir resistance, but the IC50 values were increased by only 1.6-fold compared to wild-type.12Moreover, a recent randomized control study reported that viral response to TDF monotherapy was comparable to that to TDF and entecavir combination therapy in patients with multidrug resistance (MDR).13,14However, daily clinical practice shows that there are patients with a partial response to TDF varying from 0.8% to 24% and some patients developed viral breakthrough despite good adherence to TDF.15,16Therefore, we suspected the existence of genotypic resistance to tenofovir.
Non-invasive tools for monitoring treatment response and disease progression in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are needed. Our objective was to evaluate the utility of magnetic resonance (MR)-based hepatic imaging measures for the assessment of liver histology in patients with NASH. We analyzed data from patients with NASH and stage 2 or 3 fibrosis enrolled in a phase II study of selonsertib. Pre- and post-treatment assessments included centrally read MR elastography (MRE)-estimated liver stiffness, MR imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF), and liver biopsies evaluated according to the NASH Clinical Research Network classification and the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS). Among 54 patients with MRE and biopsies at baseline and week 24, 18 (33%) had fibrosis improvement (≥1-stage reduction) after undergoing 24 weeks of treatment with the study drug. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of MRE-stiffness to predict fibrosis improvement was 0.62 (95% CI 0.46–0.78) and the optimal threshold was a ≥0% relative reduction. At this threshold, MRE had 67% sensitivity, 64% specificity, 48% positive predictive value, 79% negative predictive value. Among 65 patients with MRI-PDFF and biopsies at baseline and week 24, a ≥1-grade reduction in steatosis was observed in 18 (28%). The AUROC of MRI-PDFF to predict steatosis response was 0.70 (95% CI 0.57–0.83) and the optimal threshold was a ≥0% relative reduction. At this threshold, MRI-PDFF had 89% sensitivity and 47% specificity, 39% positive predictive value, and 92% negative predictive value. These preliminary data support the further evaluation of MRE-stiffness and MRI-PDFF for the longitudinal assessment of histologic response in patients with NASH. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) characterized by the presence of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning with or without fibrosis.1Patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis are at greatest risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality.2–5The global prevalence of NASH is between 1.5% and 6.5%.6Widespread screening is not currently feasible given that a definitive diagnosis of NASH can only be made through identification of the characteristic histopathologic pattern on liver biopsy.7While liver biopsy remains the gold standard, its disadvantages are well known.It is an invasive procedure that can lead to serious complications, including hospitalization for pain, bleeding, and, in rare cases, death.8,9Few patients are willing to undergo repeat biopsies necessary to monitor disease progression and to evaluate treatment response in trials of experimental therapeutic agents.Moreover, the interpretation of biopsy results is subject to variability due in part to inter- and intra-observer differences; the risk of sampling error is high due to the patchy nature of the histopathologic lesions in NASH; and biopsy is not able to discriminate intermediate stages of fibrosis.10–13There is a pressing unmet medical need for reliable and accurate non-invasive tools to evaluate steatosis and fibrosis in patients with NASH, and to monitor response to treatment.

These preliminary data support the further evaluation of MRE-stiffness and MRI-PDFF for the longitudinal assessment of histologic response in patients with NASH. Two magnetic resonance-based imaging technologies have shown promise as non-invasive assessments of patients with NASH.Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is a quantitative imaging biomarker of liver stiffness which is based on an analysis of shear waves induced in the liver by low-frequency vibrations applied to the abdominal wall.In cross-sectional studies, MRE has demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for discriminating fibrosis stage and predicting clinical complications.14–17However, the correlation between change in MRE-estimated liver stiffness with histologic response is unknown, and a clinically relevant threshold for MRE-estimated liver stiffness reduction for predicting an anti-fibrotic response has not been identified.

These preliminary data support the further evaluation of MRE-stiffness and MRI-PDFF for the longitudinal assessment of histologic response in patients with NASH. Magnetic resonance imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) is a quantitative imaging biomarker of hepatic steatosis.MRI-PDFF has been shown to be accurate compared to PDFF measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy in cross-sectional studies18,19 and to histologic steatosis grade determined from liver biopsy in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies,20,21 and has been used in drug treatment clinical trials to assess longitudinal changes in hepatic steatosis in patients with NASH.20,22,23In a meta-analysis of 23 studies with 1,679 participants, MRI-PDFF was shown to have excellent linearity, bias, and precision across different reconstruction methods, and MR scanners of different field strength and manufacturer.24A reduction of approximately 30% in MRI-PDFF has been associated with steatosis improvement.25It is important to note that histologic assessment of hepatic steatosis estimates the number of steatotic cells in the liver, while MRI-PDFF estimates the overall percentage of MRI-visible protons on fat molecules in the liver.21Since the fat content of a cell does not generally exceed 50%, MRI-PDFF percentages are almost always less than half the value derived by histology.For example, if 100% of hepatocytes on hematoxylin and eosin stain were 50% filled with fat globules, the steatosis percentage would be 100% by histologic assessment, but only 50% by MRI-PDFF.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in adults and children. Along with obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance, genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile acid metabolism and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with liver damage in NAFLD remains to be defined. We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on liver damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of the KLB mutant. The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with an increased risk of ballooning and lobular inflammation. KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free fatty acids caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB downregulation obtained by the expression of a KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular lipid accumulation and upregulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression. In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that the KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the leading cause of liver damage worldwide.1The histologic spectrum of NAFLD ranges from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and eventually progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).2,3NAFLD is a multifactorial disease where environmental factors, such as an excessive caloric intake and a sedentary lifestyle, and genetic factors interact with each other, triggering the metabolic and hepatic events that lead to liver fat accumulation and progressive liver disease.4In recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified inherited variants in genes involved in hepatic fat uptake, synthesis, storage and mobilization of triglycerides which have been associated with a higher risk of NAFLD in adults.5–7Most of these genetic variants, such as the rs738409 C>G in patatin-like phospholipase domain–containing 3 (PNPLA3) gene and the rs58542926 C>T in transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2) gene, also increase the risk of NAFLD in pediatric patients.8–10Due to their effect size these polymorphisms explain the genetic susceptibility to NAFLD development and progression in most individuals.11However, other genetic variants may contribute to determine the motley pattern of histologic features associated with NAFLD and to explain the missing heritability.12

NAFLD development and progression are complex to decipher, and the most innovative pathogenic concept that has been proposed involves the crosstalk between the liver, gut and adipose tissue.13Recent experimental and clinical evidence has suggested that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 15/19 and its receptor system represent one of the most important gut-derived signals, which impacts on adipose tissue and liver response during diet-induced NAFLD.14,15

We can speculate that the KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes. FGF19/FGF15 (FGF15 is the mouse orthologue of the human FGF19) belongs to the FGF19 subfamily, together with FGF21 and FGF23.These factors have no affinity for heparan sulfates and are able to freely diffuse from their tissue of origin into the blood circulation.For these reasons, they can act as hormones.In particular, FGF19 regulates bile acid (BA) homeostasis and gallbladder filling/emptying.16–18BAs are molecules synthesized in the liver and stored in the gallbladder, essential for solubilization of fatty acids, for digestion and lipid absorption in the small intestine.19Liver-derived BA bind to farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in enterocytes thus inducing the expression of FGF19, which is released into the portal circulation.FGF19 is transported to the liver and interacts with fibroblast growth factor receptor-4 (FGFR4) assisted by the β-Klotho (KLB) co-receptor, which is crucial for full activation of the FGF/FGFR complex and for the induction of the intracellular responses, such as downregulation of cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and consequent inhibition of BA synthesis.20–23

We previously reported an inverse association between FGF19 plasma levels, hepatic Klotho expression and severity of liver damage in a cohort of obese pediatric patients with NAFLD.24These previous data suggested that the decrease of hepatic Klotho protein in pediatric NAFLD could be ascribable to the beta isoform (KLB), which is the main form in the liver.25–28
Whether non-selective beta blockers (NSBBs) are deleterious in patients with end-stage cirrhosis and refractory ascites has been widely debated. We hypothesized that only the subset of patients on the liver transplant waiting list who had impaired cardiac performance would be at increased risk of mortality if receiving NSBBs. This study included 584 consecutive patients with cirrhosis evaluated for transplantation between 1999 and 2014. All patients had right heart catheterization with hemodynamic measurements at evaluation. Fifty percent received NSBBs. Refractory ascites was present in 33%. Cardiac performance was assessed by left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI). Waiting list mortality without liver transplantation was explored using competing risk analysis. LVSWI was significantly lower in patients with refractory ascites. In multivariate analysis using competing risk, refractory ascites, NSBBs and LVSWI were associated with waiting list mortality in the whole population, with a statistically significant interaction between NSBBs and LVSWI. The most discriminant value of LVSWI was 64.1 g-m/m2. In the final model, refractory ascites (subdistribution hazard ratio 1.52; 95% CI 1.01–2.28; p = 0.0083) and treatment by NSBBs with LVSWI <64.1 g-m/m2 (subdistribution hazard ratio 1.96; 95% CI 1.32–2.90; p = 0.0009) were significantly associated with waiting list mortality, taking into account serum sodium and the model for end-stage liver disease score. This study suggests that compromised cardiac performance is more common in patients with refractory ascites and that NSBBs are deleterious in cirrhotic patients with compromised cardiac performance. These results highlight the prognostic value of cardiac function in patients with end-stage cirrhosis. Complex interactions between splanchnic and systemic hemodynamic changes are characteristic features of advanced cirrhosis.1Splanchnic and systemic vasodilation associated with decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and increased cardiac output (CO) result in a hyperkinetic state.2–4However, the imbalance between systemic and splanchnic circulation is associated with a state of effective hypovolemia.Besides hyperkinetic state and effective hypovolemia, so-called cirrhotic cardiomyopathy was described several years ago.5,6Typically, cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is characterized by (i) a blunted contractile responsiveness to stress, (ii) diastolic dysfunction and (iii) electromechanical abnormalities,5,7 in the absence of other known causes of heart disease.Such cardiac changes may be present in up to 60% of patients with cirrhosis, especially in those with ascites.8However, the prevalence of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy has not been extensively investigated.In addition, some series suggest that cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is not related to the severity of cirrhosis,9 while others suggest a correlation between cardiac changes and disease severity.10,11Moreover, the impact of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy on the outcome of patients with advanced cirrhosis and on post-transplant survival is poorly understood.11–15

This study suggests that compromised cardiac performance is more common in patients with refractory ascites and that NSBBs are deleterious in cirrhotic patients with compromised cardiac performance. These results highlight the prognostic value of cardiac function in patients with end-stage cirrhosis. Non-selective beta blockers (NSBBs) are routinely used in cirrhotic patients to prevent variceal bleeding.16,17However, it has been suggested that NSBBs could be deleterious in patients with refractory ascites with a significant increase in mortality risk.18However, the deleterious impact of NSBBs in patients with advanced cirrhosis remains a controversial issue.Indeed, several studies did not find any association between NSBBs and increased mortality in patients with ascites while, in some series, outcome was found to be better in patients receiving NSBBs, suggesting that only a subset of these patients could be at risk.19–22
Whether non-selective beta blockers (NSBBs) are deleterious in patients with end-stage cirrhosis and refractory ascites has been widely debated. We hypothesized that only the subset of patients on the liver transplant waiting list who had impaired cardiac performance would be at increased risk of mortality if receiving NSBBs. This study included 584 consecutive patients with cirrhosis evaluated for transplantation between 1999 and 2014. All patients had right heart catheterization with hemodynamic measurements at evaluation. Fifty percent received NSBBs. Refractory ascites was present in 33%. Cardiac performance was assessed by left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI). Waiting list mortality without liver transplantation was explored using competing risk analysis. LVSWI was significantly lower in patients with refractory ascites. In multivariate analysis using competing risk, refractory ascites, NSBBs and LVSWI were associated with waiting list mortality in the whole population, with a statistically significant interaction between NSBBs and LVSWI. The most discriminant value of LVSWI was 64.1 g-m/m2. In the final model, refractory ascites (subdistribution hazard ratio 1.52; 95% CI 1.01–2.28; p = 0.0083) and treatment by NSBBs with LVSWI <64.1 g-m/m2 (subdistribution hazard ratio 1.96; 95% CI 1.32–2.90; p = 0.0009) were significantly associated with waiting list mortality, taking into account serum sodium and the model for end-stage liver disease score. This study suggests that compromised cardiac performance is more common in patients with refractory ascites and that NSBBs are deleterious in cirrhotic patients with compromised cardiac performance. These results highlight the prognostic value of cardiac function in patients with end-stage cirrhosis. Evaluation of cardiac function is typically based on echocardiography which enables the measurement of ventricular wall thickness and systolic ejection fraction.However, diastolic function is also crucial in myocardial performance.23In routine clinical practice, evaluation of diastolic function is also based on Doppler echocardiography with measurement of E/A ratio, (namely, the ratio of flow velocities of the left ventricle inflow during the rapid passive filling [E wave] and during atrial contraction [A wave]).24However, interpretation of E/A ratio may be misleading in cirrhosis.25Firstly, E/A ratio decreases in any condition of central hypovolemia, a common state in decompensated cirrhosis.In addition, E/A decreases with age and tends to become <1 in patients over 60 years-old due to the physiological slowing of relaxation.26The use of tissue Doppler imaging echocardiography is also limited by the same confounding factors in cirrhosis.27

These results highlight the prognostic value of cardiac function in patients with end-stage cirrhosis. Recently, the concept of global assessment of heart function, rather than systolic on the one hand and diastolic on the other hand has reemerged.28Global cardiac performance can be assessed by a variable termed left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) which reflects the amount of energy available to maintain perfusion of the vital organs.29,30LVSWI considers not only cardiac output but also arterial pressure, a major determinant in the efficacy of circulation.Decreased LVSWI has been associated with worse outcome in patients with heart failure.30Overall, LVSWI is another marker of global heart function, requiring invasive hemodynamic measurements,31 which has not yet been extensively investigated in cirrhosis.A recent study conducted in patients with cirrhosis has shown that LVSWI is progressively impaired as disease severity progresses, in both relatively hypodynamic (cardiac index <3.2 L/min/m2) and hyperdynamic states (cardiac index >4.2 L/min/m2).32
Intrahepatic (ICC) and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) have rarely been studied individually, probably due to difficulties in their diagnosis and certification. Mortality trends from these 2 neoplasms have been inconsistent over the last decades. The aim of this study was to analyze worldwide trends in mortality from ICC and ECC in selected countries. We extracted death certification data for ICC and ECC, and population estimates from the World Health Organization and Pan American Health Organization databases for 32 selected countries from Europe, the Americas, and Australasia from 1995 to 2016. We computed age-standardized (world population) mortality rates from ICC and ECC, and performed joinpoint regression analysis. Mortality rates from ICC increased in all countries considered, with a levelling off over recent years in Germany (women), Italy (men), Argentina (men), the USA (men), Hong Kong (men), and Japan (both sexes). The highest rates in 2010–2014 (1.5–2.5/100,000 in men and 1.2–1.7/100,000 in women) were registered in Hong Kong, France, Austria, Spain, the UK, and Australia. The lowest rates (0.2–0.6/100,000 in both sexes) were registered in Latin American and eastern European countries. Mortality from ECC decreased in most of the countries considered, with rates below 1/100,000 in both sexes between 2010 and 2014, with the only exception being Japan (2.8/100,000 in men and 1.4/100,000 in women). Increasing mortality from ICC was observed globally, due to trends in risk factors and possibly, in part, due to better disease classification. Mortality from ECC levelled off or decreased, most likely following the increased use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Cholangiocarcinoma is the second most common primary liver neoplasm after hepatocellular carcinoma.1,2These neoplasms arise from the epithelial cells of the biliary tree, commonly classified as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) if they arise above the hilar junction of bile ducts or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) if they arise within or below the hilum.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, the cellular defense mechanisms underlying ALD are not well understood. Recent studies highlighted the involvement of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism. Sorting nexin (SNX)-10 has a regulatory function in endolysosomal trafficking and stabilisation. Here, we investigated the roles of SNX10 in CMA activation and in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis. Snx10 knockout (Snx10 KO) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates fed either the Lieber–DeCarli liquid alcohol diet or a control liquid diet, and primary cultured WT and Snx10 KO hepatocytes stimulated with ethanol, were used as in vivo and in vitro ALD models, respectively. Activation of CMA, liver injury parameters, inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and lipid metabolism were measured. Compared with WT littermates, Snx10 KO mice exhibited a significant amelioration in ethanol-induced liver injury and hepatic steatosis. Both in vivo and in vitro studies showed that SNX10 deficiency upregulated lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A) expression and CMA activation, which could be reversed by SNX10 overexpression in vitro. LAMP-2A interference confirmed that the upregulation of Nrf2 and AMPK signalling pathways induced by SNX10 deficiency relied on CMA activation. Pull-down assays revealed an interaction between SNX10 and cathepsin A (CTSA), a key enzyme involved in LAMP-2A degradation. Deficiency in SNX10 inhibited CTSA maturation and increased the stability of LAMP-2A, resulting in an increase in CMA activity. SNX10 controls CMA activity by mediating CTSA maturation, and, thus, has an essential role in alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis. Our results provide evidence for SNX10 as a potential promising therapeutic target for preventing or ameliorating liver injury in ALD. Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a spectrum of disorders ranging from reversible steatosis to life-threatening and irreversible cirrhosis, and, in some patients, hepatocellular cancer.1Alcohol exposure induces oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which lead to hepatocyte apoptosis, necrosis, and necroptosis, as well as hepatic inflammation.In addition, ethanol consumption disrupts lipid metabolism and subsequently results in the accumulation of excessive triglycerides in the liver, further aggravating liver injury.2Even though much research has focussed on understanding the pathological features of ALD, the cellular mechanisms that defend against the detrimental effects of alcohol remain unclear.Although therapeutic strategies, including alcohol abstinence, corticosteroids, biologics such as anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and liver transplantation have been used, these might not be always either practical or sufficient.3,4Thus, there is an urgent need to develop specific therapies for ALD.

Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a type of autophagy involved in the degradation of cytosolic proteins with a specific pentapeptide motif.After being recognised and bound by HSC70, a constitutive cytosolic chaperone, these proteins are translocated to lysosomes for uptake by lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A) and depredation in lysosomes.5CMA can be maximally activated under stress situations to ensure the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.Dysfunction of CMA has been implicated in several human disorders resulting from failure to remove damaged proteins caused by insults such as oxidative stress, hypoxia, or proteotoxicity.6–9Growing evidence highlights the involvement of CMA in regulating hepatic lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and suggests that dysfunction of CMA has a major role in hepatic metabolic dysregulation.10,11Thus, there is a need to determine whether CMA activation can contribute to relieving ethanol-induced liver injury and abnormal hepatic lipid metabolism.
In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatocytes can undergo necroptosis, a regulated form of necrotic cell death mediated by the receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 1. We herein assessed the potential of RIPK1 and its downstream effector mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), as therapeutic targets and markers of activity in NAFLD. C57/BL6J-mice were fed a normal chow diet (NCD) or high fat diet (HFD). The effect of RIPA-56, a highly specific inhibitor of RIPK1, was evaluated in either a prophylactic or a curative treatment of HFD-fed mice, and in primary human steatotic hepatocytes. RIPK1 and MLKL concentrations were measured in the serum of patients with NAFLD. Both prophylactic and curative treatments of HFD-fed mice with RIPA-56, caused a down-regulation of MLKL and a reduction of liver injury, inflammation and fibrosis, characteristic of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), as well as of steatosis. This latter effect was reproduced by treating primary human steatotic hepatocytes with RIPA-56 or necrosulfonamide (NSA), a specific inhibitor of human MLKL, and by knocking out (KO) MLKL in fat-loaded AML-12 mouse hepatocytes. MLKL KO in steatotic hepatocytes, caused an activation of the mitochondrial respiration, and an increase in β-oxidation. Along with MLKL decreased activation, RIPK3-KO mice exhibited increased activities of the liver mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in experimental NASH. In patients with NAFLD, serum concentrations of RIPK1 and MLKL increased in correlation with the activity. The inhibition of RIPK1 improves NASH features in HFD-fed mice and reverses steatosis by an MLKL-dependent mechanism that involves at least partly an increase in mitochondrial respiration. RIPK1 and MLKL are potential serum markers of activity and promising therapeutic targets in NAFLD. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been paralleling the worldwide increase in obesity for the last decades.It has become the most common chronic liver disease, and now affects up to one third of the adult population in Western countries [1].NAFLD encompasses a continuum of entities that span from plain steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and ultimately end-stage liver disease [2].Hepatocyte cell death is a critical event in the progression of all chronic inflammatory liver diseases including NAFLD [3].Until recently, two main forms of cell death were recognized: apoptosis, which occurs in a highly controlled manner, and necrosis that is accidentally triggered.However, during the past few years, it became clear that programmed cell death was not restricted to apoptosis, and comprised other forms of regulated cell death [4].Necroptosis is one of them, combining the molecular machinery of the extrinsic apoptotic pathways with an execution similar to necrosis [4].Unlike apoptosis that requires the activation of aspartate-specific proteases known as caspases [5], necroptosis is driven by the activation of the receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 1 and 3, and the pseudo kinase mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) [4].Previous studies have shown that ablation of RIPK3 protected mice from the development of steatohepatitis and fibrosis in a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet mouse model [6, 7].In addition, it has been demonstrated that necroptosis was activated in the hepatocytes of patients with NASH [6-8].Overall, compelling studies have shown that RIP kinases were pleiotropic modulators of cell death and participated in the pathogenesis of many chronic diseases [9].Therefore, there is evidence to suggest that by preventing the formation and/or activation of the necrosome, one could limit cell death and possibly disease progression in NASH.

RIPK1 and MLKL are potential serum markers of activity and promising therapeutic targets in NAFLD. At present, there are limited options to inhibit the necroptosis pathway.Stable inhibitors that may specifically target RIPK3 or MLKL in vivo, are lacking or induce undesirable effects [10].The RIPK1 inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) has been recognized as a potent inhibitor of necroptosis [11].However, it is poorly specific, as it also inhibits the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway.More recently, RIPA-56 was identified as a highly specific and metabolically stable inhibitor of RIPK1 [12].

Severe acute liver injury is a grave complication of exertional heatstroke. Liver transplantation (LT) may be a therapeutic option, but the criteria for LT and the optimal timing of LT have not been clearly established. The aim of this study was to define the profile of patients who require transplantation in this context. This was a multicentre, retrospective study of patients admitted with a diagnosis of exertional heatstroke-related severe acute liver injury with a prothrombin time (PT) of less than 50%. A total of 24 male patients were studied. Fifteen of the 24 patients (median nadir PT: 35% [29.5–40.5]) improved under medical therapy alone and survived. Nine of the 24 were listed for emergency LT. At the time of registration, the median PT was 10% (5–12) and all had numerous dysfunctional organs. Five patients (nadir PT: 12% [9–12]) were withdrawn from the list because of an elevation of PT values that mainly occurred between day 2 and day 3. Ultimately, 4 patients underwent transplantation as their PT persisted at <10%, 3 days (2.75–3.25) after the onset of exertional heatstroke, and they had more than 3 organ dysfunctions. Of these 4 patients, 3 were still alive 1 year later. Histological analysis of the 4 explanted livers demonstrated massive or sub-massive necrosis, and little potential for effective mitoses, characterised by a “mitonecrotic” appearance. The first-line treatment for exertional heatstroke-related severe acute liver injury is medical therapy. LT is only a rare alternative and such a decision should not be taken too hastily. A persistence of PT <10%, without any signs of elevation after a median period of 3  days following the onset of heatstroke, was the trigger that prompted LT, was the trigger adopted in order to decide upon LT. Exertional heatstroke is a rare but serious complication that can occur during intense and prolonged physical exercise in a hot and humid climate.It is mainly characterised by hyperthermia higher than 40 °C associated with central neurological disorders.It occurs in individuals who were previously in good health.1

Liver injury is common in the context of exertional heatstroke.It is usually moderate and characterised by elevated aminotransferase levels.This injury is generally reversible and asymptomatic, although more rarely it may be accompanied by severe liver injury (sALI) or acute liver failure (ALF), both of which have a poor prognosis.This liver injury is clearly due to multiple factors: lesions induced by hyperthermia, hypoxia, endotoxemia, blood coagulation disorders or sepsis.It is often one symptom of severe multiple organ dysfunction or multiple organ failure.The control of body temperature by cooling as soon as the patient is taken in charge is essential and will influence the severity of organ injury.

The indication for liver transplantation (LT) is not clearly established, for 3 main reasons.Firstly, the criteria for LT may be interfered with by the existence of a coagulation disorder (disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC]), which combined with the hepatic lesions may lead to overestimation of the severity of liver failure.2Secondly, liver failure may be reversed at the same time as the failure of other organs, using resuscitation techniques.And thirdly, only a few cases of LT have been reported, so it is not possible to clarify its indication in this context.
Sterile inflammation resulting in alcoholic hepatitis (AH) occurs unpredictably after many years of excess alcohol intake. The factors responsible for the development of AH are not known but mitochondrial damage with loss of mitochondrial function are common features. Hcar2 is a G-protein coupled receptor which is activated by β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). We aimed to determine the relevance of the BHB-Hcar2 pathway in alcoholic liver disease. We tested if loss of BHB production can result in increased liver inflammation. We further tested if BHB supplementation is protective in AH through interaction with Hcar2, and analyzed the immune and cellular basis for protection. Humans with AH have reduced hepatic BHB, and inhibition of BHB production in mice aggravated ethanol-induced AH, with higher plasma alanine aminotransferase levels, increased steatosis and greater neutrophil influx. Conversely supplementation of BHB had the opposite effects with reduced alanine aminotransferase levels, reduced steatosis and neutrophil influx. This therapeutic effect of BHB is dependent on the receptor Hcar2. BHB treatment increased liver Il10 transcripts, and promoted the M2 phenotype of intrahepatic macrophages. BHB also increased the transcriptional level of M2 related genes in vitro bone marrow derived macrophages. This skewing towards M2 related genes is dependent on lower mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) induced by BHB. Collectively, our data shows that BHB production during excess alcohol consumption has an anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective role through an Hcar2 dependent pathway. This introduces the concept of metabolite-based therapy for AH. Excess alcohol intake has many effects on the liver and can present with several clinical syndromes.1One of the most serious is acute alcoholic hepatitis (AH), which occurs unexpectedly after decades of high levels of alcohol consumption, and is characterized by sterile liver inflammation, jaundice and can progress to a systemic inflammatory response.2There is a mixed inflammatory infiltrate characterized by neutrophils, and upregulation of a variety of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6.Due to the ubiquitous development of hepatocyte steatosis there has been sustained interest in aspects of mitochondrial function related to lipid metabolism, particularly mitochondrial β-oxidation.3In vivo and in vitro models have shown diverse effects of alcohol on mitochondrial biology including abnormal mitochondrial morphology (giant mitochondria), mitochondrial DNA fragmentation, deceased mitochondrial protein synthesis by inhibition of mitochondrial ribosome activity, and oxidation of mitochondrial proteins.3Measurement of the steps in β-oxidation has demonstrated inhibition after acute and chronic alcohol exposure, which is caused by downregulation of genes involved in fatty acid uptake as well as oxidation.4,5

Conversely supplementation of BHB had the opposite effects with reduced alanine aminotransferase levels, reduced steatosis and neutrophil influx. This therapeutic effect of BHB is dependent on the receptor Hcar2. BHB treatment increased liver Il10 transcripts, and promoted the M2 phenotype of intrahepatic macrophages. BHB also increased the transcriptional level of M2 related genes in vitro bone marrow derived macrophages. This skewing towards M2 related genes is dependent on lower mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) induced by BHB. Collectively, our data shows that BHB production during excess alcohol consumption has an anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective role through an Hcar2 dependent pathway. This introduces the concept of metabolite-based therapy for AH. To understand the factors that initiate AH a variety of pro-inflammatory changes have been identified, with data supporting a role for increased intestinal permeability allowing bacterial products to enter the hepatic circulation and initiate an inflammatory response.6A compatible hypothesis is that toxic-metabolic injury to hepatocytes from alcohol results in the release of intracellular molecules generically termed damage associated molecular patterns which initiate, and can then establish a pro-inflammatory loop.7There has been much less attention devoted to identifying the opposite, and equally plausible, scenario of a reduction in anti-inflammatory pathways resulting in AH.As described above, many types of mitochondrial changes induced by alcohol have been identified, but at present there is no link between changes in mitochondrial metabolites and liver inflammation.These considerations raised the possibility that if some of the usual products of mitochondrial metabolism have anti-inflammatory activity, with increasing mitochondrial damage their loss may trigger AH.We focused on the reduction in β-oxidation by alcohol, because one of the products of β-oxidation is β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB).BHB is of interest because in addition to being an energy source, it is also a ligand for the plasma membrane receptor Hcar2 and is known to have immunomodulatory functions via ligating Hcar2, inhibiting inflammasome activation, and via histone deacetylase inhibition.8–10This raises the possibility that ethanol-induced reduction in β-oxidation, in addition to causing hepatocyte steatosis, may also contribute to liver inflammation by reduction in BHB induced immunomodulation.
Sterile inflammation resulting in alcoholic hepatitis (AH) occurs unpredictably after many years of excess alcohol intake. The factors responsible for the development of AH are not known but mitochondrial damage with loss of mitochondrial function are common features. Hcar2 is a G-protein coupled receptor which is activated by β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). We aimed to determine the relevance of the BHB-Hcar2 pathway in alcoholic liver disease. We tested if loss of BHB production can result in increased liver inflammation. We further tested if BHB supplementation is protective in AH through interaction with Hcar2, and analyzed the immune and cellular basis for protection. Humans with AH have reduced hepatic BHB, and inhibition of BHB production in mice aggravated ethanol-induced AH, with higher plasma alanine aminotransferase levels, increased steatosis and greater neutrophil influx. Conversely supplementation of BHB had the opposite effects with reduced alanine aminotransferase levels, reduced steatosis and neutrophil influx. This therapeutic effect of BHB is dependent on the receptor Hcar2. BHB treatment increased liver Il10 transcripts, and promoted the M2 phenotype of intrahepatic macrophages. BHB also increased the transcriptional level of M2 related genes in vitro bone marrow derived macrophages. This skewing towards M2 related genes is dependent on lower mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) induced by BHB. Collectively, our data shows that BHB production during excess alcohol consumption has an anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective role through an Hcar2 dependent pathway. This introduces the concept of metabolite-based therapy for AH. To test the effect of reduced BHB production in the setting of alcohol-induced liver injury we applied alcohol gavage with and without chemical inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1), a key step in beta-oxidation.This is a relevant experimental approach because long term consumption of alcohol induces down regulation of CPT-1 and inhibition of beta oxidation.11By using a direct CPT-1 inhibitor we can test the specific effect of inhibition of beta-oxidation and reduced BHB production, independently from the many other effects of chronic alcohol consumption.
The impact of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection on outcomes after resection of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) has not been reported. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of antiviral therapy on survival outcomes after liver resection for patients with ICC and underlying HBV infection. Data on 928 patients with ICC and HBV infection who underwent liver resection at two medical centers between 2006 and 2011 were analyzed. Data on viral reactivation, tumor recurrence, cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were obtained. Survival rates were analyzed using the time-dependent Cox regression model adjusted for potential covariates. Postoperative viral reactivation occurred in 3.3%, 8.3% and 15.7% of patients who received preoperative antiviral therapy, who did not receive preoperative antiviral therapy with a low, or a high HBV-DNA level (< or ≥2,000 IU/ml), respectively (p <0.001). A high viral level and viral reactivation were independent risk factors of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 1.22 and 1.34), CSS (HR 1.36 and 1.46) and OS (HR 1.23 and 1.36). Five-year recurrence, CSS and OS were better in patients who received antiviral therapy (70.5%, 46.9% and 43.0%) compared with patients who did not receive antiviral therapy and had a high viral level (86.5%, 20.9% and 20.5%, all p <0.001), respectively. The differences in recurrence, CSS and OS were minimal compared with no-antiviral therapy patients with a low viral level (71.7%, 35.5% and 33.5%, p = 0.057, 0.051 and 0.060, respectively). Compared to patients with a high viral level who received no antiviral therapy, patients who initiated antiviral therapy either before or after surgery had better long-term outcomes (HR 0.44 and 0.54 for recurrence; 0.38 and 0.57 for CSS; 0.46 and 0.54 for OS, respectively). Viral reactivation was associated with worse prognoses after liver resection for HBV-infected patients with ICC. Antiviral therapy decreased viral reactivation and prolonged long-term survival for patients with ICC and a high viral level. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) accounts for 10%–20% of primary liver cancer, with an incidence second only to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).1In addition, the incidence and related mortality of ICC are dramatically increasing worldwide.1,2Currently, liver resection (LR) is the only established treatment to achieve possible long-term survival for patients with ICC,1,3 with an associated five-year survival ranging from 26.4% to 35.2%.4,5The poor long-term outcomes following resection are related to the aggressive and invasive nature of this malignancy.6,7

Viral reactivation was associated with worse prognoses after liver resection for HBV-infected patients with ICC. Antiviral therapy decreased viral reactivation and prolonged long-term survival for patients with ICC and a high viral level. There are multiple risk factors associated with the development of ICC.1Specifically, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are important risk factors for the disease,8–10 with HBV infection being more prevalent in Asia and other high incidence regions of ICC.8,9A recent meta-analysis demonstrated a close association between the incidence of HBV infection and occurrence of ICC (odds ratio [OR] 3.17; 95% CI 1.88–5.34).8Unfortunately, knowledge on the underlying mechanism(s) of this association is still limited.It is possible that HBV x protein (HBx) acts as a trans-activating protein by binding to nuclear transcription factors to stimulate the intracellular signaling pathways that promote tumor cell growth.11HBV infection may also induce liver progenitor cell activation, which when accompanied by abnormal genetic changes caused by HBx activation, contributes to malignant transformation.12
Acute liver failure is a rapidly progressive deterioration of hepatic function resulting in high mortality and morbidity. Metabolic enzymes can translocate to the nucleus to regulate histone acetylation and gene expression. Levels and activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were evaluated in nuclear fractions of livers of mice exposed to various hepatotoxins including CD95-antibody, α-amanitin, and acetaminophen. Whole-genome gene expression profiling by RNA-seq was performed in livers of mice with acute liver failure and analyzed by gene ontology enrichment analysis. Cell viability was evaluated in cell lines knocked-down for PDHA1 or LDH-A and in cells incubated with the LDH inhibitor galloflavin after treatment with CD95-antibody. We evaluated whether the histone acetyltransferase inhibitor garcinol or galloflavin could reduce liver damage in mice with acute liver failure. Levels and activities of PDHC and LDH were increased in nuclear fractions of livers of mice with acute liver failure. The increase of nuclear PDHC and LDH was associated with increased concentrations of acetyl-CoA and lactate in nuclear fractions, and histone H3 hyper-acetylation. Gene expression in livers of mice with acute liver failure suggested that increased histone H3 acetylation induces the expression of genes related to damage response. Reduced histone acetylation by the histone acetyltransferase inhibitor garcinol decreased liver damage and improved survival in mice with acute liver failure. Knock-down of PDHC or LDH improved viability in cells exposed to a pro-apoptotic stimulus. Treatment with the LDH inhibitor galloflavin that was also found to inhibit PDHC, reduced hepatic necrosis, apoptosis, and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice with acute liver failure. Mice treated with galloflavin also showed a dose-response increase in survival. PDHC and LDH translocate to the nucleus, leading to increased nuclear concentrations of acetyl-CoA and lactate. This results in histone H3 hyper-acetylation and expression of damage response genes. Inhibition of PDHC and LDH reduces liver damage and improves survival in mice with acute liver failure. Thus, PDHC and LDH are targets for therapy of acute liver failure. Acute liver failure is a rapidly progressive, life-threatening deterioration of liver function that results in altered neurological state and coagulopathy.The only treatment that improves the outcome of acute liver failure is emergency liver transplantation.Because liver transplantation has limitations related to invasiveness, limited donor availability and high mortality, therapies for acute liver failure are urgently needed.

Moonlighting of metabolic enzymes in the nucleus has been recognized as an important mechanism linking metabolic flux to regulation of gene expression.1Dynamic nuclear translocation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and increased acetyl-CoA affect histone acetylation and epigenetic regulation.2Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is also detected in the nucleus3,4 where it generates lactate.Lactate has global effects on gene transcription which overlap with the changes induced by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors.5
Liver function tests (LFTs) are frequently requested blood tests which may indicate liver disease. LFTs are commonly abnormal, the causes of which can be complex and are frequently under investigated. This can lead to missed opportunities to diagnose and treat liver disease at an early stage. We developed an automated investigation algorithm, intelligent liver function testing (iLFT), with the aim of increasing the early diagnosis of liver disease in a cost-effective manner. We developed an automated system that further investigated abnormal LFTs on initial testing samples to generate a probable diagnosis and management plan. We integrated this automated investigation algorithm into the laboratory management system, based on minimal diagnostic criteria, liver fibrosis estimation, and reflex testing for causes of liver disease. This algorithm then generated a diagnosis and/or management plan. A stepped-wedged trial design was utilised to compare LFT outcomes in general practices in the 6 months before and after introduction of the iLFT system. Diagnostic outcomes were collated and compared. Of eligible patients with abnormal LFTs, 490 were recruited to the control group and 64 were recruited to the intervention group. The primary diagnostic outcome was based on the general practitioner diagnosis, which agreed with the iLFT diagnosis in 67% of cases. In the iLFT group, the diagnosis of liver disease was increased by 43%. Additionally, there were significant increases in the rates of GP visits after diagnosis and the number of referrals to secondary care in the iLFT group. iLFT was cost-effective with a low initial incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £284 per correct diagnosis, and a saving to the NHS of £3,216 per patient lifetime. iLFT increases liver disease diagnoses, improves quality of care, and is highly cost-effective. This can be achieved with minor changes to working practices and exploitation of functionality existing within modern laboratory diagnostics systems. There has been an exponential increase in the number of liver function tests (LFTs) requested in general practice.1,2A proportion are checked for the investigation of liver disease but most are for investigating undifferentiated illness, or monitoring non-hepatic long-term health conditions.3–5It is unknown how significant a solitary abnormal LFT result is;1 does it signify current or future liver disease, disease in other organs, or is it a temporary phenomenon of little clinical relevance?6

Studies have shown that approximately 20% of initial LFTs are abnormal.1The cause of LFT abnormalities vary geographically and the cost effectiveness of additional testing will vary also.Additional diagnostic tests such as ultrasound or screening blood tests may still leave many abnormal LFTs unexplained.2,7Further investigations such as liver biopsy are invasive and expensive.8Primary care guidelines on the evaluation of abnormal liver enzyme results, in asymptomatic individuals, do not take the costs to the patient or the health service into account.8,9

The commonest causes of abnormal LFTs leading to chronic liver disease in the UK and most developed countries are non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),10 alcohol-related liver disease (ALD),11 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.12All pose a considerable economic burden on the health service.13,14However there are many other causes of abnormal LFTs that need to be considered; including biliary disease, drug reactions, systemic illness, malignancy and hepatic infections.15,16Despite the increasing use of LFTs, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which may have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.6Early detection may improve prognosis and treatment options, whilst diagnostic delay may be damaging to patients and to professional reputations.

There have been few population studies to date that have quantified liver disease following abnormal LFTs.17–20Duh et al.17 quantified the incidence of liver enzyme abnormalities in the general population in Massachusetts, USA.There was no long-term follow-up to eventual liver disease diagnosis.A large cohort study in Korea (n = 142,055) reported the association between the LFT serum aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) and mortality from liver disease, indicating that even values that were in the upper quartile of the normal range were associated with worse outcome.1,18Our previous study used electronic case record linkage to diagnose liver disease and this project showed that 20% of all LFTs measured were found to be abnormal with less than 10% of these explained by existing liver disease.21

To investigate this further we studied the outcomes of individuals up to 15 years post LFT measurement in primary care.22Over 60% of the catchment population had LFTs measured.A total of 2,189,152 LFTs were first checked in primary care in 95,992 people.Of these 21.7% were abnormal and 1.26% went on to have a diagnosis of chronic liver disease (hepatocellular causes) while 1.61% developed biliary disease (including gallbladder and biliary tract disease).

This can be achieved with minor changes to working practices and exploitation of functionality existing within modern laboratory diagnostics systems. The intelligent liver function test (iLFT) system was developed to promote appropriate investigation of abnormal LFTs in primary care by utilising minimum diagnostic criteria, the availability of automated tracked analysers and liver fibrosis markers with high negative predictive values.A working group convened by the Scottish Government Liver Care Pathway Advisory group used an extensive literature review and expert opinion to achieve professional consensus on minimum diagnostic criteria for liver diseases.Highly specific diagnostic criteria have been identified for each liver disease based on a few simple clinical observations e.g. body mass index (BMI), alcohol intake, presence or absence of metabolic syndrome, and blood test results.This allows diagnosis using a minimal range of robust diagnostic criteria but gives confidence that those identified do indeed have the disease.The system is not designed to put everyone in a diagnostic group, just those that meet the criteria.It is designed to fail safe, always defaulting to further clinical evaluation if there is diagnostic uncertainty.6Technological developments within diagnostic laboratories have led to the use of automated tracked analysers where patient samples are passed between analysers to deliver a wide repertoire of tests under computer control.In real time the system can change a sample’s journey based on the preceding results (reflexive testing) i.e. if a result outside of a threshold value is detected, the system can use a pre-programmed algorithm to trigger additional tests automatically.Combining results with clinical information provided through the electronic ordering system enables the laboratory information management system to calculate prognostic indices and allocate a suggested diagnosis.The crucial point in determining management and need for referral to hepatology for expert review and further investigation for the common liver diseases is the degree of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, as many with no fibrosis can be treated with lifestyle advice.Non-invasive fibrosis indices are effective at excluding significant fibrosis and many of these indices can be calculated using routinely available clinical laboratory analytes.26–28
Liver fibrosis is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular matrix produced by hepatic myofibroblasts (hMF), the activation of which is critical to the fibrogenic process. Extracellular ATP, released by dying or stressed cells, and its purinergic receptors, constitute a powerful signaling network after injury. Although the purinergic receptor P2X4 (P2RX4) is highly expressed in the liver, its functions in hMF had never been investigated during liver fibrogenesis. In vivo, bile duct ligation was performed and methionine- and choline-deficient diet administered in wild-type and P2x4 knock-out (P2x4-KO) mice. In vitro, hMF were isolated from mouse (wild-type and P2x4-KO) and human liver. P2X4 pharmacological inhibition (in vitro and in vivo) and P2X4 siRNAs (in vitro) were used. Histological, biochemical and cell culture analysis allowed us to study P2X4 expression and its involvement in the regulation of fibrogenic and fibrolytic factors, as well as of hMF activation markers and properties. P2X4 genetic invalidation or pharmacological inhibition protected mice from liver fibrosis and hMF accumulation after bile duct ligation or methionine- and choline-deficient diet. Human and mouse hMFs expressed P2X4, mainly in lysosomes. Invalidation of P2X4 in human and mouse hMFs blunted their activation marker expression and their fibrogenic properties. Finally, we showed that P2X4 regulates calcium entry and lysosomal exocytosis in hMF, impacting on ATP release, profibrogenic secretory profile, and transcription factor activation. P2X4 expression and activation is critical for hMF to sustain their activated and fibrogenic phenotype. Therefore, the inactivation of P2X4 may be of therapeutic interest during liver fibrotic diseases. Beside huge regenerative properties, the liver classically undergoes fibrogenesis in association with liver repair during chronic injury, impairing hepatic functions with high morbidity and mortality.1As well as in other organs, in the liver, the main cellular contributor to excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition is the myofibroblast, derived from hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and/or portal fibroblasts2 after acute or during chronic liver injury.Hepatic myofibroblasts (hMF) are characterized by αSMA (ACTA2) expression, contractile properties, and by overexpressed ECM components and regulators.The acquisition of an ECM remodeling phenotype in hMF during liver injury is strongly dependent on a complex network of cellular interactions within the liver microenvironment, involving a large number of cytokines and growth factors.1Nevertheless, the so-called “danger activated molecular patterns”, released by dying or stressed cells during injury, including extracellular ATP, also constitute a powerful signaling network which impact on liver fibrogenetic processes.3,4In general, signaling via extracellular ATP and its receptors, i.e. P2Y (G protein-coupled receptors) and P2X (ligand-gated ion channels), is reported to have regulatory impact on fundamental processes like secretion, contraction, survival and proliferation in a wide spectrum of cells and tissues, including the liver.5,6ATP release from cells occurs under different stress conditions, particularly under osmotic or mechanical challenge.7In the liver, each cell type expresses its own repertoire of purinoceptor subtypes and ectoATPases,8 P2X4 (P2RX4) and P2X7 (P2RX7) often being predominant among P2 receptor subtypes.9,10We previously observed robust ATP release from the liver immediately after partial hepatectomy (PH) in rats and in human living transplant donors, resulting from intrahepatic mechanical stress and contributing to hepatocyte cell cycle entry.11In a recent study in mice, we proposed that during liver regeneration after PH, ATP signaling through P2X4 contributed to the control of biliary homeostasis, with a resulting impact on hepatocyte protection and proliferation, through basic mechanisms involving exocytosis of lysosomes, an organelle in which P2X4 is strongly expressed.10Beside evidence for a purinergic-dependent regulation of liver repair after acute injury,10–13 only few data are available as far as chronic liver injury and fibrogenesis are concerned.Previous studies in the context of liver fibrosis reported that adenosine (ATP's breakdown product), and its A1 and A2 receptors provide profibrogenic signals,14 at least in part through modulation of macrophage or HSC activation,15 although some contradictory results have been reported.16Regarding the P2 side of purinergic input signaling during liver fibrosis, while some P2Y isoforms have been reported to be expressed and to play some role in HSC-myofibroblast differentiation,17,18 most of the recent studies were focused on P2X7 signaling.In mice, pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of P2X7 resulted in less carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced liver fibrosis,19,20 through incompletely defined cell-specific mechanisms, including impact on splanchnic hemodynamics20 and myofibroblast activation and/or inflammasome induction.21–23However, a clear picture of the purinergic-related control of liver fibrogenesis is still lacking, in particular according to cell types, ligands and receptors involved, and finally depending on the experimental model used.Indeed, biliary and non-biliary type fibrosis appeared to exhibit differential sensitivity to purinergic signals and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.16,18Importantly, other P2 receptors, including the highly expressed P2X4, were not investigated in the context of liver fibrogenesis.As P2X4 was reported to regulate secretion of inflammatory mediators,24 cytoskeleton organisation25 and collagen deposition26 in extrahepatic sites, we aimed at studying the impact of P2X4 on hMF phenotype and liver fibrogenesis.
To eliminate hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, it is essential to scale up antiviral treatment through decentralized services. However, access to the conventional tools to assess treatment eligibility (liver biopsy/Fibroscan®/HBV DNA) is limited and not affordable in resource-limited countries. We developed and validated a simple score to easily identify patients in need of HBV treatment in Africa. As a reference, we used treatment eligibility determined by the European Association for the Study of the Liver based on alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver histology and/or Fibroscan and HBV DNA. We derived a score indicating treatment eligibility by a stepwise logistic regression using a cohort of chronic HBV infection in The Gambia (n = 804). We subsequently validated the score in an external cohort of HBV-infected Africans from Senegal, Burkina Faso, and Europe (n = 327). Out of several parameters, two remained in the final model, namely HBV e antigen (HBeAg) and ALT level, constituting a simple score (treatment eligibility in Africa for the hepatitis B virus: TREAT-B). The score demonstrated a high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.85, 95% CI 0.79–0.91) in the validation set. The score of 2 and above (HBeAg-positive and ALT ≥20 U/L or HBeAg-negative and ALT ≥40 U/L) had a sensitivity and specificity for treatment eligibility of 85% and 77%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the World Health Organization criteria based on the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and ALT were 90% and 40%, respectively. A simple score based on HBeAg and ALT had a high diagnostic accuracy for the selection of patients for HBV treatment. This score could be useful in African settings. Viral hepatitis is a major global health problem.In 2013, an estimated 1.45 million people died from viral hepatitis.1This is the seventh leading cause of death worldwide, ranked higher than any of the major infectious agents: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis and malaria.Of these hepatitis-related deaths, most of them occur in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), and about half are attributable to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, causing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).1

In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed an ambitious strategy to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030, aiming to reduce the incidence of chronic HBV infection by 90%, and its mortality by 65%.2The WHO also set a global target for treatment coverage in people with chronic HBV infection eligible for antiviral therapy from 8% (2015) to 80% (2030).3

To scale up and decentralize screening, clinical assessment and treatment services in LMICs, it is essential to develop simple and validated diagnostic tests that are feasible and affordable in these contexts.4HBV screening using inexpensive rapid tests that accurately detect hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has performed well in community and outreach settings,5,6 and the cost of antiviral treatment should no longer be the main obstacle (<US$ 50 per year).3,7Nevertheless, the clinical evaluation of treatment eligibility after confirming positive HBsAg remains complex and expensive.Because the current antiviral treatment is lifelong for most people, and not all chronic HBV infections result in liver-related deaths, the international guidelines require selection of patients who potentially benefit from the antiviral therapy by evaluating three factors: viral replication, liver fibrosis and inflammation.8–10However, the recommended tools to assess these conditions (nucleic acid test to measure HBV DNA levels, liver biopsy and Fibroscan® to evaluate fibrosis stage) are rarely accessible and affordable in LMICs.11,12
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol-related liver disease pose an important challenge to current clinical healthcare pathways because of the large number of at-risk patients. Therefore, we aimed to explore the cost-effectiveness of transient elastography (TE) as a screening method to detect liver fibrosis in a primary care pathway. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using real-life individual patient data from 6 independent prospective cohorts (5 from Europe and 1 from Asia). A diagnostic algorithm with conditional inference trees was developed to explore the relationships between liver stiffness, socio-demographics, comorbidities, and hepatic fibrosis, the latter assessed by fibrosis scores (FIB-4, NFS) and liver biopsies in a subset of 352 patients. We compared the incremental cost-effectiveness of a screening strategy against standard of care alongside the numbers needed to screen to diagnose a patient with fibrosis stage ≥F2. The data set encompassed 6,295 participants (mean age 55 ± 12 years, BMI 27 ± 5 kg/m2, liver stiffness 5.6 ± 5.0 kPa). A 9.1 kPa TE cut-off provided the best accuracy for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis (≥F2) in general population settings, whereas a threshold of 9.5 kPa was optimal for populations at-risk of alcohol-related liver disease. TE with the proposed cut-offs outperformed fibrosis scores in terms of accuracy. Screening with TE was cost-effective with mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from 2,570 €/QALY (95% CI 2,456–2,683) for a population at-risk of alcohol-related liver disease (age ≥45 years) to 6,217 €/QALY (95% CI 5,832–6,601) in the general population. Overall, there was a 12% chance of TE screening being cost saving across countries and populations. Screening for liver fibrosis with TE in primary care is a cost-effective intervention for European and Asian populations and may even be cost saving. Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are leading causes of chronic liver diseases, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-related deaths worldwide.1,2While the causes, consequences and treatment strategies for ALD and NAFLD are being studied and developed,3–5 the majority of patients are still diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease.6Consequently, the course of action towards early disease detection from a public health perspective remains a grey area in hepatology.7

Screening for liver fibrosis with TE in primary care is a cost-effective intervention for European and Asian populations and may even be cost saving. Severe fibrosis and cirrhosis is the major predictor of excess mortality, liver transplantation and liver-related events in patients with NAFLD and ALD.8,9Consequently, early detection before progression to advanced fibrosis might be more beneficial and cost-effective, as it allows for timely lifestyle interventions, patient guidance, and disease monitoring.

Screening for liver fibrosis with TE in primary care is a cost-effective intervention for European and Asian populations and may even be cost saving. The high prevalence of ALD and NAFLD, in combination with the slow, asymptomatic disease progression, quickly translate into pressure on our healthcare systems, specifically on general practitioners and primary healthcare specialists.The search for optimal patient management and care pathways is thus of utmost importance, including preventive screening programmes.10

The search for non-invasive diagnostic tools for the staging of liver fibrosis in NAFLD and ALD has widened.Transient elastography (TE) has been shown to be a reliable diagnostic tool for fibrosis assessment.11,12Use of TE could lead to highly cost-effective care pathways as compared to magnetic resonance elastography due to significantly lower cost per test. 13,14,15Other alternatives, mostly based on serum biomarkers such as the Fibrosis-4 score (FIB-4) or the NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS), have also been developed and validated.16

Recently, there have been individual attempts in the literature to assess prevalence rates, diagnostic accuracy and potential algorithms to stratify patients at risk of severe fibrosis.17–22However, mainly due to the limited sample size and the heterogeneity of populations and healthcare systems, a broader assessment of the technology implementation, encompassing both health and economic outcomes is lacking.
Liver adenomatosis (LA) is characterized by the presence of at least 10 hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs), but the natural history of this rare liver disorder remains unclear. Thus, we aimed to reappraise the natural history and the risk of complications in a cohort of patients with at least 10 HCAs. We analyzed the natural history of 40 patients with LA, excluding glycogen storage disorders, in a monocentric cohort. Pathological examination was performed, with immunostaining and molecular biology carried out on surgical specimens or liver biopsies. Forty patients (36 female) were included with a median follow-up of 10.6 (1.9–26.1) years. Six (15%) patients had familial LA, all with germline HNF1A mutations. Median age at diagnosis was 39 (9–55) years. Thirty-three (94%) women had a history of oral contraception, and 29 (81%) women had a pregnancy before LA diagnosis. Overall, thirty-seven (93%) patients underwent surgery at diagnosis. Classification of HCAs showed 46% of patients with HNF1A-mutated HCA, 31% with inflammatory HCA, 3% with sonic hedgehog HCA, 8% with unclassified HCA. Only 15% of the patients demonstrated a “mixed LA” with different HCA subtypes. Hepatic complications were identified in 7 patients: 1 patient (3%) died from recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplantation; 6 (15%) had hemorrhages, of which 5 occurred at diagnosis, with 1 fatal case during pregnancy, and 2 occurred in male patients with familial LA. Four patients (10%) had repeated liver resections. Finally, 4 (10%) patients developed extrahepatic malignancies during follow-up. The diversity in HCA subtypes, as well as the occurrence of bleeding and malignant transformation during long-term follow-up, underline the heterogeneous nature of LA, justifying close and specific management. In patients with germline HNF1A mutation, familial LA occurred equally frequently in males and females, with a higher rate of bleeding in male patients. Hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) are rare benign liver tumors that increased in frequency after the wide prescription of oral contraceptive pills in the 1960s.Currently the prevalence of HCAs ranges between 1 and 4 per 100,000 individuals.1Owing to its estrogen-dependence, the female to male ratio is 10:1 and HCAs predominantly affect young women around 30–40 years old.2,3The 2 major risks of HCAs are symptomatic hemorrhage and malignant transformation, which are estimated to occur in 15% and 5% of cases in surgical series, respectively.3,4Lesion size greater >5 cm is a risk factor for both complications, while male sex is a risk factor for malignant transformation.3,5

In patients with germline HNF1A mutation, familial LA occurred equally frequently in males and females, with a higher rate of bleeding in male patients. A step forward in the understanding of HCA pathogenesis has been made with the molecular classifications developed since 2001 and recently updated.2,6–9This molecular classification identifies 8 different subtypes of HCA correlated with clinical and histopathological features: (1) HNF1A inactivated HCA (HHCA), accounting for 34% of cases and usually massively steatotic; (2) β-catenin activated HCAs with exon 3 mutations (bex3HCA), associated with a higher risk of malignant transformation, or (3) β-catenin activated HCAs with exon 7 or 8 mutations (bex7,8HCA), associated with a lower risk of malignant transformation, which occur in 7% and 4% of cases, respectively; (4) inflammatory HCA (IHCA), which occurs in 34% of cases and is characterized by mutations in either IL6ST, STAT3, JAK1, GNAS, FRK, or IL6, somatic alterations, and is associated with metabolic syndrome and alcohol intake; (5) sonic hedgehog activated HCA (shHCA) with aberrant overexpression of GLI1 due to INHBE/GLI1 fusion accounts for 4% of HCAs and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding;6,7 mixed inflammatory HCA with activated β-catenin, with (6) a mutation in exon 3 (bex3IHCA) or (7) in exon 7/8 of the CTNNB1 gene (bex7,8IHCA), which account for 6% and 4% of cases, respectively; (8) the tumors that remained unclassified (UHCA) in 7%.

For these patients, European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) clinical practice guidelines1 recommend to correct risk factors when possible, mainly by stopping oral contraception or androgen intake, and modifying lifestyle to lose weight.Taking into account the high risk of complications, liver resection is often proposed for HCAs in men, for large HCA (>5 cm) in women with a more aggressive strategy in all HCAs with β-catenin activation.Transarterial embolization represents an alternative treatment currently being evaluated for HCAs.10

In patients with germline HNF1A mutation, familial LA occurred equally frequently in males and females, with a higher rate of bleeding in male patients. Liver adenomatosis (LA) was first described by Monges et al.11 and Monaco et al.12 in the early 1960s.Later in 1985, Flejou et al.13 defined LA by the presence of 10 or more HCAs, both in men and women.LA can develop on underlying liver pathology, such as glycogen storage disease or vascular abnormalities like portal vein agenesis,14 but also on normal livers.A familial form associated with diabetes was described by Foster et al.15 and in 2003 germline HNF1A (also termed TCF1) inactivation, usually associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3), was identified in patients with familial LA exhibiting steatotic HCAs with bi-allelic inactivating mutations of HNF1A in the tumors.16,17The presence of multiple HCAs raises the question of how best to manage them, especially when liver resection is not possible because of the number and location of tumors.Some rare indications for liver transplantation have been reported.14The EASL clinical practice guidelines1 recommend that the management of patients with multiple HCAs should be based on the size of the largest tumor, as clinical presentation and risk of bleeding or malignancy do not differ between patients with single or multiple HCAs.However, the natural history of LA is poorly described in the literature.
Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D) is an autosomal recessive condition that may present in a mild form (cholesteryl ester storage disease [CESD]), which mimics non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It has been suggested that CESD may affect 1 in 40,000 and is under-diagnosed in NAFLD clinics. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of LAL-D using analysis of genetic variation in LIPA. MEDLINE and EMBASE were systematically searched for previously reported disease variants and prevalence estimates. Previous prevalence estimates were meta-analysed. Disease variants in LIPA were annotated with allele frequencies from gnomAD and combined with unreported major functional variants found in humans. Pooled ethnicity-specific prevalences for LAL-D and CESD were calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg equation. Meta-analysis of existing genetic studies estimated the prevalence of LAL-D as 1 per 160,000 (95% CI 1 per 65,025–761,652) using the allele frequency of c.894G>A in LIPA. A total of 98 previously reported disease variants in LIPA were identified, of which 32/98 were present in gnomAD, giving a prevalence of 1 per 307,482 (95% CI 257,672–366,865). Wolman disease was associated with more loss-of-function variants than CESD. When this was combined with 22 previously unreported major functional variants in LIPA identified in humans, the pooled prevalence of LAL-D was 1 per 177,452 (95% CI 149,467–210,683) with a carrier frequency of 1 per 421. The prevalence is lowest in those of East Asian, South Asian, and Finnish ancestry. Using 120 disease variants in LIPA, these data can reassure clinicians that LAL-D is an ultra-rare disorder. Given the therapeutic capability of sebelipase alpha, investigation for LAL-D might be included in second-line metabolic screening in NAFLD. Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in LIPA that manifest as a spectrum of liver disease and dyslipidaemia.1,2It is regarded as a rare disorder however recognition of more mild forms of the condition have led to the suggestion that it may represent a significant proportion of patients presenting with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).3,4Emerging data have also reported reduced lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) activity in association with more advanced NAFLD.5–8Clarity on the prevalence of LAL-D, and its distribution across ethnicities, is needed to determine whether LAL activity testing should be a routine part of NAFLD clinics.

Given the therapeutic capability of sebelipase alpha, investigation for LAL-D might be included in second-line metabolic screening in NAFLD. LIPA encodes the lipase A protein, which functions to catalyse the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in the lysosome.9,10Loss-of-function mutations are associated with the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in lysosomes in hepatocytes, macrophages, and the spleen.LAL-D describes a spectrum of clinical disease where its most severe form is Wolman disease (WD) (with <1% LIPA activity), presenting with acute liver failure at under 4 months of age, microvesicular steatosis, hepatosplenomegaly, failure to thrive, and adrenal calcification.Without treatment, WD is fatal at under a year, but enzyme replacement therapy significantly improves prognosis.

Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) is used to refer to a more mild form of the disorder, characterised by 1–5% LIPA activity.11,12It presents insidiously with elevated aminotransferases, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidaemia, gradual decline in hepatic function, and premature atherosclerosis.These conditions are difficult to diagnose; it is unclear how many children die of undiagnosed WD and there is currently no consensus on routine testing for LIPA activity in adults presenting with NAFLD.

The true prevalence of LAL-D (both CESD and WD) is not known.The most common LIPA variant associated with CESD is a splice-junction mutation in exon 8 (rs116928232: c.894G>A, p.S275_Q298del), referred to as E8SJM,13 which has been used to derive an estimated prevalence as high as 1 per 40,000.This is much higher than clinical observations, leading to the suggestion that LAL-D is under-diagnosed and may be unmasked in patients presenting with NAFLD.3,14–16

It is also not yet established whether heterozygous carriers of pathogenic LIPA variants are at increased risk of progressive liver disease in combination with other insults to the hepatic parenchyma.Data are conflicting as to whether the heterozygous carrier state influences circulating lipid profile.17,18
Multiple organ failures (OFs) are common in patients with cirrhosis, but the independent effect of the number or type of OFs on liver transplantation (LT) outcomes is not well defined. United Network for Organ Sharing data were analyzed from 2002 to 2016 for all adults listed for LT who received an LT within 30 days after listing. We estimated post-LT survival stratified by number and type of pre-transplant OFs before and after adjusting for confounding variables. During the study period, 4,714 (4.1%) patients died and 19,375 (16.6%) patients were transplanted within 30 days of listing. One or more OF were more common in those who were transplanted (57.4%) compared to those without LT (9.5%). The probability of staying alive more than 30 days on the waiting list without LT decreased with increasing number of OFs; while 90% were alive without OF, only 20% were alive with two OFs, and 2–8% with three or more OFs. The interval between listing and transplantation decreased with an increase in OFs, and the median time to transplant after listing was only 4–5 days with three or more OFs. Although the risk of post-LT mortality increased with increasing number of OFs, the 90-day patient survival was 90% and one-year survival was 81% in the presence of 5–6 OFs. The number of OFs was an independent predictor of survival, but the maximum difference in one-year graft or patient survival between those without OF and those with 5–6 OFs was only 9%. Additionally, the type of OF had minimal impact on outcomes. Liver transplantation is feasible with excellent outcomes, even in the presence of five or six OFs. Patients with advanced liver disease may develop one or more organ failures (OFs) when acute decompensation occurs.Acute decompensation is often precipitated by hepatic or extra-hepatic insults such as infections, gastrointestinal bleeding, reactivation of viral hepatitis or alcohol abuse.1–7Recently there has been a renewed interest in the impact of OFs on short-term mortality of patients with chronic liver diseases.1–4,8–10It has been suggested that those who develop OF after acute decompensation may have a different pathophysiology and prognosis compared to those who decompensate without the development of OF.The term acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) has been used recently to describe this entity.Although studies from Asia, Europe and North America have used different definitions to describe OF, and hence ACLF, these studies have consistently shown that patients with multiple OF have poor short-term outcomes, irrespective of the precipitating cause of decompensation.1–4,11–13These studies, based on relatively small sample sizes, also showed that mortality increased with increasing number of OFs, with 30-day mortality reaching well over 80% in those with 3–4 OFs.Patients with cirrhosis who experience an acute decompensating event and develop one or more OFs utilize enormous resources since they are managed in the intensive care units, often requiring dialysis and ventilatory support, while awaiting spontaneous recovery or liver transplantation (LT).There are, however, only limited data on the effectiveness or futility of LT in the setting of patients with multiple OF.11–21
Data regarding the nephrotoxicity of sofosbuvir (SOF) remain controversial. We compared the changes of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection receiving SOF-based or SOF-free direct acting antivirals (DAAs). 481 patients with compensated liver diseases and eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73m2 receiving SOF-based (n = 308) or SOF-free (n = 173) DAAs for 12 weeks were prospectively enrolled. The eGFR was assessed from baseline to off-therapy week 24 by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. The eGFR evolutions between regimens were compared by generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM). Multivariate analysis was performed for factors affecting eGFR evolution. Patients receiving SOF-based DAAs had a significant on-treatment eGFR decline (adjusted slope coefficient difference: -1.24 mL/min/1.73m2/month [95% CI: -1.35 to -1.13]; p < 0.001) and a significant off-therapy eGFR improvement (adjusted slope coefficient difference: 0.14 mL/min/1.73m2/month [95% CI: 0.08 to 0.21]; p = 0.004) than patients receiving SOF-free DAAs. Multivariate analysis showed age per 1-year increase (adjusted slope coefficient difference: -0.05 mL/min/1.73m2/month [95% CI: -0.05 to -0.04]; p < 0.001), SOF-based DAAs (adjusted slope coefficient difference: -0.33 mL/min/1.73m2/month [95% CI: -0.49 to -0.17]; p < 0.001), and CKD stage (adjusted slope coefficient difference: -1.44 mL/min/1.73m2/month [95% CI: -1.58 to -1.30] and -3.59 mL/min/1.73m2/month [95% CI: -3.88 to -3.30] for stage 3 and stage 2 vs. stage 1; p < 0.001) were independent factors affecting eGFR evolution from baseline to SVR24. Patients receiving SOF-based DAAs have a quadratic trend with on-treatment worsening and off-therapy improving eGFR. Increasing age, SOF-based DAAs, and more advanced CKD stages are independently associated with eGFR decline in HCV patients receiving DAAs. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major health problem which affects 71 million people worldwide.1Patients with chronic HCV infection may present with various hepatic and extrahepatic manifestations that lead to substantial morbidity and mortality.2-5In contrast, the long-term health outcome improves following successful HCV eradication by antiviral therapies.6-8

Patients receiving SOF-based DAAs have a quadratic trend with on-treatment worsening and off-therapy improving eGFR. Increasing age, SOF-based DAAs, and more advanced CKD stages are independently associated with eGFR decline in HCV patients receiving DAAs. Owing to the excellent efficacy and safety as well as the short treatment duration, the use of interferon (IFN)-free direct acting antivirals (DAAs) has become the standard-of-care for managing HCV.9Sofosbuvir (SOF) is a pyrimidine nucleotide analogue which acts as the HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) chain terminator by inhibiting HCV non-structural protein 5B (NS5B) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase following intrahepatic activation to uridine triphosphate form.10Dephosphorylation results in the formation of inactive metabolite (GS-331007) that undergoes extensive renal excretion.Clinically, SOF is administered once-daily with pangenotypic potency and well tolerability, and has a high genetic barrier to viral resistance.Furthermore, SOF can be used in combination with NS3/4A protease inhibitors (PIs), NS5A inhibitors, and/or ribavirin (RBV) to achieve high sustained virologic response (SVR) rates.Therefore, applying SOF-based DAAs for HCV is welcome to most treating physicians.
Most cholesterol gallstones have a core consisting of inorganic and/or organic calcium salts, although the mechanisms of core formation are poorly understood. We examined whether the paracellular permeability of ions at hepatic tight junctions is involved in the core formation of cholesterol gallstones, with particular interest in the role of phosphate ion, a common food additive and preservative. We focused on claudin-3 (Cldn3), a paracellular barrier-forming tight junction protein whose expression in mouse liver decreases with age. Since Cldn3-knockout mice exhibited gallstone diseases, we used them to assess the causal relationship between paracellular phosphate ion permeability and the core formation of cholesterol gallstones. In the liver of Cldn3-knockout mice, the paracellular phosphate ion permeability through hepatic tight junctions was significantly increased, resulting in calcium phosphate core formation. Cholesterol overdose caused cholesterol gallstone disease in these mice. We revealed that in the hepatobiliary system, Cldn3 functions as a paracellular barrier for phosphate ions, to help maintain biliary ion homeostasis. We provide in vivo evidence that elevated phosphate ion concentrations play a major role in the lifestyle- and age-related risks of developing cholesterol gallstone disease under cholesterol overdose. Gallstone diseases have various symptoms, including pain and fever, and can lead to life-threatening conditions such as acute cholangitis, acute cholecystitis, biliary pancreatitis, and cancer of the biliary tract.1,2Given that gallstone diseases have a high incidence rate, are costly to treat surgically, and are responsible for lost work hours due to symptoms, preventing these diseases should have deep impacts on health and society.1

We provide in vivo evidence that elevated phosphate ion concentrations play a major role in the lifestyle- and age-related risks of developing cholesterol gallstone disease under cholesterol overdose. Gallstones are categorized into several types, including cholesterol, pigment, and phosphate gallstones, suggesting that there are different pathomechanisms for gallstone diseases.2–4Cholesterol gallstone disease has received a lot of attention because it has the highest prevalence, which is increasing.2In many cases, calcium and “calcium-sensitive” anions (phosphate, carbonate, stearate and/or palmitate) form the core of the cholesterol gallstone.4–6The pathomechanisms for cholesterol gallstone disease have been mostly studied with respect to changes in biliary lipids (cholesterol, bile acid, phospholipid, etc.) resulting from lipid overdose in the modern diet and from aging-associated dysfunctional lipid metabolism.7–13In contrast, the roles of ionic balance and its regulation in this process are unknown, although it is important to understand them, since some of these ions are used extensively as food additives and preservatives.14

The hepatobiliary system involves a balanced homeostasis of ions, water, and biliary lipids, which are regulated by transporters and channels on liver epithelial cells.15–17Epithelial tight junctions (TJs) function as a paracellular barrier for water, ions, and/or other small molecules.18,19The major protein component of TJs is claudin, a protein family with at least 27 members in mammals.20Claudin’s extracellular region plays essential roles in the paracellular barrier functions of TJs.21–23Hepatic TJs mainly consist of claudin-1, -2, -3, -12, and -25.24,25We previously reported that mice with knockout of claudin-2, a paracellular “channel-forming” claudin,26–30 develop cholesterol gallstone disease because of a decrease in paracellular water permeability.25,31However, the role of claudin-3 (Cldn3), which is the most highly expressed paracellular “barrier-forming” claudin in the liver and hepatobiliary system has remained unclear.Additionally, the mechanisms by which TJ dysfunction causes gallstone diseases are not well understood.In this respect, the hemizygous deletion of several genes including CLDN3 at 7q11.23 in Williams-Beuren syndrome32–34 and gallstone formation in a patient with Williams-Beuren syndrome have been reported.35
It remains controversial whether direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) accelerate the recurrence of hepatitis C-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative therapy. This study aimed to evaluate HCC recurrence after DAA treatment of chronic hepatitis C. We enrolled patients with a history of successful radiofrequency ablation treatment for hepatitis C-related HCC who received antiviral therapy with DAAs (DAA group: 147 patients) or with interferon (IFN)-based therapy (IFN group: 156 patients). We assessed HCC recurrence rates from the initiation of antiviral therapy using the Kaplan-Meier method and evaluated risk factors for HCC recurrence by multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. The recurrence pattern was categorized as follows: intrahepatic recurrence with a single tumor <2 cm (stage 0), a single tumor or up to 3 tumors ≤3 cm (stage A), multinodular (stage B), and extrahepatic metastasis or macrovascular invasion (stage C). The recurrence rates at 1 and 2 years were 39% and 61% in the IFN group and 39% and 60% in the DAA group, respectively (p = 0.43). Multivariate analysis identified higher lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of alpha-fetoprotein level, a history of multiple HCC treatments, and a shorter interval between HCC treatment and initiation of antiviral therapy as independent risk factors for HCC recurrence. HCC recurrence in stage 0, A, B, and C was found in 56 (41%), 60 (44%), 19 (14%), and 1 (0.7%) patients in the IFN group and 35 (44%), 32 (40%), 11 (14%), and 2 (2.5%) patients in the DAA group, respectively (p = 0.70). HCC recurrence rates and patterns after initiation of antiviral therapy did not differ between patients who received IFN-based therapy and DAA therapy. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and a leading cause of cancer-related death.1HCC usually develops in patients with chronic liver diseases, often related to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.2,3Although interferon (IFN)-based therapy after HCC treatment reportedly reduces the risk of HCC recurrence,4–6 few patients were eligible for IFN therapy after HCC treatment because of aging or advanced liver fibrosis, and its antiviral effect was inversely associated with the rates of adverse effects.7Currently, with the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), patients with a history of HCC can achieve a high sustained virologic response (SVR) rate with favorable tolerability.8,9

However, a high rate of early tumor recurrence has been reported in patients with a prior history of HCC treatment who were starting DAA treatment,10,11 for which we have presented counterevidence.12Briefly, a retrospective study compared the HCC recurrence rates between patients with a prior history of HCC treatment who underwent DAA therapy, IFN-based therapy, and non-antiviral therapy.DAA use did not increase the early HCC recurrence rate compared with that in the other 2 groups.In that study, the interval between initial HCC treatment and initiation of antiviral therapy was limited to 2 years, and patients with HCC recurrence before antiviral therapy were excluded.Thus, selected patients among those we saw in daily clinical practice were enrolled.
Treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) leads to hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA suppression in most patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), but HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) loss rates are low. Upon NA discontinuation, HBV DNA can return rapidly with ensuing alanine aminotransferase flares and induction of cytokines. Several studies reported higher HBsAg loss rates after stopping therapy, but at present it is unclear if cell-mediated immune responses are altered after treatment discontinuation. The aim of this study was to characterise T cell responses during the early phase of virological relapse, following discontinuation of NA therapy in HBeAg-negative patients. A total of 15 HBeAg-negative patients with CHB on long-term NA treatment were included in a prospective study and subjected to structured NA discontinuation. T cell responses were studied at the end of NA therapy and 4, 8 and 12 weeks thereafter. The T cell phenotype of patients with CHB on long-term NA therapy was markedly different compared to healthy individuals, but was only slightly altered after discontinuation of therapy. T cells from patients with HBsAg loss expressed low levels of KLRG1 and PD-1 at all time-points and high levels of Ki-67 and CD38 at week 12 after treatment cessation. In vitro peptide stimulated HBV-specific T cell responses were increased in several patients after NA cessation. Blocking of PD-L1 further enhanced HBV-specific T cell responses, especially after discontinuation of therapy. Relapse of active HBV replication after stopping therapy may trigger an immunological environment that enhances the responsiveness of HBV-specific T cells in vitro. Together with other immune interventions, this approach might be of interest for the development of novel therapeutic options to induce HBsAg loss in CHB. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronically infects around 250 million individuals worldwide and can cause liver cirrhosis as well as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).1The treatment options for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are either pegylated interferon-alfa (PEG-IFNα) or nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA).PEG-IFNα has the advantage of finite treatment with higher rates of anti-HBs seroconversion of around 10%, but is associated with considerable side effects.2Thus, well-tolerated NAs are most commonly used.NAs efficiently suppress viral replication in most patients, have a beneficial effect on disease progression, and reduce the risk of HCC development.2Still, NAs only have minor, if any, effect on covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA).For this reason, functional cure is a rare event and most patients with CHB require life-long therapy, particularly HBV e antigen (HBeAg)-negative patients.2

Together with other immune interventions, this approach might be of interest for the development of novel therapeutic options to induce HBsAg loss in CHB. To prevent life-long treatment, novel strategies to treat HBV infections are being evaluated.As such, discontinuation of NA therapy was proven to be safe in HBeAg-negative patients.It frequently leads to an early virological relapse but a fraction of patients experience functional cure.3–8For instance, a study by Hadziyannis and colleagues showed that 39% of HBeAg-negative patients cleared HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) during a 5.5-year follow-up after stopping long-term adefovir treatment.7Our group and a study by Berg et al. showed similar results with around 20% of the patients experiencing HBsAg loss.5,6As a consequence, stopping rules for well-selected HBeAg-negative patients were recently introduced into the new European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines for the treatment of HBV.2
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes chronic liver disease. Antivirals have been developed and cure infection. However, resistance can emerge and salvage therapies with alternative modes of action could be useful. Several licensed drugs have emerged as HCV entry inhibitors and are thus candidates for drug repurposing. We aimed to dissect their mode of action, identify improved derivatives and determine their viral targets. HCV entry inhibition was tested for a panel of structurally related compounds, using chimeric viruses representing diverse genotypes, in addition to viruses containing previously determined resistance mutations. Chemical modeling and synthesis identified improved derivatives, while generation of susceptible and non-susceptible chimeric viruses pinpointed E1 determinants of compound sensitivity. Molecules of the diphenylpiperazine, diphenylpiperidine, phenothiazine, thioxanthene, and cycloheptenepiperidine chemotypes inhibit HCV infection by interfering with membrane fusion. These molecules and a novel p-methoxy-flunarizine derivative with improved efficacy preferentially inhibit genotype 2 viral strains. Viral residues within a central hydrophobic region of E1 (residues 290–312) control susceptibility. At the same time, viral features in this region also govern pH-dependence of viral membrane fusion. Small molecules from different chemotypes related to flunarizine preferentially inhibit HCV genotype 2 membrane fusion. A hydrophobic region proximal to the putative fusion loop controls sensitivity to these drugs and the pH range of membrane fusion. An algorithm considering viral features in this region predicts viral sensitivity to membrane fusion inhibitors. Resistance to flunarizine correlates with more relaxed pH requirements for fusion. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a highly variable, enveloped virus of the family Flaviviridae.According to sequence analyses, viral isolates are classified into 7 genotypes and 86 subtypes.1HCV particles harbor a plus-strand RNA genome of positive polarity that encodes a polyprotein comprising structural proteins, the p7 ion channel and various non-structural proteins.Virus particles are composed of the core protein that encases the viral RNA, and of the envelope 1 and envelope 2 (E1-E2) glycoproteins, which are embedded in the viral lipid membrane.Virion-associated E1-E2 glycoproteins coordinate interactions with cellular receptors, cell uptake and membrane fusion which is triggered by the low pH in cellular endosomes.

If left untreated, chronic infection by HCV can cause severe liver disease including liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.Approximately 71 million individuals are chronically infected and at risk of developing disease.The licensing of multiple classes of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has in recent years revolutionized antiviral treatment.These drugs either target the viral NS3 protease, the NS5A phosphoprotein or the NS5B polymerase.Combination therapies involving these drugs are active against viruses from genotype 1 to 6 and reach cure rates of greater than 95%.2

Resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) have been observed for all classes of DAAs and associated with treatment failure.3,4Although viral resistance and treatment failure occur infrequently, due to the relative short history of these new treatments it is difficult to predict to which level salvage therapies including novel drug classes will be required in the future.

Cell entry inhibitors comprise part of HIV-1 combination therapies,5 and are in clinical development for treatment of hepatitis B and hepatitis delta virus infections.6Cell entry inhibitors which either target viral components or cellular factors have also emerged as an interesting class of inhibitors in HCV.7Pre-clinical studies have confirmed their efficacy in vitro and in vivo and have shown that combined with DAAs they prevent breakthrough of antiviral-resistant HCV.8In the course of several independent screening campaigns involving various compound libraries, including for instance the NIH clinical compound (NCC) collection or the library of pharmacologically active compounds (LOPAC1280), a number of HCV entry inhibitors were discovered.9These HCV entry inhibitors have diverse but related chemical scaffolds including molecules from the group of diphenylpiperazines, diphenylpiperidines, phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and cycloheptenepiperidines (Fig. 1A).This group includes licensed drugs with neuroleptic (flunarizine) or anti-histamine (chlorcyclizine) activity.10,11Antiviral activity in the nanomolar range and proven in vivo efficacy render some of these compounds attractive candidates for further development as HCV entry inhibitors.However, it remains unclear if these diverse compounds share their mode of action, if they target a common viral site, and which virus strains and protein(s) are susceptible to these types of inhibitors.
Since iPSC human develop into hepatic organoids through stages that resemble human embryonic liver development, they can be used to study developmental processes and disease pathology. Therefore, we examined the early stages of hepatic organoid formation to identify key pathways affecting early liver development. Single cell RNA-sequencing and metabolomic analysis was performed on developing organoid cultures at the iPSC, hepatoblast (day 9) and mature organoid stage. The importance of the phosphatidyl-ethanolamine biosynthesis pathway to early liver development was examined in developing organoid cultures using iPSC with a CRISPR-mediated gene knockout and an over the counter medication (meclizine) that inhibits the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway. Meclizine’s effect on the growth of a human hepatocarcinoma cell line in a xenotransplantation model and on the growth of acute myeloid leukemia cells in vitro was also examined. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis of organoid development indicated that the phosphatidyl-ethanolamine biosynthesis pathway is essential for early liver development. Unexpectedly, early hepatoblasts were selectively sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of meclizine. We demonstrate that meclizine could be repurposed for use in a new synergistic combination therapy for primary liver cancer: a glycolysis inhibitor reprograms cancer cell metabolism to make it susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of meclizine. This combination inhibited the growth of a human liver carcinoma cell line in vitro; and in a xenotransplantation model without causing significant side effets. This drug combination was also highly active against acute myeloid leukemic cells. Our data indicates that the phosphatidyl-ethanolamine biosynthesis is a targetable pathway for cancer; and that meclizine may have clinical efficacy as a repurposed anti-cancer drug when used as part of a new combination therapy. Organoids have provided a very powerful model system for analyzing organogenesis and disease pathophysiology (1, 2).We recently developed a novel method to direct the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into 3-dimensional human hepatic organoids (HOs), which consist of sheets of hepatocytes, and cholangiocytes that are organized into epithelia that surround the lumina of duct-like structures.The HOs have biosynthetic, and functional capabilities of human liver; and HOs with engineered mutations provide a unique model for studying human disease-causing genetic mutations (3).In response to changes in the growth factors added to the media, HOs develop through stages that resemble human liver during embryonic development.Because of these properties, HOs could be used to identify pathways regulating discrete stages in liver development and disease pathogenesis.
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an effective treatment for single hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ≤3 cm. Disease recurrence is common, and in some patients will occur outside transplant criteria. We aimed to assess the incidence and risk factors for recurrence beyond Milan criteria in potentially transplantable patients treated with RFA as first-line therapy. We performed a retrospective cohort study of potentially transplantable patients with new diagnoses of unifocal HCC ≤3 cm that underwent RFA as first-line therapy between 2000-2015. We defined potentially transplantable patients as those aged <70 years without any comorbidities that would preclude transplant surgery. Incidence of recurrence beyond Milan criteria was compared across 2 groups according to HCC diameter at the time of ablation: (HCC ≤2 cm vs. HCC >2 cm). Competing risks Cox regression was used to identify predictors of recurrence beyond Milan criteria. We included 301 patients (167 HCC ≤2 cm and 134 HCC >2 cm). Recurrence beyond Milan criteria occurred in 36 (21.6%) and 47 (35.1%) patients in the HCC ≤2 cm and the HCC >2 cm groups, respectively (p = 0.01). The 1-, 3- and 5-year actuarial survival rates after RFA were 98.2%, 86.2% and 79.0% in the HCC ≤2 cm group vs. 93.3%, 77.6% and 70.9% in the HCC >2 cm group (p = 0.01). Tumor size >2 cm (hazard ratio 1.94; 95% CI 1.25–3.02) and alpha-fetoprotein levels at the time of ablation (100–1,000 ng/ml: hazard ratio 2.05; 95% CI 1.10–3.83) were found to be predictors of post-RFA recurrence outside Milan criteria. RFA for single HCC ≤3 cm provides excellent short- to medium-term survival. However, we identified patients at higher risk of recurrence beyond Milan criteria. For these patients, liver transplantation should be considered immediately after the first HCC recurrence following RFA. The optimal approach for transplantable patients with early unifocal HCC is unclear.Small HCC (BCLC-0 or A) can be treated with ablation, liver resection, or liver transplantation (LT) as first-line therapies.1Although the results of LT are excellent, most jurisdictions currently only assign model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) exception points to patients with larger HCC based on the belief that if resection or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) do not work, transplantation can be undertaken as a second curative procedure.2
Patients with decompensated cirrhosis on the waiting list for liver transplantation (LT) commonly develop complications that may preclude them from reaching LT. Circulatory dysfunction leading to effective arterial hypovolemia and activation of vasoconstrictor systems is a key factor in the pathophysiology of complications of cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether treatment with midodrine, an alpha-adrenergic vasoconstrictor, together with intravenous albumin improves circulatory dysfunction and prevents complications of cirrhosis in patients awaiting LT. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT00839358) was conducted, including 196 consecutive patients with cirrhosis and ascites awaiting LT. Patients were randomly assigned to receive midodrine (15–30 mg/day) and albumin (40 g/15 days) or matching placebos for one year, until LT or drop-off from inclusion on the waiting list. The primary endpoint was incidence of any complication (renal failure, hyponatremia, infections, hepatic encephalopathy or gastrointestinal bleeding). Secondary endpoints were mortality, activity of endogenous vasoconstrictor systems and plasma cytokine levels. There were no significant differences between both groups in the probability of developing complications of cirrhosis during follow-up (p = 0.402) or one-year mortality (p = 0.527). Treatment with midodrine and albumin was associated with a slight but significant decrease in plasma renin activity and aldosterone compared to placebo (renin −4.3 vs. 0.1 ng/ml.h, p < 0.001; aldosterone −38 vs. 6 ng/dl, p = 0.02, at week 48 vs. baseline). Plasma norepinephrine only decreased slightly at week 4. Neither arterial pressure nor plasma cytokine levels changed significantly. In patients with cirrhosis awaiting LT, treatment with midodrine and albumin, at the doses used in this study, slightly suppressed the activity of vasoconstrictor systems, but did not prevent complications of cirrhosis or improve survival. The natural history of decompensated cirrhosis is characterized by the development of recurrent complications of the disease, leading to frequent hospital admissions, impaired quality of life and increased mortality.1–5Liver transplantation (LT) is the definitive treatment for patients with end-stage liver disease.Patients with decompensated cirrhosis achieve good outcomes after LT with three-year survival above 80%.5–8However, one of the major concerns is the development of complications while on the waiting list, which may be a cause of death or may delay or preclude patients with decompensated cirrhosis from receiving LT.9–12

In patients with cirrhosis awaiting LT, treatment with midodrine and albumin, at the doses used in this study, slightly suppressed the activity of vasoconstrictor systems, but did not prevent complications of cirrhosis or improve survival. Some strategies have proved to be useful in preventing specific complications of cirrhosis, such as beta-blockers for prevention of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, antibiotic prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or addition of rifaximin to lactulose treatment for recurrent hepatic encephalopathy (HE).6,13–15Nevertheless, these approaches cannot completely prevent the development of these complications, and there are no strategies available to prevent other frequent complications, such as bacterial infections other than SBP, ascites, acute kidney injury or hyponatremia.Therefore, there is an unmet need for effective strategies to prevent the development of complications in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, particularly those on the waiting list for LT, in order to improve outcomes and increase the probability of patients receiving LT.

In patients with cirrhosis awaiting LT, treatment with midodrine and albumin, at the doses used in this study, slightly suppressed the activity of vasoconstrictor systems, but did not prevent complications of cirrhosis or improve survival. The common hallmark in the pathophysiology of complications of advanced cirrhosis is circulatory dysfunction, characterized by effective arterial hypovolemia.The reduction in effective arterial blood volume leads to the activation of endogenous vasoconstrictor systems (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, sympathetic nervous system, vasopressin) that are responsible for some of the major complications of cirrhosis.16–18Based on this pathophysiological basis, targeting circulatory dysfunction appears to be a promising therapeutic approach to decrease the development of complications.

Vasoconstrictors and albumin have been shown to be useful to improve circulatory function in patients with advanced cirrhosis and, the combination of both drugs is currently the standard of care for the management of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).6,18–22There is large amount of evidence showing that albumin is effective in preventing circulatory dysfunction following large-volume paracentesis, HRS in the setting of SBP and for the management of type 1 HRS.6,18,20–24There is data showing that the administration of albumin together with diuretics for one year in patients after their first episode of ascites was associated with significantly improved survival;25 but information on the potential benefits of long-term albumin administration is scarce.Besides its oncotic properties, albumin has properties that could also be useful for the prevention of complications of cirrhosis, including antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects, as well as a possible positive impact on endothelial function.26Midodrine is an alpha-1 agonist that has been shown to improve circulatory and kidney function in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.27–29Compared to other vasoconstrictors, midodrine has the advantage that is active orally and, therefore, could be easily used in a long-term strategy.Three randomized pilot studies, in small patient samples, have been reported assessing the effects of midodrine in patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites.30–32These studies showed that the administration of midodrine was associated with an improvement of systemic hemodynamics and better control of ascites; however, they failed to demonstrate improvement of other complications of cirrhosis.Despite the scarcity of randomized clinical trials, midodrine is currently used in daily clinical practice in patients with cirrhosis in many countries.In fact, a survey that we performed in 2017 among members of the International Club of Ascites (ICA), showed that out of the 83 members that answered the survey, 49% frequently used midodrine for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis; and this percentage increased to 86% if only physicians from North America were considered (E. Solà, unpublished).The situations in which midodrine is mainly used are HRS, refractory ascites and arterial hypotension.
Acetaminophen (APAP) induced hepatotoxicity is a leading cause of acute liver failure worldwide. It is well established that the liver damage induced by acetaminophen exhibits diurnal variation. However, the detailed mechanism for the hepatotoxic variation is not clear. Herein, we aimed to determine the relative contributions of gut microbiota in modulating the diurnal variation of hepatotoxicity induced by APAP. Male Balb/C mice were treated with or without antibiotics and a single dose of orally administered APAP (300 mg/kg) at ZT0 (when the light is on-start of resting period) and ZT12 (when the light is off-start of active period). In agreement with previous findings, hepatic injury was markedly enhanced at ZT12 compared with ZT0. Interestingly, upon antibiotic treatment, ZT12 displayed a protective effect against APAP hepatotoxicity similar to ZT0. Moreover, mice that received the cecal content from ZT12 showed more severe liver damage than mice that received the cecal content from ZT0. 16S sequencing data revealed significant differences in the cecal content between ZT0 and ZT12 in the compositional level. Furthermore, metabolomic analysis showed that the gut microbial metabolites were also different between ZT0 and ZT12. Specifically, the level of 1-phenyl-1,2-propanedione (PPD) was significantly higher at ZT12 than ZT0. Treatment with PPD alone did not cause obvious liver damage. However, PPD synergistically enhanced APAP-induced hepatic injury in vivo and in vitro. Finally, we found Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which could reduce intestinal PPD levels, was able to markedly alleviate APAP-induced liver damage at ZT12. The gut microbial metabolite PPD was responsible, at least in part, for the diurnal variation of hepatotoxicity induced by APAP by decreasing glutathione levels. Acetaminophen (APAP) is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic drug.1,2However, severe hepatotoxicity resulting from excessive doses is the leading cause for acute liver failure (ALF) in the Western world.3,4APAP is absorbed from the intestine and processed by liver.5When taken at a low dose, APAP is mainly eliminated by sulfation and glucuronidation, with the toxicity pathway making only a small contribution and mainly detoxified by glutathione (GSH).6–8With elevation of APAP concentration in hepatocytes, a greater portion of APAP can be metabolized into N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) by cytochrome P450s, mainly by CYP2E1.9,10NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with hepatic GSH.However, if GSH is exhausted, the generated reactive metabolite accumulates and exerts toxic effects initiated by covalent binding to macromolecules.This causes mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately leading to hepatocyte necrosis and ALF.11–13
