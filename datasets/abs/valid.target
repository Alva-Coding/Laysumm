Childhood epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures (EMAS) is a rare form of epilepsy associated with drop seizures at a young age. It often resolves permanently. This case report describes 3 boys who appeared to have typical EMAS, but then surprisingly developed absence type seizures during early adolescence. In all three cases, the seizures came under control again.
Rasmussen syndrome (RS) is a chronic progressive encephalopathy with unihemispheric involvement, clinically featured by intractable focal seizures, epilepsia partialis continua, hemiparesis, and cognitive decline. Despite immune-mediated pathogenesis, the only definitive treatment for RS is represented by functional hemispherectomy. We describe the case of a 6.5-year-old female patient diagnosed with RS, who was firstly treated with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin and antiseizure therapy, showing an incomplete response. Finally, the patient received therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), obtaining a good clinical response, demonstrated by the reduction of the seizure episodes, and the stability of the radiological findings.
Extracting and tracking hot topics helps us better understand the latest public opinions and pay attention to their evolution. To extract topics from microblog posts accurately, the five unique features of micro-blogs drive the joint probability distributions of all words and topics, and improve LDA into a novel topic extraction model. To track the evolution trend of the topic, a hot topic life cycle model is divided to five stages: birth, growth, maturity, decline, and disappearance. A hot topic tracking algorithm which integrates MF-LDA and HTLCM is developed.
This paper proposed a new metric to address the profit bias in the stock market prediction. Previous studies mainly focused on proposing effective approaches to make profits. However, there is an ineffectiveness in model evaluation due to the inconsistency between a model's performance and profitability. In order to address the profit bias in model evaluation, we propose a new effective metric, Mean Profit Rate (MPR). The using of MPR enable evaluating models profit-bias free.
With success in clinical trials for treatment of rare forms childhood epilepsy (Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome), cannabidiol has emerged as an exciting new addition to the physician’s toolbox. Cannabidiol may also be effective in the treatment of other forms of epilepsy. We present a case of extraordinarily severe seizures (super-refractory status epilepticus) in a 12-year-old girl, in which seizures resolved soon after the introduction of pure pharmaceutical cannabidiol. Although this report does not establish definitive proof of effectiveness, this case provides a blueprint for future study.
This study investigates the use of strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) to identify the movement of people and role of population diversity in 10th-13th century culture change in the North American midcontinent. Tooth enamel from small animals from across the midcontinent provide baseline regional 87Sr/86Sr information. Results show significant isotopic differences between some locations that enable identification of non-local individuals; however, considerable isotopic similarity within the midcontinent highlights the limitations of 87Sr/86Sr in determining place of origin. Isotopic analysis, when combined with other geochemical, biological, and archaeological data, can contribute to our understanding of the movement of people in pre-Columbian America.
In the USA, Cannabidiol oil (CBD) is in use as an adjunctive treatment for epilepsy in Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndrome patients. With legalization of medical and recreational marijuana in many states, patients with epilepsy may self-determine therapy with cannabis (SDTC) to treat their seizures. We present two patients, both died suddenly, both used SDTC in substitution for conventional anti seizure medications. Many providers may not be aware of SDTC risks, further study of morbidity and mortality of SDTC in patients with epilepsy is needed.
The reconstruction of body size is useful for investigating temporal variation in the size of the Australian dingo (Canis dingo), particularly in the context of human activity. In the Canidae, numerous methods to reconstruct body mass have been proposed, however there is no one-size fits all approach. Current methods are also often complex and have relatively high error rates. Here, we present a regression equation to estimate body mass of the dingo based on two simple measurements of the hard palate, whilst ensuring that it could be used with incomplete skeletal material, and in studies of encephalisation.
This paper presents timbers study in the Faravel polymetallic district (Upper Durance valley, Southern French Alps). The dendrochronological study of well-preserved timbers from small-size opencast mines gave up accurate tree felling dates with seasonal resolution. The chronological distribution of these felling dates highlights nine distinct mining phases that occurred between 1059 and 1243 AD. Associated with archaeological observations and radiocarbon analyses, this chronology evidenced short, seasonal and low-intensity mining campaigns, mainly carried out after the bulk of agropastoral activities. Miners used rudimentary techniques based on the systematic reused of wood materials, which had limited impact on forest cover.
Recent archaeological investigations (2009-2016) in Sistema 7 Venado, a ceremonial group located on the south part of Monte Albán, Oaxaca, Mexico, demonstrates that occupation and ceremonial activity on the site can be traced back until 800 BCE. Around 200-300 CE, the complex is ritually abandoned, but, during about a thousand years of occupation, pre-Hispanic people have used hundreds chipped tools and weapons from different varieties of obsidian. To discover the obsidian sources used at 7 Venado, 416 of these artefacts were analysed by PIXE technique. The results led us to twelve Mexican sources and revealed variations of supply areas through time.
Just as normal objects, data also may have shapes. Think about a flock of birds where each bird is placed at a specific position in the sky but the flock as a whole may have a distinct shape. And analogously, individual data points also have a position (in an abstract mathematical space) and form different shapes as a whole. Data from production plants have very complex shapes and in this paper a new method has been developed which identifies these shapes. Once this shapes have been computed, it is easy to identify not-normal data points, i.e. error situations.
In 1928, archaeologist Dorothy Garrod and her team excavated Zarzi cave in Iraq. This cave was occupied by modern humans during the Epipalaeolithic, a period between the last Ice Age and the warm conditions of the Holocene. Among the finds from the cave were two small obsidian artifacts. Obsidian, however, does not naturally occur in Iraq. Instead, this volcanic glass must have been transported to the cave site by people. Chemical analysis of these two artifacts, both small blades, reveals that the obsidian originated from Nemrut Dağ volcano in what is now eastern Turkey, more than 650 km on foot.
In our real-life related decision-making problems, two dimensional neutrosophic information of an alternative with respect to a parameter is often appeared. Complex neutrosophic soft set theory can handle these problems very easily by using its amplitude part and phase part. Therefore, in this study, we have proposed a decision-making methodology to solve problems based on complex fuzzy soft sets by using VIKOR method. Three real-life related problems including, medical diagnosis problem, sustainable manufacturing material selection problem, company's manager selection problem have been discussed and solved to show the aptness of our developed approach.
Cannabidiol (CBD) improves seizure frequency and severity in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy, but its effects on brain structure are poorly understood. Cannabis-induced neurotoxicity is thought to be mediated by Δ9-tetrahydrocannabidiol (THC). However, whether a pharmaceutical-grade CBD isolate with less than 0.3% THC contributes to such effects has not been investigated to date. We obtained imaging before and after 10-12 weeks of treatment with CBD and quantified structural brain changes with voxel- and surface-based morphometry. This preliminary study is the first to document that CBD does not significantly change grey matter volume or cortical thickness, despite improvements in seizure control.
Beads were an important form of personal ornamentation in Pre-Pottery Neolithic societies in the Levant. Symbolic practices and exchange networks practiced by these communities can be revealed by establishing the mineralogical composition of stone beads and the methods used to manufacture the beads. Here, we apply XRD and 3D digital optical microscopy to investigate raw material selection and bead manufacture from two distinct time periods at the Pre-Pottery Neolithic settlement of el-Hemmeh, Jordan. We reveal changes in color selection, material choice, and production methods across the two time periods, linking them to broader cultural shifts.
This paper presents the results of a geochemical study conducted on pottery from a site in the Rub’ al-Khali desert in the United Arab Emirates. This site is unusual in that there is no evidence of permanent architecture. It appears to have been inhabited episodically, with people continuously returning to the site from around 2000 BCE to 800 BCE and then less regularly from 800 BCE up to the recent past. The compositional analysis of the pottery found that the people gathering at this site were integrated into the larger regional economy.
In safety risk assessment problems, multi-expert and multi-criterion are often involved and assessment data are often given in form of interval number (IN). To incorporate risk attitudes into assessment, we propose the definition of interval number with distribution function and utility function. The frequency and consequence are only two needed indicators in risk matrix and their values are needed in form of crisp value. So the semi-quantitative safety risk assessment in oil and gas industry is a multi-expert and multi-criterion based on interval number (MEMC-IN) information fusion problem. A MEMCIF-IN model is proposed to solve this problem in our paper.
The Jomon vessels that have impressions of maize weevils dated between ca. 5000 and 4000 years BP have been discovered in southern Hokkaido, Japan. One of them has more than 500 adult weevils that were mixed into clay. The geographical and temporal distribution of these vessels suggests a possibility of the human-mediated diffusion of maize weevils and chestnut cultivation across oceanic barriers by the Jomon people lived in the northern Tohoku region, because chestnut tree had not been native to Hokkaido before that time originally.
The prognosis for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma is poor, partly because of the lack of effective treatment options for those with more advanced disease. In this study, we identified a subpopulation of cancer cells with stem cell-like properties that were critical for tumor maintenance and growth in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma. Through further experiments, we demonstrated that the Jak/Stat pathway is a promising therapeutic target in hepatocellular carcinoma.
Glycogen synthase kinase 3β promotes macrophage inflammatory activation by inhibiting the immune regulatory signalling of AMP-activated protein kinase and the induction of small heterodimer partner. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of glycogen synthase kinase 3β enhances innate immune regulation and protects liver from ischaemia and reperfusion injury.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an inflammatory liver disease which often progresses to liver failure. The cause of the disease is unclear and therapeutic options are limited. Therefore, we explored the role of white blood cells termed macrophages in PSC given their frequent contribution to other human inflammatory diseases. Our results implicate macrophages in PSC and PSC-like diseases in mice. More importantly, we found that pharmacologic inhibition of macrophage recruitment to the liver reduces PSC-like liver injury in the mouse. These exciting observations highlight potential new strategies to treat PSC.
New oral antivirals can cure chronic hepatitis C infection, however patients with advanced chronic liver disease are still at risk of presenting with liver-related complications. The most frequent complication after oral antiviral therapy in asymptomatic patients with advanced chronic liver disease was liver cancer. The use of simple parameters such liver stiffness and albumin levels after treatment can help to identify patients at higher or lower risk of liver cancer.
Patients with hepatitis C virus infection who are on opioid agonist therapy can achieve high cure rates with current treatments. The use of illicit drugs during treatment can drive drop-outs and reduce cure rates. However, hepatitis C can be cured in most of those using drugs who complete treatment and follow-up.
While the efficacy of sofosbuvir for the treatment of hepatitis C virus is clear, data regarding its possible nephrotoxicity are controversial. Herein, we showed that sofosbuvir worsened on-treatment kidney function but led to an off-treatment improvement. Our findings suggest that treating physicians should be alert to risk factors for kidney dysfunction before initiating direct-acting antiviral treatment for patients with hepatitis C virus infection.
As the main cause of death in critically ill patients, sepsis remains a major health issue lacking efficacious therapies. While current clinical literature suggests an important role for inflammation, metabolic aspects of sepsis have mostly been overlooked. Here, we show that mice with an impaired metabolic response, due to deficiency of the nuclear receptor PPARα in the liver, exhibit enhanced mortality upon bacterial infection despite a similar inflammatory response, suggesting that metabolic interventions may be a viable strategy for improving sepsis outcomes.
Obeticholic acid increased human gallbladder cholesterol saturation and bile acid hydrophobicity, both decreasing cholesterol solubility in bile. Together with increased hepatobiliary levels of fibroblast growth factor 19, our findings suggest that pharmacological activation of the farnesoid X receptor increases the risk of gallstone formation.
Chronicity is a serious threat to infants infected with hepatitis B. However, no treatment measure has been recommended for infantile-onset hepatitis B in current guidelines. In order to evaluate the benefit and safety of antiviral therapy in infantile-onset hepatitis B, a real-world cohort study was conducted. Long-term follow-up results showed that early initiation of antiviral therapy with lamivudine safely led to a rapid and significant loss of serum hepatitis B surface antigen in the present subset of infants with alanine aminotransferase ≥2× upper limit of normal. Further trials with larger cohorts are needed.
Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), which develops in patients with cirrhosis, is characterized by intense systemic inflammation and organ failure(s). Because systemic inflammation is energetically expensive, its metabolic costs may result in organ dysfunction/failure. We identified a 38-metabolite blood fingerprint specific for ACLF that revealed mitochondrial dysfunction in peripheral organs. This may contribute to organ failures.
In a pan-European study of 467,336 men and women, we found that physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of developing liver cancers over the next decade. This risk was independent of other liver cancer risk factors, and did not vary by age, gender, smoking status, body weight, and alcohol consumption.
Alcoholics with an ALDH2 polymorphism have an increased risk of digestive tract cancer development, however, the link between ALDH2 deficiency and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development has not been well established. In this study, we show that ALDH2 deficiency exacerbates alcohol-associated HCC development both in patients and mouse models. Mechanistic studies revealed that after chronic alcohol exposure, Aldh2-deficient hepatocytes produce a large amount of harmful oxidized mitochondrial DNA via extracellular vesicles, which can be delivered into neighboring HCC cells and subsequently activate multiple oncogenic pathways, promoting HCC.
TNF-α producing cells are the dominant population of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific CD4 T cells in patients with chronic HBV infection. This population of cells might contribute to the aggravation of liver damage in patients with a hepatitis B flare. HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells are associated with HBV viral clearance. Differentiation from HBV-specific TNF-α producing CD4 T cells into HBV-specific IFN-γ producing CD4 T cells might favor HBV viral clearance.
In patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, participation in structured lifestyle programs may be jeopardized by job and time constraints. A web-based intervention may be better suited for young, busy patients, and for those living far from liver units. The study shows that, following a structured motivational approach, a web-based, interactive intervention coupled with six-month face-to-face meetings is not inferior to a standard group-based intervention with respect to weight loss, adherence to healthy diet and habitual physical activity, normalization of liver enzymes, and stable surrogate markers of fibrosis.
Gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is an imaging technique with a high sensitivity for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, arterial-phase images may be unsatisfactory because of weak arterial enhancement. We found that using arterial subtraction images led to clinically meaningful improvements in the diagnosis of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma.
There is a high burden of hepatitis C infection among prisoners worldwide. Prisoners who continue to inject drugs are also at risk of developing new infections. For this reason, the prison setting provides an opportunity to treat those people at greatest risk of infection and to stop transmission to others. We developed a new method of providing hepatitis C treatment to prisoners, in which nurses rather than doctors assessed prisoners locally at each prison site. Treatment was safe and most prisoners were cured. Such programs will contribute greatly to achieving the World Health Organization’s hepatitis C elimination goals.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has become one of the most feared chronic liver diseases, because it is the most rapidly growing indication for adult liver transplantation and a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the mechanisms involved in the transformation of simple steatosis to steatohepatitis remain unclear. Herein, we show that gasdermin D driven pyroptosis is prominent in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and gasdermin-N domain remains a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of NASH. Gasdermin D plays a key role in the pathogenesis of NASH by regulating lipogenesis, the inflammatory response, and the NF-ĸB signaling pathway, revealing potential treatment targets for NASH in humans.
Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for hepatitis C is highly effective and well tolerated. The SMART-C randomised trial evaluated an 8-week regimen of glecaprevir-pibrentasvir for hepatitis C treatment, using a simplified monitoring schedule that included no pathology tests or clinic visits during treatment. This simplified strategy produced a high cure rate (92%), but this was not equivalent to the standard monitoring schedule cure rate (95%).
We here analyzed genomic features of 412 BTC samples from Japanese and Italian populations. A total of 32 significantly and commonly mutated genes were identified, some of which negatively affected patient prognosis, including a novel deletion of MUC17 at 7q22.1. Cell-of-origin predictions using WGS and epigenetic features suggest hepatocyte-origin of hepatitis-related ICCs. Deleterious germline mutations of cancer-predisposing genes were detected in 11% of patients with BTC. BTCs have distinct genetic features including somatic events and germline predisposition.
Liver endothelial cells are the first liver cell type affected after any kind of liver injury. The loss of their unique phenotype during injury amplifies liver damage by orchestrating the response of the liver microenvironment. Autophagy is a mechanism involved in the regulation of this initial response and its manipulation can modify the progression of liver damage.
Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health problem worldwide. The clearance of HBV relies largely on an effective T cell immune response, which usually becomes dysregulated in chronic HBV infection. Our study provides a new mechanism to elucidate HBV persistence and a new target for developing immunotherapy strategies in patients chronically infected with HBV.
Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic liver disease caused by a dysfunctional immune system. It is widely believed that autoimmune hepatitis accumulates in families. We studied the family members of patients with autoimmune hepatitis from the entire Danish population. We found that autoimmune hepatitis does accumulate in families, but the risk of autoimmune hepatitis in the family members is very low.
We report a unique experience with 50 living donors who volunteered to donate to a recipient with whom they had no biological connection or prior relationship (anonymous living donors). This report is the first to discuss motivations, strategies and facilitators that may mitigate physical, social and ethical risk factors in this patient population. With rigorous protocols, anonymous liver donation and recipient outcomes are excellent; with appropriate clinical expertise and system facilitators in place, our experience suggests that other centers may consider the procedure for its significant potential to reduce the gap between transplant organ demand and availability.
Herein, we established a system to generate human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived functional hepatobiliary organoids in vitro, without any exogenous cells or genetic manipulation. To some extent this model was able to recapitulate several key aspects of hepatobiliary organogenesis in a parallel fashion, holding great promise for drug development and liver transplantation.
Liver cancer stem cells harbor high tumor-initiating potential and confer resistance to typical therapies, but the mechanism underlying their self-renewal remains elusive. LncHDAC2 augments the self-renewal of these cells, promoting tumor propagation. In liver cancer stem cells, lncHDAC2 activates Hedgehog signaling to initiate liver tumorigenesis. Therefore, lncHDAC2 and the Hedgehog signaling pathway may serve as biomarkers and potential drug targets for hepatocellular carcinoma.
Relapse of hepatitis B virus replication after discontinuation of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy in certain patients with chronic hepatitis B may alter the phenotype of T cells and enhance the responsiveness of hepatitis B virus-specific T cells to in vitro peptide stimulation. Blocking PD-L1 can further augment these hepatitis B virus-specific T cell responses. Interestingly, T cells of patients that subsequently achieve hepatitis B surface antigen loss are less exhausted at all time-points after stopping treatment and display a higher proliferative capacity 12-weeks after treatment discontinuation. These findings contribute to the understanding of the immunological events that occur during discontinuation of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy.
Acetaminophen poisoning is one of the most common causes of liver injury. This study examined a new biomarker of acetaminophen toxicity, which measures the amount of toxic metabolite exposure called acetaminophen-protein adduct. We found that those who developed liver injury had a higher initial level of acetaminophen-protein adducts than those who did not.
Alcoholic cirrhosis creates a large public health burden and is a risk factor for bone fractures. Based on data from England and Denmark, we found that hip fractures occur more than five times more frequently in people with alcoholic cirrhosis than in people without the disease. Additionally, the aftermath of the hip fracture is severe, such that up to 11% of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis die within 30 days after their hip fracture. These results suggest that efforts directed towards fracture prevention in people with alcoholic cirrhosis could be beneficial.
At week 96 of two ongoing studies comparing the efficacy and safety of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B patients, TAF continues to be as effective as TDF with continued improved renal and bone safety
During chronic liver disease, while native hepatocytes are exhausted and genetically unstable, a subset of cholangiocytes clonally expand to differentiate into young, functional and robust hepatocytes. This cholangiocyte cell population is a promising target for regenerative therapies in patients with chronic liver insufficiency.
Immunotherapy for metastatic cancer can be complicated by immune-related adverse events in the liver. In patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic cancer who develop immune-mediated hepatitis, liver biopsy is helpful for the diagnosis and evaluation of the severity of liver injury. This study demonstrates the need for patient-oriented management, which could eventually avoid unnecessary systemic corticosteroid treatment.
Previously, infections with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus led to poor outcomes in kidney transplant recipients. However, the outcomes of kidney transplants in patients with viral suppression are as good as those for kidney transplants in non-infected patients. Antiviral therapy should be systematically proposed to hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C-infected kidney transplant recipients or candidates to prevent the deleterious hepatic and extrahepatic impact of chronic viral replication. Recent access to direct-acting antivirals in patients with hepatitis C virus and renal dysfunction provides exciting new opportunities.
Herein, we report that therapeutic inhibition of a cell receptor expressed by bile duct cancer cells resulted in the loss of a critical survival protein termed MCL1. Cellular depletion of MCL1 resulted in the death of the cancer cells by a process characterised by cell rupture. Cell death by this process can stimulate the immune system and has implications for combination therapy using receptor inhibition with immunotherapy
Chimeric animals are composed of cells from different species. Chimeric animals carrying human tissue have the potential to increase the availability of transplantable organs. We transplanted rat-to-mouse liver grafts into newly weaned rats. The chimeric grafts underwent post-transplant remodelling with rat hepatocytes replacing all mouse hepatocytes within 56 days. In addition, we observed the post-transplant development of diffuse mature rat bile ducts through the transformation of hepatocytes, and patchy areas of portal endothelium originating from the host. These data demonstrate the efficacy of transplanting rat-to-mouse chimeric livers into rats, with a high potential for post-transplant graft remodelling.
Liver biopsy is a potentially painful and risky method to assess damage to the liver due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We analyzed data from a clinical trial to determine if 2 methods of magnetic resonance imaging – 1 to measure liver fat and 1 to measure liver fibrosis (scarring) – could potentially replace liver biopsy in evaluating NASH-related liver injury. Both imaging methods were correlated with biopsy in showing the effects of NASH on the liver.
A mouse model combining chronic liver injury, acute hepatic insult, and bacterial infection recapitulates some of the key features of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) in patients. Both fibrosis and bacterial infection contribute to the impaired regenerative capacity of the liver in patients with ACLF. Herein, we show that IL-22Fc therapy improves ACLF by reprogramming impaired regenerative pathways and attenuating bacterial infection. Thus, it may have therapeutic potential for patients with ACLF.
Disease severity in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is associated with a significant presence of neutrophils (a type of immune cell) in the liver. It remains unknown how alcohol affects the capacity of neutrophils to control infection, a major hallmark of ALD. We found that binge alcohol drinking impaired important strategies used by neutrophils to contain and resolve infection, resulting in increased liver injury during ALD.
O-GlcNAcylation of ribosomal receptor for activated C-kinase 1 at the amino acid serine122 promotes its stability, ribosome localization and interaction with the protein kinase, PKCβII, thus driving the translation of oncogenes and tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Increased O-GlcNAcylation of ribosomal receptor for activated C-kinase 1 is positively correlated with tumor growth, metastasis and recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
