In this paper, we develop a methodology for identifying groups of textiles that feature consistent associations among techniques used in distinct production phases. We employ this methodology to analyze 141 textiles recovered from a single grave in the middle Chincha Valley, Peru that dates from the Late Horizon (AD 1400 – 1532) to the Colonial Period (AD 1532 – 1825). Six groupings of textile production techniques were identified, each of which may have corresponded to a distinct community of weavers associated with this grave. We argue that this methodology can provide insights into communities of weavers within and outside the Andes.
We report on two cases where thoracolumbar burst fractures were caused by seizure activity and missed due to confounding symptoms. When burst fractures are missed and treatment delayed, there is a potential for neurological consequences. This paper serves as another call for a high-degree of clinical suspicion when treating post-ictal patients to ensure they undergo a focused neurological examination of the lower extremities. If unresponsive/uncooperative, spinal precautions should be maintained until the spine is cleared. If the patient is complaining pain possibly originating from the spine, radiographic evaluations are warranted to prevent deficits caused by a missed thoracolumbar fracture.
This study estimates the health status during the first years of life in children from the Imperial Roman community of Portus Romae using microscopic enamel defect chronology. These are non-fatal events track the way enamel is laid down in tooth development and are permanent markers of dietary and non-fatal disease stress. The prevalence distribution, compared with the previously published isotopic dietary signals, suggests that the maximum stress relates to the beginning of weaning. Results indicate that each tooth class has a different capability for recording stress and that the maximum sensitivity for this is in the mid-portion of the crown.
This project allows the visually impaired to improve the comprehension of their context by generating a risk map following an analysis of the position, distance, size and motion of the objects present in their environment. This comprehension is refined by data fusion steps applied to predict possible impacts in the near future. A risk map is made up of probabilities generated after executing a set of inferences. These inferences allow the evaluation of future collision risks in different directions by detecting static objects, detecting free passage and analyzing paths followed by dynamic objects in a 3D plane.
Different hypotheses exist to explain settlement on the East Coast of the Yucatan Peninsula during Late Postclassic. The analyses of dental morphology, 87Sr/86Sr and δ18O isotopic data of the human skeletal of El Meco, El Rey, and Tulum (AD 1200-1550) depict different scenarios. El Meco consists of local people only, while 20% are considered as foreigners at El Rey. Tulum has the most varied isotopic values. Yet, Tulum and El Meco display lower dental morphological heterogeneity, while El Rey shows high morphological variability. On regional population dynamics, our results indicate broad trends in population movement along the Yucatecan coast.
"Hemispherotomy is a surgical procedure for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, associated with unilateral hemispheric pathology. Compared to hemispherectomy, hemispherotomy is a less invasive procedure and therefore maybe associated with fewer complications. We report a series of patients who underwent hemispherotomy performed in our centers in Indonesia during a 20 year period and follow-up duration spanning from 24 to 160 months. Our surgical techniques include (a) vertical parasagittal approach, peri-insular hemispherotomy and disconnection, and a modified ""Shimizu approach"". To our knowledge this is the largest case series documenting hemispherotomy in an Indonesian population. Surgical outcome resulted in seizure freedom in 62.5% of people and 81.3% who showed improvement in pre-operative seizure frequency."
Ancestral Klallam people established residence around 2700 years ago in the shelter of Ediz Hook, a long spit on the Strait of Juan de Fuca, coastal Washington State. Čḯxwicən (pronounced ch-WHEET-son) village grew over time as the beach area expanded and created a lagoon. More than once, tsunami generated by large plate boundary earthquakes off the coast traveled up the Strait, overtopping the spit and the site, depositing sand, causing erosion, and in one case knocking down a house wall. People returned and rebuilt in the same house locations multiple times, suggesting investment and persistent ties to specific locations.
Human behavior can be grouped to elaborate profiles that would enable the classification of individuals. Nevertheless, the elaboration of profiles related to human behaviors presents some difficulties associated with the volume of data and the number of parameters typically considered. Thus, the development of software able to automatize the manipulation of data through graphical assistants to produce understandable visualizations of the human behaviors is crucial. The VISUVER framework uses finite state machines to represent and visualize the dynamic human behavior automatically. It also includes similarity metrics based on text mining techniques to establish possible profiles among the analyzed behaviors.
We describe two patients who experienced visual hallucinations, or visions of things not actually there, following brain surgery for uncontrollable seizures. The first patient had severe seizures at 20 months of age from brain injury due to traumatic head injury, and experienced frightening hallucinations for 3 months after having brain surgery at 3 years of age. The second patient had seizures from malformation of tissue in the brain and experienced scary visualizations 18 months after undergoing brain surgery at 6 years of age. In both of these patients, though hallucinations were florid, they subsided within 3-6 months.
The paper deals with the application of the archaeological methods to the structural analysis and the modern methodologies of the point clouds survey, with the purpose of creating a series of products, all used to highlight the building and mechanical history of the edifices and to the knowledge of the seismic history of the territory. The historical center of Florence and, specifically, the church of San Remigio, has been chosen as a case study to illustrate the aforementioned methodology.
Neural networks have shown promising capabilities in dealing with nonlinear systems. Combined with a dynamic part, they can learn and identify complicated systems. On the other hand, fractional order differentiation has provided more degrees of freedom and therefore more accuracy for exploring the behaviour of dynamical systems. This paper introduces a fractional order neural network capable of identifying complicated systems. Input-output representational capacity is shown, learning rules for the parameters are derived and its performance on the real data of a 2.5MW wind turbine is examined. The results are amazing and the method can be used for other industrial systems.
Epilepsy is a disease characterized by transient signs and/or symptoms. It is caused by abnormal discharges in the surface of the brain. Patients with a subtype of epilepsy called epilepsia partialis continua typically suffer from regular jerking activity on the hands and face; this can last many years. This condition is very rare and resistant to current treatments. We examine an elderly woman with epilepsia partialis continua caused by a benign tumor (meningioma). Her symptoms disappeared after adding a recently-marketed antiepileptic drug named perampanel.
An ancient Egyptian child mummy (Roman period, collection of Musée d’art et d’histoire, Geneva, Switzerland) has been investigated by Computed Tomography. The aim of the radiological investigation was to estimate age and sex as well as to record intravitam pathologies and postmortem alterations. Hereby the most interesting findings are multifocal bone lesions affecting the spine and the left hip. Multiple diseases are discussed that could explain these lesions. However, most likely seems an infectious etiology, and tuberculosis (TB) a possible diagnosis. Also regarding the time period TB seems plausible, since the disease was wide spread in ancient Egypt.
This study proposes to document the diet of humans living in Cyprus during Prehistoric times. We measured carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios on human bones from six archaeological sites, as well as few Prehistoric animal bone remains and modern botanical samples. The bone samples were poorly preserved but data obtained on few individuals indicate that protein consumed came from terrestrial animals and plants and that marine resources was not or little consumed if any. The comparison with other sites in the Near East also showed that some plants as legumes could have been a significant resource for Prehistoric human groups in this area.
Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence - AI are being revised and improved but much attention is dedicated to machine learning, while the other side of machine intelligence suitable to control and automation is not well explored. Intelligent Planning is a key issue in machine intelligence but needs to have its design process enhanced and revised. This paper revisits the design of planning solutions with a knowledge engineering approach. Such an approach can open the possibility to apply AI Planning in more complex engineering problems.
In France, the Badegoulian age traditionally accepted for the “pseudo-excise” decorated antler artifacts is mostly based on arguable data from old excavations and/or problematic archaeostratigraphic contexts. We have focused our attention on Pégourié Cave (Lot, France) in order to establish the chronocultural attribution of these specific artifacts. While an archaeostratigraphic reassessment shows that Pégourié can no longer be considered a reliable stratigraphy, direct 14C dating confirms the Badegoulian age of the “pseudo-excise” technique. The defined chronological-range is comparable to data recently obtained in Asturias for “pseudo-excise”-yielding industries, fueling the long-lasting debate around the existence of Badegoulian-like traditions in Spain.
In this paper, we propose a Tri-relational Graph (TG) model for web image annotation, which comprises the image data graph, the region data graph and the label graph as subgraphs, and connects them by an additional tripartite graph induced from image segmentation results and label assignments. Multilevel Random Walk with Restart algorithm on TG is performed to produce vertex-to-vertex relevance. Then semi-supervised learning is used to predict labels for unannotated image regions by inserting unlabeled images and their regions into TG. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed TG model and multilevel RWR algorithm can achieve good performance on image region annotation.
In a study of 604 people living with HIV (PLWH), it was found that these individuals are more likely to suffer from seizures or epileptic fits than the general population. Seizure treatment in PLWH was not always effective, possibly because of the drug interactions between anti-HIV medicines commonly known as antiretroviral therapy (ART) and anti-seizure drugs (ASDs), which can lead to low bloodstream levels of ASDs. PLWH were also more likely to disengage from the hospital’s neurology services. The ASD prescription and the provision of supplementary support services needs to be carefully considered for PLWH presenting with seizures.
Changing auditory pitch perception is known as a side effect of the traditional anti-seizure drug carbamazepine in some patients. However, auditory disturbance has not been previously reported as a side effect of lacosamide, a third-generation anti-seizure drug, blocks sodium channels, as also seen with carbamazepine. This report presents a first case of pitch perception deficit associated with lacosamide, we outline features seen in our patient and compare our findings with those of previous reports describing carbamazepine-associated auditory disturbance.
Artificial Intelligence enabled learning models purely from observed data. This work shows how to learn an optimal control policy for complex dynamic systems in an adaptive real-time fashion. Specifically, Echo State Networks (ESNs) are used to learn the inverse system model that yields the control input for the current output that drives the system toward a desired state. The ESN is a recurrent neural network with fast learning by linear methods such as (recursive) least squares. In an application to oil platforms, the ESN-based controller was shown to learn online the regulation of variables such as the riser inlet pressure.
The Bronze-Iron Age transition in Lika, Croatia is characterized by a rapid and significant transformation in sociopolitical and economic organization, but the area’s challenging environment and topography likely made large-scale agriculture and livestock keeping difficult. New stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values of domesticated animals show that communities adapted by practicing animal husbandry at different spatial and organizational scales. Such strategies included the centralized movement of cattle and ovicaprid herds across large parts of the landscape and individual household management of pigs.
Riga Cathedral (1211 AD) is one of the oldest sacred buildings of the medieval period in Latvia and also the Baltics. In recent years, deformations (cracks) have been observed in a number of Riga historic buildings, including Riga Cathedral. These buildings are supported by waterlogged wooden foundation piles. In this paper, the state of the art of archaeological foundation piles of Riga Cathedral was evaluated by microscopic, chemical and instrumental methods. Severe biological deterioration caused by microorganisms in the majority of pile samples was determined. The loss of foundation supporting strength is considered as the main reason for building deformations.
We report a teenager with childhood onset ‘chapeau de gendarme’ or ‘ictal pouting’ seizures. Chapeau de gendarme ictal sign has been associated with frontal lobe epilepsy, however in this case, after pre-surgical evaluation, we confirmed anterior insular lobe origin. Surgical resection of the insular and frontal-lobe network resulted in seizure freedom. We propose that the anterior insular cortex should be included during invasive investigations of chapeau de gendarme or ictal pouting seizures.
Without making any assumptions on data distribution, we propose a minimax probability extreme learning machine, which combines the benefits of minimax probability machines with extreme learning machines. It can be interpreted geometrically by minimizing the maximum of Mahalanobis distances to the two classes. Then two variants of the MPME are presented. The proposed methods can provide explicit upper-bounds for the generalization error. By comparison with traditional methods, experiments show that the proposed methods achieve comparable results in generalization, and are easy to implement for nonlinear classification.
Co-occurrence of the trio of epilepsy, depression and psychosis is relatively poorly studied, compared to the pairs of disorders within the three. Here we report a case of temporal lobe epilepsy with bizarre bodily hallucinations and brief but severe depressive episodes. Based on the close clinical observation and treatment response of the case, we discuss co-occurrence of the trio of disorders in detail. In patients with epilepsy, depression and psychosis may be more closely related than is currently thought, and co-occur in a different way than in those without epilepsy.
Most status epilepticus in mitochondrial diseases are refractory to treatment, however some drugs used in status are potentially risky in these patients. Perampanel is emerging as an option to treat status epilepticus due to its particular pharmacodymanics. We present three cases of MELAS with refractory status epilepticus (non-convulsive without impairment of consciousness), in which the treatment with high-dose perampanel resolved the acute situation within few hours. These examples show that perampanel may be an effective option in these situations.
This paper presents new carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of human and animal samples from two historical sites in central Italy to determine diet variation at the transition from classical (1st- 3rd century AD) to post-classical (6th – 8th century AD) time. Results obtained showed limited differences between the sites, although the distribution of data reveal a larger dispersion for the Roman set as opposed to the Longobard one. This is interpreted as a result of the mixed composition of the Roman population and might be indicative of a progressive impoverishment in the diet, mostly reliant on grains, during post-classical times.
Shells can be dated using radiocarbon and therefore provide an age which might help to reconstruct the chronology of a site. Sometimes the shells found have been heated. Usually burning is visible as a greyish colour. But sometimes it is not visible. Our results on Anadara uropigimelana and Terebralia palustris shells from Neolithic and Bronze Age sites in Kalba (UAE) show, that the radiocarbon age is not influenced by the heating process, but the mineralogy changes from aragonite to calcite. Besides we finally found out how the shells were heated regarding the use of fire and arrangement of shells.
Forty-one ceramic boxes from the twelfth/thirteenth-century Java Sea Shipwreck were analyzed at Chicago’s Field Museum using elemental analysis (portable x-ray fluorescence, PXRF). Twenty-two samples are bluish-white qingbai-type wares and nineteen have painted black decorations originally covered by a bright green glaze. The main goals were to test whether visually similar ceramics shared similar elemental compositions and to identify ceramics from different production sites (kilns). Based on this study, although PXRF can be successfully used to some degree to differentiate between different groups of qingbai-type ceramics, more research needs to be done on its applicability to painted ware pieces.
Several reports have indicated an association between the presence of extreme delta brush (EDB) in the EEG with poor response to immunotherapy and unfavorable outcome in patients with anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis (ANMDARE). However, the adverse prognostic implication of EBD is less evident in some recent reports. Here, we report an adolescent girl with ANMDARE, who despite persistence of EDB for nearly 2 years in her serial EEGs, had a speedy and sustained response to immunotherapy. Our patient restates that, although presence of EDB supports the diagnosis of ANMDARE, its persistence may not reliably predict the response to immunotherapy and prognosis.
Sometimes marks found on the surfaces of long bones from Plio-Pleistocene sites are small, inconspicuous and thus exhibit ambiguous morphology which makes accurate identification, using standard low-magnification methods, difficult and contentious. I apply high-magnification, scanning electron microscopy to visualize diagnostic features of inconspicuous carnivore marks from long bones that have been fed on exclusively by avian and mammalian carnivores. Results show these marks exhibit morphology that differentiates them from other inconspicuous marks. This leads to improved identification accuracy which contributes to their interpretive potential when reconstructing carnivore and hominin interactions with carcasses and predicting early access by hominins.
Fermentation is a common food preparation technique, particularly in the Arctic and Subarctic. The complex chemical reactions involved in the fermentation process kill harmful bacteria while preserving beneficial vitamins. Despite its ubiquity and chemical complexity, archaeologists have not yet considered the potential effects of fermentation within isotopic dietary reconstructions. This study shows that fermentation produces significant changes in the isotopic values carbon and nitrogen in muscle tissue from central Alaskan salmon. This finding indicates that archaeologists may be able to identify fermentation via isotopic chemistry and has implications for our understanding of cooking and food storage in the past.
Photogrammetry is quickly becoming an important, cost effective method for recording cultural heritage. This technique, which converts overlapping photographs into three dimensional models, is more commonly used on artefacts and other micro-scale features. However, there are also effective landscape applications, with drone-based image collection allowing for large-scale survey of monuments and landscapes. Despite this, few studies have assessed the viability of this technique in regard to landscape studies. This paper provides a series of case studies for the application of photogrammetry in archaeological landscape studies.
Excavations at the site of Kul Tepe in north-western Iran have unearthed various archaeological materials from Late Neolithic/Early Chalcolithic to Achaemenids periods. During the Chalcolithic and the Bronze Age most lithic tools used in Kul Tepe were made of obsidian. From the first and second excavation seasons, 53 and 32 obsidian samples were selected and analyzed by pXRF. According to the results, the main source of obsidian for the workshops in Kul Tepe was Syunik, but other sources of Armenia like Ghegam, Bazenk, Choraphor and Gutansar and the Lake Van region (Nemrut Dağ and Meydan Dağ) were utilized also.
The main objective of this research was a multiple criteria, affective analysis of public spaces constituting cultural heritage (buildings, parks, squares, streets) and events (music, exhibitions, festivals) with the help of Affective Analytics of Demonstration Sites (ANDES). ANDES assists experts in more effective implementation of public spaces planning and participating in a process involving attendees/ visitors. This process involves collecting from visitors and examining various emotional parameters (emotions, valence, arousal) and physiological parameters (average crowd facial temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, crowd composition by sex and age group). Real-time mapping of the above-named parameters of people attending public spaces is conducted, producing personalized tips on ways to make public spaces (events) more efficient and public-centric.
Within the evolutionary dynamics of post-Gravettian techno-complexes, one can observe an intense regionalization phenomenon. To date, typological studies have led to the recognition of several Italian Epigravettian facies in the lithic complexes. With this work we want to add information related to technological pattern which contributes to the debate on the latest Pleistocene complexes to southern Italy. The Grotta della Serratura represents an excellent reference site for the Southern Italy. Thus it begins to bring new technological data that can make important contributions to the discussion of the lithic complexes in the Mediterranean area from the late Upper Paleolithic.
Violence following seizures is uncommon, however, can be extremely distressing to affected patients and their families. While medications are available to treat aggressive behavior, the most commonly used drugs are often associated with considerable side effects. Pindolol is a high blood pressure medication that can be beneficial in treating aggressive behavior in head injury patients. We report a patient with a history of violence following seizures which was completely controlled with pindolol. This finding is important as it provides a novel approach to the treatment of post seizure violence in patients with epilepsy that is better tolerated than typical treatments.
The 5th century is traditionally linked to social and political turmoil, large-scale migration processes and population exchange caused by the so-called ‘Fall of Rome’. However, these hypotheses have recently been challenged by archaeologists: Long-range migration can easily be replaced by small-scale mobility that leads to changing land-use strategies, material distribution networks and closer spheres of individual’s activity. The site catchment of a 5th and 6th century necropolis at Niedernai (Upper Rhine Valley, eastern France) was selected to conduct spatial analyses and thus estimate and interconnect graveyard and settlement distribution in a consistently utilized environment.
One of the major challenges faced in hospitals refers to the increasingly overcrowded patients' queues, which contribute to a potential deterioration of patients' health conditions. One of the reasons of such an inefficiency is a poor allocation of health professionals. In this work, we introduce ElHealth, an IoT-focused model able to monitor patients' usage of hospital rooms and, employing data prediction techniques to anticipate when the demand of a given room will exceeds its capacity, to propose actions to allocate health professionals so as to meet patients needs. ElHealth obtained promising results, decreasing the waiting time by up to 96.71%.
A multi-disciplinary research team presents the paleoenvironmental findings from a project that was carried out in the coastal marshland of southwest Spain. A high-resolution, multi-proxy analysis—the first ever conducted in the area—allowed for a model that relates vegetation history and human impact with climate variability and the potential effects of extreme wave events (EWEs) on settlement patterns during the Copper and Bronze Ages. Significant climate changes and four EWEs were identified for those cultural periods. The magnitude of the second EWE, ~ 4200-4000 cal BP, was large enough to cause major landscape changes and usher in long-term depopulation.
A boy with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome presented with seizure recurrence, loss of alertness, motor and language skills due to vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) electrode dysfunction. The electrode dysfunction was not detected during VNS device check-ups. After electrode replacement and reinitiating VNS, side effects occurred which forced us to switch it off. Switching off the VNS resulted in immediate seizure recurrence and subsequent status epilepticus. The status epilepticus could only be halted by reinitiating VNS therapy. Hereafter, he remained seizure free, is alert, and regained motor and language skills.
Residue analysis of 25 grinding stones from surface contexts in arid South Australia identified starch grains and collagen. Survival of starch in marginal environments is rare, in this case only 7 of the grinding stones retained residues. Two species with underground storage organs –Typha and Crinum spp were identified by geometric morphometric analysis. Both species are recorded as used by Aboriginal people, the latter as a medicinal treatment. These finds are consistent with accounts of this location as a men’s ceremonial site and the seasonal timing (mid-summer). Furthermore, it highlights the resilient nature of starch residues in extreme environmental settings.
We evaluate 250‒850-year-old Scandinavian barley grain materials preserved under three different contexts; desiccated, waterlogged and charred, for their potential to be used in genetic studies. No traces of barley DNA were found in charred specimens. Waterlogged specimens appeared to contain barley DNA, but in too low quantities to allow further analysis. Desiccated samples were by far the most successful and could even be used to study population structures. These analyses support previous claims regarding temporal preservation of population structures in southern Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark), showing that they extend from late 17th to late 19th century at least in southern Sweden.
The original DEMATEL method is a subjectively driven decision-making method. It is certainly an efficient method for identifying key factors in complex systems, but the results based solely on subjective information will also include some accuracy problems. Due to this limitation, a more precise method of combining subjective experience and objective data is crucial to replace the often-used ordinary approach. This study presents a new improved DEMATEL method for the adapting to more complex realities in the detailed design by considering the expert information extraction and data analysis together. In general, the combination of subjective and objective assessment results also enhances the application value of the final DEMATEL results.
The Neolithic painted pottery of northwest China is well-known for its striking beauty and high quality, but little is known about the potters themselves. Similarly, the communities behind the less striking Bronze Age wares are not well understood. Using collections of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities this paper shows how a combination of scientific techniques can be used to throw light on the practices of ceramic making. In particular, the paper reconstructs how past potters coped with the technical challenges local raw materials posed, and how they maintained certain techniques over time, while adapting others to changing needs and expectations.
Pre–Hispanic ceramics from the Metzontla Valley, from the vicinity, and beyond, as well as raw materials were studied. NAA, EDS and XRD were applied. Six ceramic groups were identified: one of them includes pre–Hispanic Popoloca Orange ceramic and one other includes pre–Hispanic Brown and present–day Los Reyes Metzontla ceramic. Apparently raw materials have been the same for a long period of time and Popoloca Orange ceramic is no longer manufactured in the region. Similarities and differences were found among the ceramics of the Metzontla Valley and those of other sites of the Popoloca area and beyond.
We argue that San Marcos potters were using clay from Tunque Pueblo to cover the outside of their vesselsduring AD 1400-1700 in New Mexico.We used LA-ICP-MS to analyze 72 samples. LA-ICP-MS aids in determining the chemistry of different clays pottery is made from, which then allows us to potentially determine the geographic origins of those clays. Given San Marcos potters’ apparent reliance on this yellow clay over time, our findings demonstrate that extremely stable social networks were developed and sustained among Rio Grande Pueblo households and communities across north central New Mexico.
During blooming the jellyfish population rapidly increases in a small geographical area, which importantly affects the local ecosystem. Bloom population dynamics prediction can be established by analyzing population dynamics of polyps, which are one of the forms in the jellyfish life cycle. This requires counting polyps in underwater images, however manual counting is a time-consuming task as these images might contain over a thousand polyps. We propose a polyp detection method which automates manual polyp counting. We show that our method is fast and achieves a high detection accuracy which leads to an accurate polyp count estimation.
We present new AMS radiocarbon measurements and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data obtained on human bone collagen, molecular and isotopic data obtained from ceramic beakers, and user-wear data of flint and bone tools from several CWC graves in Lithuania and Western Belarus. The bone collagen stable isotope data demonstrate that the majority of consumed protein was derived from terrestrial resources. Organic residue analysis of two CWC beakers yielded lipids consistent with ruminant carcass and dairy fats, whilst use-wear analyses indicates that bone pins, flint blades and axes were used as grinders, functional tools or had been carefully renewed before deposition respectively.
This study investigates the effectiveness of batch and data streaming classification algorithms in detecting adverse events in a war theater based on infrastructure development spending data and other variables. From the country level, fewer of the project investments affect the adverse events than the project investments at the region level. The study also uses cost-sensitive measures to address the unbalanced nature of the data. The results demonstrate that data streaming algorithms often outperform batch algorithms. In addition, the data stream setting allows one to observe the performance of the models over time and detect concept drift due to changing data distribution.
This article aims to shed light on trade connections and mobility in the Aegean during the Mycenaean palatial and postpalatial periods (1400-1050 CE) through ancient DNA of livestock. We sequenced pig and cattle mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from Tiryns, Greece and discovered an Italian pig haplotype during the palatial period, which is the first time that this haplotype is found outside Italy. We were unable to trace diachronic changes in the composition of cattle livestock, because only the palatial period samples yielded ancient DNA. The results of this study corroborate that pigs were translocated through various patterns of Mediterranean mobility.
Hypotheses on why the 1845 Franklin expedition to the Arctic ended in tragedy include suggestions of lead poisoning. Lead levels in hair were analysed from a Franklin expedition member, HDS Goodsir. Lead levels in Goodsir’s blood were approximated to determine lead burden in the three months prior to death. Lead isotope ratios in Goodsir’s hair were almost identical to that of the bodies discovered on King William and Beechey Islands and were high by today’s standards. Estimated blood lead levels suggest that lead exposure, whilst high, may not have been sufficient tocause worsening physical and mental symptoms.
This paper presents, for the first time, the results of starch grain and geochemistry analyses conducted on a sediment core from Ulong Island, Palau. Along with charcoal and radiocarbon analyses, the results provide a history of human arrival and activity at Ulong and reveal three phases of land use. Phase 1, from 3000-2000 BP, represents an initial phase of clearance and gardening associated with temporary/intermittent use of the island. Phase 2 is a period of reduced and stabilized gardening associated with more permanent habitation from 2000-1000 BP. Finally, Phase 3 represents the period of island abandonment, after 1000 BP, up to the arrival of Europeans in 1783.
From the point of view of economic benefit and environmental protection, dynamic economic emission dispatch problem (DEED) serves to save power generation cost and reduce emission pollutants while satisfying four kinds of practical constraints such as generator capacity, power balance, generating unit ramp-rate and spinning reserve. We combine an improved heuristic algorithm and a constraint handling method to schedule the power outputs of NG generating units over T time intervals for DEED. Accordingly, an optimal combination of power outputs can be determined in a short period of time, and it contributes to both cost saving and pollutants reduction of DEED.
Recognizing human gestures have become an inevitable part in various fields like surveillance, entertainment, healthcare, etc. This survey classifies the recognition task using two techniques; device-based method and device-free method. The implementation of device-free method are identified under two different approaches; model-based and learning –based. In depth studies of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning algorithms (DL) are presented under learning-based strategies. Various signals pre-processing, feature extraction, selection, and classification techniques that are widely adopted for gesture recognition along with the environmental factors that influence the recognition accuracy are discussed. It was reported that Channel State Information (CSI), a metric of Wi-Fi (device-free sensing method) shows better recognition performance compared to another techniques. This survey spots the challenges and opportunities in device-free gesture recognition using Wi-Fi CSI.
Ostrich eggshell beads first appeared 40-50 thousand years ago in Africa, and represent some of the first evidence for personal ornamentation. In this article we outline a statistical method for distinguishing ostrich eggshell beads perforated with a hand turned drill bit and those created with a hafted drill. This distinction has important implications for understanding past bead-making traditions across space and time, and for tracing the first appearance and spread of hafted drilling. We also define a set of terms which we hope will allow for a more standardized discussion of bead production signatures and techniques.
The archaeometric study of the Punic black-gloss ware found in Nora (south-western Sardinia, Italy) indicates that two different productions coexisted at the site between the IV century and the II century BC. On the basis of the petrographic and chemical analysis, both productions were imported from the northern African area and from the western Sardinia (Tharros), respectively, and are characterised by quite similar production choices, also in terms of firing temperatures. This can be interpreted as the integration into the Sardinia traditions of the Punic influences, which gave life to regional productions.
Feature subset selection is an essential machine learning approach aimed at the process of dimensionality reduction of the input space. The fuzzy set and the rough set are two different but complementary theories that apply the fuzzy rough dependency as a criterion for performing feature selection. However, this concept can only maintain a maximal dependency function. It cannot fit a particular data set well. Therefore, in the current study, a novel intuitionistic fuzzy rough set model is proposed that fits the data well and prevents misclassification. Firstly, intuitionistic fuzzy decision of a sample is introduced using neighborhood concept. Then, intuitionistic fuzzy lower and upper approximations are constructed using intuitionistic fuzzy decision and parameterized intuitionistic fuzzy granule. Furthermore, a new dependency function is established. Moreover, a greedy forward algorithm is given using the proposed concept to calculate reduct set. From the experimental results, it can be observed that the proposed model provides more accurate reduct set than existing model.
One method for treating certain types of drug-resistant seizures is vagal nerve stimulation (VNS). VNS requires a generator that must be replaced periodically due the battery expiring. These generator replacements are typically routine without complications. We present a case report of a 52-year-old female with a longstanding history of drug-resistant epilepsy that included focal impaired awareness seizures. She had previously undergone a generator replacement without complication. Her latest replacement was accompanied by multiple bouts of asystole. We discuss the case, possible causes of the asystole, and its relevance to the future of VNS generator replacement and epilepsy treatment.
We develop a new divide-and-conquer framework for improving visual quality of degraded images, and make use of different image contents and their characteristics for image restoration and enhancement. Our framework is efficiently implemented, and is simply extended to other algorithms for promoting performances. 1) Dividing: we decompose an image into different components by considering their visual importance and exploiting their differences. 2) Processing: we establish different models for image subspace restoration and enhancement, and use existing methods to tackle them respectively. 3) Integrating: we employ an effective fusion scheme to integrate post-processed subspaces for final image.
The significance of some genetic changes is not yet clear, especially for epilepsy. We studied a family in which two children have X chromosome alteration (Xp22.31 microduplication) associated with epilepsy. The boy had benign (rolandic) epilepsy with seizures on awakening and writing/calculating disorders. The sister had epilepsy with sudden jerks of the limbs (juvenile myoclonic epilepsy). The mother, carrier of the genetic alteration, and the father did not present epilepsy or other disorders. These data suggest that this mutation may play a role in the appearance of epilepsy in these patients, probably together with genes specific to epilepsy.
In 2016-2017, the Palaepaphos Urban Landscape Project (Cyprus) introduced a pilot study based on geoarchaeological techniques to address issues relating to the extensive use of mudbricks in the construction of a recently discovered monumental rampart. The impressive defensive monument was a major investment of the fifth-century BCE royal authorities of ancient Paphos. The paper presents a detailed description of the geoarchaeological analyses conducted on the mudbricks. The results provide new information on the production of earthen building materials, especially with respect to regional manufacturing practices. They also highlight environmental choices in relation to raw material selection and usage in the context of the construction of a civic monument.
Angiitis is a medical terminology of Latin and Greek origin meaning inflammation of the walls of blood vessels. Primary Angiitis of the Central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) is an inflammation of the blood vessels that is limited to the brain and spinal cord. The inflammation of the blood vessels is not caused by an infection like viruses or bacteria. The patients affected with such a disease can present with different symptoms. It can cause repeated seizures that are difficult to treat. It is a rare disease that is difficult to recognize, diagnose and treat.
Prehistoric peoples in the American Southwest made stone tools of obsidian (volcanic glass). Sources of obsidian are chemically distinct, and using x-ray flourescence (XRF), artifacts can be connected to particular sources. We analyzed 343 projectile points and 271 pieces of flaking waste from a group of Sinagua sites (1050-1300 AD) near Flagstaff. Obsidian in these sites mostly came from the Government Mountain source, 30 km west, with a few pieces from another nearby source. Two points made of obsidian from southern Arizona and New Mexico represent exchange. The earlier pre-agricultural points in our area show more variety, suggesting that these Archaic people were more mobile.
The Northern Tsimshian are an Indigenous people whose homeland includes the coastal islands around the city of Prince Rupert, British Columbia, and parts of the Skeena and Nass rivers. Each year, thousands of eulachon (small, oily fish) spawn in the lower reaches of the Nass. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Tsimshian households had rights to harvest eulachon, which were smoked, dried, or rendered into oil. Some Northern Tsimshian households became wealthy by controlling the eulachon oil trade. Our paper explores the deep history of eulachon fishing in the region through zooarchaeological, ethnographic, and oral historical lines of evidence.
Deposits rich in Mesolithic settlement debris were located 4-7 m below sea level off Orehoved, Denmark. Field archaeologists had to determine expeditiously where to focus excavations before the site was destroyed by a major infrastructure project. Through analysis of wear on dorsal ridges of flint flakes it was demonstrated that much of the assemblage from test pits on higher ground were rounded due to redeposition by waves and currents. Follow-up excavation in a low-lying area located a layer with numerous artefacts in stone, bone, and plant material that had remained undisturbed since their days of deposition 8000 years ago.
Christianson syndrome (CS) is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the brain during infancy. Clinical features include intellectual disability, limited speech, difficulties with coordination and with walking in addition to seizures that may become drug-resistant. We describe two patients with CS who developed Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Our two cases highlight the features of seizures and EEG findings in CS in children with drug-resistant epilepsy.
The village of Orduña has played throughout centuries as an important exchange point. Recently, first material relicts evidencing pottery production were found in archaeological excavations, where numerous ceramic sherds along with at least one ceramic kiln dated back to the 17th-19th century were unearthed. In the present work, a selection of 100 sherds have been subjected to a multi-analytical approach by ICPMS, XRD and SEM-EDS. The results allowed establishing seven compositional groups responding to different technotypes and depicting the diachronic evolution of the ceramic production. In addition, the main technological features used by the potters of Orduña were identified.
Online advertising builds on a system (real-time bidding, RTB) where ad impressions are auctioned among hundreds of advertisers interested in displaying their ads. Tons of user data are provided to such advertisers in order to guide their bidding decision and maximize the profit of ad platforms. However, serious risks to privacy arise. We propose a system that regulates user data distribution to potentially interested bidders by limiting the number of participants in auctions. Our system is designed to ensure that the revenue of ad platforms is maximized while the abuse of malicious advertisers is prevented to a large degree.
The main focus of the present study was to explore the longitudinal changes in the brain executive control system and default mode network after hemispherotomy. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging we collected in two children with drug-resistant epilepsy who underwent hemispherotomy. Two patients with different curative effects showed different trajectories of brain connectivity after surgery. The seizure recurrence might due to the synchrony of epileptic neurons between both hemispheres being preserved by residual neural pathways. Loss of interhemispheric correlations with increased intrahemispheric correlations can be considered as a neural marker for evaluating the success of hemispherotomy.
Analysis of over one million animal bones, teeth and shells from Čḯxwicən (pronounced ch-WHEET-son) village, coastal Washington State, shows that Indigenous people relied on over 100 species of shellfish, fish, birds, and mammals for over 2000 years. Animals and in turn people, coped with large-magnitude earthquakes, and changes in climate and coastal habitat. Tsunamis affected shellfish and fish more than mammals and birds. People were resilient to such impacts: they returned, rebuilt, and adapted to changed environments. Two households responded differently to one tsunami, which tells us that the impact of “disasters” on communities depends on social conditions.
A 21 year-old male with Dravet Syndrome (DS) died of the consequences of brain swelling 3 hours after a seizure occurring during physical activity. Cases of fatal brain swelling in patients with sodium channel mutations - a characteristic of DS - after fever or prolonged seizures have been reported raising the question whether sodium channel dysfunction may contribute to brain swelling and thereby to the high mortality in DS. We report on our patient and discuss whether the combination of increased temperature and sodium channel dysfunction may not only trigger seizures but also a fatal cascade leading to cardio-respiratory collapse.
Visual traits and measurements that support distinguishing dog and wolf skeletal remains have been long-used, but insufficiently researched. We evaluated 14 of these, including dental abnormalities; mandible shape; orbital angle; hard palate; snout dimensions; and skull dimensions. We found only a few reliable measures, including skull height, very small or large orbital angle, snout width index, and specific measures of the 1st molar and 4th premolar teeth. Thus, much earlier research now must be re-considered toward use of combined visual, measured, and genetic traits for accurate archaeological identifications.
We present the case of a rare genetic form of epilepsy (MECP2 duplication syndrome) that is usually unresponsive to drug therapy. In our case, we show how valproic acid can help control seizures in some children with this rare genetic condition. The benefits of using valproic acid include its effectiveness as a single drug therapy, its ability to target multiple brain mechanisms, and the possibility of combining it with other drugs for an enhanced effect. There are side effects of valproic acid, but these can be addressed by reducing the drug dose and closely monitoring the patient’s bloodwork.
Minute glassy particles occur in the burn field after an Iron Age longhouse (500-100 BC). The particles are made of rounded quartz and orthoclase grains, gas vesicles, and carbonaceous material bonded together by a potassium-rich silicate glass. The presence of gas vesicles and carbon suggest that melting of a mixture of biomass ash and soil was initiated at 700-800oC and continued to about 1000oC. A source of 50% sandy soil, 41% barley straw, and 9% oak branches best explains the glass composition. The fire was of short duration resulting in partial melting of a daub wall and the collapse of the house.
The lack of consensus surrounding the macroscopic determination of high-quality black flint discovered at the Aldenhoven Plateau sites (Rhineland, North-Western Germany), from the beginning of the Middle Neolithic, has far-reaching consequences for the anthropological understanding of the socio-cultural dynamics involved in the neolithization of north-western Europe. Here, we present an integrated study of this flint using geochemical and technological analysis. Although it must be enriched, it suggests new insights relating to the repopulation of the German Rhineland after the dissolution of the first agro-pastoral communities. The impact of Belgian populations seems limited and oriented toward its eastern part.
In patients with severe drug-resistant seizures, corpus callosotomy (CC) is used to surgically disconnect the brain hemispheres to stop seizure spread and decrease seizure frequency. We researched CC results in adults and children and examined whether intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG), a brain-wave recording from the surface of the brain, could predict the seizure reduction. We showed that CC improves seizures leading to loss of muscle tone (atonic seizures) and focal seizures with impaired awareness but does not alter outcomes for generalized convulsions or tonic seizures. We concluded that intracranial EEG prior to CC does not help to predict postsurgical seizure reduction.
The Higashimyou site in Saga, western Japan, yielded over 700 baskets of the initial Jomon period from 8000 to 7300 cal BP. Large baskets were made mostly with splints of two arboreal species, Sapindus mukorossi and Ficus erecta, and small ones were made mostly with stems of two vine species, Sinomenium acutum and Trachelospermum. The bodies of the baskets were made by various types of twill, weave, and twining. The employment of various basketry techniques at this site showed that most of the basketry techniques used in later periods were already established in the initial Jomon period.
Obsidian is widely present at archaeological sites in the form of domestic refuse.The occurrence of surface water diffusion on these artifacts, and the formation of hydration layers over time, permits the chronometric dating of the specimens and the contexts in which they occur. Several environmental and chemical variables impact the rate of water diffusion, with the internal structural water of the glass being one of the most influential parameters. Our analysis of over 30 geological deposits shows that internal structural water may be highly variable within an ancient quarry but can be monitored by measurement of the glass specific gravity, or density. Using infrared spectroscopic analysis a calibration has been developed that relates obsidian density to structural water concentration in order that the appropriate hydration rate constants may be applied.
The consequences of natural or man-made catastrophes can be devastating. To minimize its impact, it is crucial to carry out a rapid analysis of the affected environment after they occur, without putting human lives at risk. This research work discusses an architecture that allows the deployment of teams of drones that are intelligently controlled by software agents. These agents are able to analyze what happens in the environment, detecting dangerous situations and supporting the security personnel. A case study is presented in which the spread of toxic smoke in an industrial complex which has suffered an earthquake is monitored.
Evidence of Mesolithic mortuary practice is rare in Middle/Northern Scandinavia. We present the newly discovered Brunstad burial, Norway, dating to c. 5900 cal BC. This inhumation of an adult individual placed in flexed position, with bad bone preservation in very hard surrounding soils, could be recovered and reconstructed with the help of a two-step multidisciplinary excavation method. Being rare in its regional context the burial exhibits features known from other Mesolithic sites in Europe, like island location, proximity to settlement and body position of the deceased. We suggest that it might represent a distinct mode of burial at the time.
Goal recognition is the task of inferring an agent's goals given some or all of the agent's observed actions. However, few researchers focus on how to improve the usage effectiveness of knowledge produced by a goal recognition system. In this work, we propose a probabilistic goal recognition approach tailored to a dynamic shortest-path network interdiction problem. Also, we develop (i) two behavior modeling approaches to help solve both the data-intensive and no available data situations; (ii) a heuristic named Subjective Confidence that uses variance in particle system for flexible resource allocation adjustment.
Although anti-seizure drugs are often initially evaluated for adjunctive use (in combination with other drugs), monotherapy (single drug) may reduce treatment-related side effects. Perampanel is approved for adjunctive treatment of focal seizures, with/without secondarily generalized seizures, and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in epilepsy patients ≥12 years. Perampanel is approved for use as monotherapy for focal seizures in the U.S.A. We report data from seven patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who converted to perampanel monotherapy during open-label extension studies. Perampanel monotherapy was well‑tolerated, and six patients experienced improved seizure control. Our limited data suggest perampanel monotherapy may be achievable in some patients.
Driving Behavior is a complex concept describing how the driver operates the vehicle in the context of the driving scene and surrounding environment. This paper outlines an unconventional theoretical framework whereby Driving Behavior is viewed in a holistic perspective in terms of dimensions and influencing aspects within the Driver-Vehicle-Environment system. A premier and unbiased last-decade overview of the Machine Learning techniques adopted in assessing Driving Behavior was revealed, laying foundations for grasping the major contributions and shortcomings in the state-of-the-art research. Interesting research questions were prepared, and their answers gave an eye-opening discovery for further research endeavours.
Gold is one of the most renowned commodities in Africa’s economic history. In spite of that importance, archaeology has so far contributed relatively little to the theme. Through elemental analysis of 12th-13th century gold and silver artefacts from a Senegalese archaeological site, the paper presents evidence of a little known facet of the ancient linkages between West and North Africa. It convincingly shows that, in addition to the documented mass export of West African raw gold to North Africa in medieval times, there was also a today largely neglected traffic of alloyed gold (and silver) into West Africa.
Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) autoimmune encephalitis, a nonbacterial inflammatory disease of the brain that presents with headache, confusion, and seizures. In a few patients, it can co-occur with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein associated demyelination (MOGAD), the disease targeting the nerve sheath causing damage to the optic nerve and weakness in arms or legs. Using corticosteroid as anti-inflammatory therapy, we successfully treated a patient who developed blindness. She subsequently developed recurrent seizures from anti-NMDAR encephalitis and her serum tested positive for MOG antibodies leading to the diagnosis of overlapping MOGAD. MOGAD should be suspected in all patients with unusual presentation of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.
"With the exponential growth in data production rates, the available network resources are becoming the actual bottleneck for several IoT applications where the most critical requirement is the low latency. This implies the need to overcome the typical approach of raw data consumption happening at the opposite endpoint with respect to its production. In the context of IoT data stream analytics, for instance, the detection of anomalies or rare events is one of the most demanding tasks, as it needs prompt detection to increase its significance. This paper presents IRESE, a rare-event detection system able to apply unsupervised machine learning techniques on the incoming data, directly on affordable gateways located in the IoT edge. IRESE has been tested against various audio rare-event categories, achieving precision and recall measures above 90%."" "
Autoimmune epilepsy is a relatively rare type of epilepsy that was recently recognized by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). Usually, patients with this disorder present with behavioral changes, cognitive impairement, and drug resistant focal seizures. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid levels of antineuronal antibodies is high in these patients. Most effective treatment options include steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, plama exchange, in addition to immunosuppressants. We describe a young adult with drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy who was found to have two antineuronal antibodies (glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 and P/Q voltage gated calcium channel antibodies). This patient responded well to steroid therapy.
Microstratigraphic analysis of several floors of Room 8 to the protohistoric site El Calvari del Molar (NE Spain). Micromorphology allowed us to determine the composition, the processing and the technical treatment as well as the possible origin of the lithological materials used in their manufacture. The floors are composed of earth construction, made of local carbonated materials. Mixing this material with water would cause a precipitation of CaCO3 favoured by the impermeability of their preparation layers leading to the semi-cementation of the floor. This type of earth floor brings together a series of characteristics at the construction level similar to lime mortars.
Influenza is a common, worldwide acute infectious respiratory disease that only occasionally complicates with neurological disturbances, including brain infection (encephalitis), diffuse brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), followed by seizures or epileptic status (repeated seizures). They occur more frequently in children during influenza infection and less common after vaccination. We describe in this case report three healthy patients who suffered from seizures in the context of influenza A or B infection and who did not have evidence of encephalitis. This is an uncommon situation, particularly in healthy adults, but should be considered to avoid potentially harmful therapeutic and diagnostic procedures.
Archaeologists have focused on the social changes coinciding with the widespread use of bow and arrow technologies in North America, and specifically on the Northwest Coast the emergence of large plank house villages. Variation in the styles of stone tools used for darts and arrows from dated archaeological sites in Puget Sound and southwest British Columbia was examined using social network analysis. Social networks continued to expand and strengthened until 1600 BP when the bow and arrow became widely used in the area. These findings suggest that hunting shifted from a collective activity to an individualized pursuit.
Multivariate time series classification is an artificial intelligence task that predicts the behavior of the data generation mechanism through the analysis of a set of measured signals. In this context, this paper proposes an efficient algorithm based on the analysis of frequency-based information through cepstrum, a mathematical tool used also in other signal processing applications. Notably, the paper proves the effectiveness of the method in deriving the final classification from multiple input signals that are optimally combined. The method is applied to the challenging task of determining whether a human is manipulating a smartphone while driving.
This paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm to achieve less economic cost in dealing with real-world engineering problems. The hybrid algorithm divides the whole population into two sub-populations with equal size, and simultaneously optimizes the sub-populations by different algorithms. It not only can enhance the information exchange among individuals, but also can enrich the diversity of the whole population to avoid trapping into local optimum. Finally, these experimental results receive satisfied performance in terms of unconstrained/constrained test functions and each constrained engineering problems.
Thin-section microscopy and chemical analyses (coupled ICP-MS ICP-OES) were jointly applied to establishing a ‘reference group’ representative of the ceramic produced at Selinunte in south western Sicily during the 4th and 3rd century BCE. Homogeneous textural/compositional features characterize the thirty-seven ceramic samples, representative of daily-use common ware, collected from the dump of two kilns sited in the FF1 production area. The obtained chemical ‘reference group’ is fully compatible with the geo-lithological characteristics of the area and shows satisfactorily low standard deviations. It will be applied to better define the ceramic trade networks in south western Sicily at that time.
Traumatic brain hemorrhage can be associated with lifelong functional, cognitive and emotional impairment. Management of traumatic brain hemorrhage includes monitoring and treatment of seizure activity. Studies have shown that new onset epileptiform activity can be present despite absence of any neurological deficits in cases of acute intracranial hemorrhage. Here we document the electrographic changes in the human brain in response to acute traumatic brain hemorrhage as detected by intracranial sEEG electrodes.
Chronological information in archaeological rescue excavations is usually limited and the eventual absence of organic remains limits the application of radiocarbon. However, determining the last use of archaeological combustion structures can be done through archaeomagnetism. Here is presented an archaeomagnetic study carried out on kilns for bell and tile fabrication in Spain. Two full vector archaeomagnetic datings were obtained indicating that last kilns’ use occurred almost simultaneously or closely confined in time in the AD 14th century. Dating resolution obtained is comparable to radiocarbon with the benefit that archaeomagnetism dates the last use (abandonment) of the structures and no material associated to it which might be younger.
Analysis of archaeological settlements along the coast of Georgia, USA, shows evidence of a large-scale migration to the region around 1400 CE. The nature of settlement change and the timing of the creation of new settlements on the coast are related to the abandonment of the nearby Savannah River Valley. Immigrants from the Savannah River Valley may have chosen to settle among existing communities on the coast due to preexisting social connections and the offer of alternative life-ways following the abandonment of their previous social systems.
The pre-Hispanic evidence of distilled beverages still remains highly controversial in Mesoamerica. The distillation procedure of Tequila involves only the blue agave (tequiliana weber), while any type of agave may be used to produce Mezcal. The origin of mezcal is a matter of debate and it is still unclear whether distilled drinks were produced in Mexico before the Spaniards arrival. A detailed archaeomagnetic study of several ovens where cooked maguey remains were discovered in Central Mexico, revealed that the alcohol distillation was known in Mesoamerica long before the arrival of Europeans, for at least 25 centuries.
Geological and archaeological analysis of stone masonries in standing structures helps reveal information about use of natural resources, organization of labour and supplies on the construction site. An interdisciplinary approach was applied for the study of building materials in distinct construction phases of the inner defensive wall in the fortified citadel of Carcassonne (Aude, France). Stratigraphic analysis of the architecture, short-range spectral remote sensing (hyperspectral imaging, portable Near Infrared - NIR) and portable ED-XRF measurements (Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence spectroscopy) were combined to classify sandstone elements and delineate raw materials varieties and their use or re-use through time.
Patients with gliomas, a common type of primary brain tumor, can suffer from epilepsy. It is thought that seizures and epilepsy arises in glioma patients from the signaling via glutamate receptors. Therefore, we sought to evaluate perampanel, a glutamate receptor antagonist. In the single-arm study, we evaluated patients with focal-onset seizures caused by underlying glioma. Eight subjects received perampanel and six patients experienced some benefit from perampanel therapy. Perampanel should be considered in patients with glioma-associated epilepsy.
The scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) has shown great potential for documenting and characterising archaeological residues. This instrument provides high resolution images of tool residues in situ on the stone surface at very high magnifications, as well as an elemental fingerprint of adhering material. When used together with traditional optical microscopes, it provides a powerful means for identifying tool residues. Here, we propose a sequential protocol for residue analysis that includes an in situ residue screening of the tool with stereomicroscopes and SEM-EDS; followed by analysis of extracted residues under the transmitted light microscope and SEM-EDS.
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive form of brain stimulation, was used to treat muscle jerks in the upper limbs caused by epilepsy in a patient with mitochondrial disease. The stimulation was administered via two electrodes on the scalp for five days and muscle jerks and epileptic activity spikes were counted and compared from before to after stimulation treatment. Unfortunately, the treatment was not effective in reducing muscle jerks in the arms and shoulders. This study highlights that more data is needed to determine if and under which conditions the tDCS treatment is effective.
Predicting the glucose level in Type 1 diabetes patients is a critical but also challenging task. We propose Deep Glucose Forecasting, a deep learning architecture based on recurrent neural networks which is able to predict the glucose level of a patient. We define an architecture composed by two models: one observing past measurements (injections, carbohydrate intake and glucose) and the second one exploiting future inputs over a fixed prediction horizon. The model, trained on 100 patients of the UVA/Padova simulator, outperforms classical population models generalizes to unseen real patients and reaches personalized models performance on a real patient via fine-tuning.
To monitor the effect of muscle relaxant drugs in critically ill patients, we stimulate the muscle in rapid four sequence of electric impulse (Train of Four [TOF]), which makes the muscle twitch. Typical sites for TOF stimulation are the wrist, leg or facial nerve. We found electrical disturbance on electrode recording of brain activity through an advanced EEG software which captured the characteristic TOF neurostimulation pattern at the facial nerve location, but was mistakenly thought to be a seizure pattern. This case provides a unique ICU EEG artifact, helpful for nursing and ICU providers.
Mechatronics design is a complex task involving many interdependencies between subsystems alongside a variety of objectives and constraints. Due to this complexity, a concurrent, systematic and multi-objective design methodology is crucial to replace the often-used sequential approach which deals with the different domains separately. This study presents a fuzzy-based approach for the modeling of a unified performance evaluation index in the detailed design of mechatronic systems by considering the interactions and correlations amongst the objectives. Using this method, we carried out the design of a vision-guided quadcopter which demonstrated performance improvements compared to a commercial system designed with traditional approach.
Modeling and analysis of students' performance is a central task in educational data mining. Nowadays, the gathered datasets have become high-dimensional, hence the quest for appropriate analysis techniques. In this work, a performance trajectory, which describes the student’s achievements over time, is used as an input unit. A general framework that utilizes two kernel methods is proposed and demonstrated on two case studies. Diffusion maps reduce the dimension of the input data and reveal important underlying factors. Then, statistical analysis is performed via the kernel two-sample test. Last, the test’s results are interpreted in terms of the identified factors.
Extraventricular neurocytomas (EVN) are benign tumors that are generally found in children and young adults and can present in a variety of locations in the central nervous system. EVNs located in the temporal lobe can cause drug-resistant focal seizures. These seizures can look like lip smacking, staring, drooling and clenching of extremities. This report presents a rare case of a mesial temporal EVN and describes the clinical, radiological, pathological, and prognostic differences of EVNs located in the mesial temporal lobe with EVNs located in the neocortical temporal lobe. Gross total resection of mesial temporal EVNs with seizure monitoring during surgery provides an excellent prognosis and successful seizure control.
Grinding cereals into flour has taken place since the Palaeolithic period, yet the grinding method employed has often not been investigated. Our study discovered the different features of use-wear traces associated with dry- and wet-grinding of cereals, which can be used to infer the ancient grinding techniques. Applying this reference baseline to Jiahu, an early Neolithic site known for the early rice cultivation in Central China, reveals that dry-grinding was employed for cereal processing 9000 years ago. This grinding method could have been inherited from the earlier hunter-gatherers, but could also result from a broad-spectrum subsistence strategy adopted at Jiahu.
Intraoperative electrocorticography (iECoG) recording is recommended for treating cavernoma related epilepsy. However, only “interictal” paroxysmal activities are generally recordable. We surgically treated a 15-year-old girl with drug-resistant epilepsy associated with radiation-induced cavernoma in the right lateral temporal lobe. iECoG revealed paroxysmal activities in the cortex around the cavernoma. Additionally, continuous subclinical “ictal” discharges with high-frequency oscillations (HFO), confined to the histologically non-sclerotic hippocampus, were recorded. iECoG and HFO analysis revealed high epileptogenicity in the non-sclerotic hippocampus of this patient.
This papper presents new information about the presence of cultigens in the Sierras Pampeanas of Argentina during the late Holocene. A wide variety of wild species was used in this period along with Zea mays (corn), Cucurbita sp. (squash), undifferentiated tubers, and Phaseolus sp. (beans), identified by the presence of microremains in knapped tools. The obtained data allow discussing the diversity of the resources utilized and the importance of cultigens in prehispanic times in a context that is currently considered the southern limit of prehispanic food production economies.
Bath-shaped basins from archaeological sites in the Levant date from the 8th through 6th centuries BCE. Although generally interpreted as bathtubs or coffins, the archaeological context often fits an industrial interpretation. To test the hypothesis of wool working activities, we sampled four vessels from Israel and Jordan using organic residue analysis. Lipid profiles similar to date palm kernel oil (DPKO) were identified that matched the lipid profiles from a vessel reported in another publication. The historic uses of DPKO as a textile soap support that bath-shaped basins functioned in wool processing.
Case studies generate new ideas and offer guidance for patients with uncommon diseases. However, case studies are prone to factors that can influence study outcomes. N-of-1 trials minimize this bias by borrowing concepts from randomized controlled trials. N-of-1 trials are a double-blinded randomized cross-over trial within a limited number of patients, often as small as a single patient. These trials are best used for management of chronic diseases and therapies with quick onset and offset, such as in patients receiving therapy for epilepsy.
The Hepu Han Tombs, located on the south coast of China, can date back to the Han dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD), when Hepu was an important international trade port of the maritime Silk Road, spreading strong and persistent cultural influence to neighboring countries from ancient China, and also connecting China with African, European and other Asian countries in national migration, religious communication, political, trade, technical and cultural exchanges, and so on. With the aim of detecting two burial mounds at Jinjiling Site of Hepu Han Tombs, ERT and limited drillings were performed in the area.
Epilepsy is a disorder characterized by the predisposition to develop recurrent unprovoked seizures. A seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. Cingulate gyrus epilepsy represents a rare form of epilepsy and can be challenging to diagnose. Seizures from the cingulate gyrus manifest with a variety of features such as fright, changes in mood, vocalizations, excessive motor movements and repetitive behaviours. We describe a boy who developed cingulate gyrus epilepsy secondary to a low-grade tumor (ganglioglioma). His seizures were characterized by unique sensory phenomenon – spiders, ladybugs and bees.
Sheep is a highly diverse livestock species with breeds raised for wool, milk, meat and fat or combinations of these products. But the emergence of lineages bred for these traits is still not very well understood. We apply a Geometric Morphometric approach to the ankle bones of eight domestic and wild sheep populations from Europe, SW and Central Asia. By comparing the shape of the ankle bones of these modern and prehistoric populations we evaluated their morphological relationships. Our study allows concluding that wool and fat-tailed sheep represent lineages that independently emerged in the Near East during the Bronze Age.
Financial markets prediction has always been exciting. Using the historical data of any market to predict its future is not a new scientific topic but with the emergence of machine learning more complex patterns have been found and the quote “data is the new oil” has come to a reality. In our paper we presented a method to model the global financial markets interaction with networks and predict their future direction. We showed that using historical data of each market alone is not enough for prediction while the markets interact with each other in a global financial ecosystem.
Between 250 CE and 1530 CE, ancestral Purépecha people lived at the ancient city of Angamuco, a volcanic landform within the Lake Pátzcuaro Basin, central-western Mexico. Angamuco is located near Tzintzuntzan, the capital of the Purépecha Empire (1350-1530 CE), and is thus an important case study for examining the impacts of political change on people living at one site. Information from ceramic artifacts excavated at Angamuco indicate that residents were using similar recipes to make pottery before and during empire formation. This suggests that broader political changes do not always manifest at the scale of local craft production.
In this paper a general structure is presented for an Interval Type-2 (IT2) fuzzy two-term controller of Takagi-Sugeno (TS) type using a novel configuration. The general structure provides flexibility in controller design. The proposed structure is general in the sense that the user can select any number of fuzzy sets and the shape (triangular or trapezoidal) of their membership functions. The structure can be directly plugged in to control different dynamical systems by simply tuning the parameters of the fuzzy controller. This controller can be used much similar to the conventional (linear) two-term controllers but with better performance than its counterparts (linear and type-1 fuzzy controllers).
The key factor in selecting appropriate forecasting model is accuracy. Given the deficiencies of single models in processing various patterns latent in data, hybrid approaches have been known as promising techniques to achieve more accurate results. The main goal of this paper is to analyze hybrid structures by surveying more than 150 papers employed various hybrid models in time series modeling and forecasting domains. In this paper, the classification of hybrid models is made based on three main combination structures: parallel, series, and parallel-series. Then, reviewed papers are analyzed comprehensively with respect to their specific features of employed hybrid structure
Marine wood borers live in large aggregations with the ability to reproduce and grow rapidly, causing extensive damage to wooden underwater cultural heritage (UCH). Hence, the need to protect UCH is paramount, and understanding environmental conditions and species abundance is essential to identifying high risk sites. The study assessed the rate of degradation on UCH sites in different marine environments by deploying wooden test panels. Upon recovery, test panels were photographed, X-rayed and degradation was recorded with CAD software. Results indicated sediment type and coverage was a key factor controlling abundance of marine wood borers and the rate of biodegradation.
The work presents a hybrid version of evolution-based Genetic Algorithm (GA) with society-based Cohort Intelligence (CI) Algorithm. It is referred to as adaptive range GA. The population of chromosomes in GA undergo different operations such as Selection and Crossover. Some of the fittest chromosomes are probabilistically chosen to undergo a mutation characterized by sampling interval shrinking approach of CI. This significantly enhanced the local search ability of GA. The authors have validated this algorithm by solving a variety of test problems. The practical applicability of the algorithm is demonstrated by designing three distinct cases of Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger.
Brain areas in the non-dominant hemisphere (usually the right) are generally regarded as not crucial for language-related functions. Our results, however, indicated the existence of memory-related function in the amygdala in this hemisphere. The drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with amygdala lesion (AL) in the right hemisphere without hippocampal sclerosis (HS) exhibited noticeable decline of Working Memory (WM) compared with the TLE-HS patients. We also revealed that glucose hypometabolism was minimal for the right TLE-AL patients. Our results suggest that presurgical counseling regarding a possibility of postsurgical cognitive deficit would benefit the surgical candidates.
Inspired by the information exchange behavior of ants, we propose three extended pheromone-based prediction models to forecast the occurrence of traffic congestion. The first model is an algorithmic model while the other two are machine learning-based models. Compared to the existing pheromone-based models, these developed models allow forecasting ever-changing traffic conditions on vehicular systems composed of both signalized and non-signalized intersections. Additionally, the proposed models capture the dynamic traffic behaviour by considering all red, yellow and green phases. Experiments demonstrate the proposed models outperform existing pheromone-based approaches by achieving higher forecasting accuracy.
Los Bifaces site comprises an assemblage of at least 11 bifaces that were recovered on a surface of 2 m². They show intermediate stages of manufacture and would have been deposited at the same time and in a grouped manner. The high percentage of intentional fractures should be noted. Los Bifaces site is understood as a cache formed during the first moments of the settlement of the Tar and San Martín glacial lakes basin, and fractures are related to a ritual behavior. This broadens the considerations on caching and hunter-gatherer occupations in southern Patagonia.
Obsidian is a unique raw material exploited in the Paleolithic because it allows to researchers to define distances of raw material transport and inter regional contacts in different periods. Its chemical composition is unique for each eruptive event. Numerous sources of obsidian are known in the Southern and Lesser Caucasus, but only one source called Zayukovo (Baksan) is known in the Northern Caucasus. Doronicheva and co-authors report new data about exploitation of this source during the Palaeolithic. This is the largest series of Palaeolithic obsidian artefacts ever analyzed for the region. The research indicates contacts between different regions in the Caucasus in the Middle, Upper and Epipaleolithic.
This paper addresses sequential hypothesis testing for Markov models of time-series data by using the concepts of symbolic dynamics. The study is motivated by time-critical detection problems in physical processes, where a temporal model is trained to make fast and reliable decisions with streaming data. The technique guarantees that the test will terminate in finite time. The underlying algorithms are first illustrated through an example by numerical simulation, and are subsequently validated on time-series data of pressure oscillations from a laboratory-scale swirl-stabilized combustor apparatus to detect the onset of thermo-acoustic instability with fewer observations in comparison to a fixed-sample-size test.
Information about the mobility patterns and exchange networks of past societies can be generated by tracing the origin of the raw materials from which tools were made. Silcrete was often used to make tools but it has proven difficult to link silcrete artefacts with their locations of origin due to the heterogeneous composition of this rock. This paper reports the results of a pilot study of the Pb-isotope composition of silcrete outcrops in the Willandra Lakes region, Australia. Patterned variation in these data demonstrates the potential of this novel technique for linking silcrete artefacts to their locations of origin.
Diatoms detection and identification is a essential procedure for water quality assessment. However, the automatic segmentation of these species is still a challenge in computer vision. In this work, novel deep learning approaches are applied to predict exactly the image pixels that belong to a certain class. A comparison between semantic and instance segmentation techniques is carried out to detect and quantify diatoms of 10 different classes. This is the first time that the use of deep learning approaches is demonstrated for the identification and quantification of diatoms on images with multiple diatom shells and for more than one class.
The no-wait constraint widely exists in real production environments, e.g. steel-making industry and concrete manufacturing. The no-wait job shop problem with total flow time minimization is formulated asa mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model and decomposed into timetabling and sequencing subproblems. A population-based iterated greedy (PBIG) algorithm is proposed. In the algorithm, individuals evolve in parallel by means of a destruction and construction perturbator and an insertion-based local search. Computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art metaheuristics.
We report a case of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) confirmed by skin biopsy. This patient developed non-convulsive status epilepticus with generalized periodic discharges on electroencephalography after slowly progressive cognitive decline. To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of NIID with non-convulsive status epilepticus. Since adult patients with NIID display a wide variety of clinical manifestations, skin biopsy should be considered in patients who have leukoencephalopathy of unknown origin. When NIID patients display impaired consciousness, cognitive decline as well as the possible association with NCSE should be taken into account to ensure adequate anti-seizure drugs have been administered.
We use a variety of techniques to identify a raw material called Tertiary Hills Clinker that was used to make stone tools for over 10,000 years in northern Canada. We then match geochemical fingerprints of artifacts and source outcrop materials to demonstrate that Tertiary Hills Clinker was exchanged over an area of 1.25 million km². The way that people utilized Tertiary Hills Clinker changed after a large-scale volcanic eruption about 1200 years ago. We argue that the volcanic ash and its ecological impact fragmented pre-contact relationships, which may have stimulated one of the largest migrations of hunter-gatherers in North America.
Repair and maintenance services are among the most lucrative aspects of the entire automobile business chain, but facing a serious customer churn problem in China for numerous 4S shops. A six-year dataset is studied. First, the absence and presence behaviors are defined and generated according to customer behavior patterns. Second, absence and presence behaviors are modeled as a whole from a lifecycle perspective, where a novel recurrent neural network is proposed and customized with behavior features and business insights. Model performs excellent in both prediction and efficiency. At last, targeted CRM strategies and managerial insights are proposed.
The Late Viking Age Swedish runestones have long been assumed to be Christian monuments, with supposedly older runestones appearing in early Christianised regions. We used geostatistical methods to analyse the spatial relationships between runestone age and independent indicators of Christianisation to test whether the obtained patterns mirror the timing of the Christianisation process. Our results confirm that the runestones are suitable indicators of Christianisation: the runestones are significantly older close to other indicators of early Christianisation. Runestone age allows for the mapping of the spread of Christianity in Sweden, and we can identify seven distinct runestone-age regions.
Chemical composition and microstructural analyses were jointly applied to determining the provenance of the ceramic samples excavated from the Dong Xia sites in Russia's Primorye region. The Ancient Ceramic Database of Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences provided the data of the reference wares for comparison. Seventeen samples were confirmed as the Ding ware, Jun-series ware and Ru ware respectively. The Ru ware is identified for the first time in the Dong Xia sites. This research is a successful case of interdisciplinary cooperation in the medieval archaeometry of the Far East.
In recent years, an increasing number of reports have indicated an association between amygdala enlargement (AE) and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, the etiology of AE remains unknown. Here, we report a case involving an adult female patient with TLE-AE characterized by late-onset seizures and cognitive impairment. Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antibodies were detected in her cerebrospinal fluid. However, administration of appropriate anti-seizure drugs, without immunotherapy, improved her clinical symptoms. Moreover, reduction in the volume of AE was observed on MRI. We believe that our patient presented with a milder form or “forme fruste” of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.
The ‘Euphrates Monochrome Painted Ware’ is a ceramic style attested along the Middle Euphrates in northern Syria at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age, ca. 2900 – 2700 BCE. Despite this ware has been extensively studied from a typological perspective, its technology was never characterised. We apply a combination of macroscopic observations, ceramic petrography and micro X-ray diffraction (μ-XRD2) to study the material from Tell el-‘Abd, a small mound now beneath the modern Lake Assad (North Syria). The results allow to elucidate the provenance and manufacture of this ware, and to define the pigments used for the painted decoration.
A perennial challenge for archaeologists is locating the multiple components of archaeological sites, which can have uneven visibility and be spread across large distances. In this paper, we present the results of advances in drone-acquired imagery alongside historical aerial photography to detect previously unknown and widely dispersed archaeological features at Middle Grant Creek, a late prehistoric village (c. 1600 CE) at Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, Illinois. We detected probable housing and ritual areas and propose an expansion of the site from 3.4ha to 20ha. These findings contextualize ongoing archaeological excavations and expand how archaeologists can identify and investigate archaeological landscapes.
From the mid-2nd c. BC glass tableware became an abundant consumer good for the inhabitants of the structures excavated under the House of Orpheus. This observation correlates with the commercial boom in the late Hellenistic period within the eastern Mediterranean due to the increasingly growing impact of Rome on trade. The promising results from the combined archaeological, optical and chemical analyses demonstrates the great potential of a large-scale research project defining the different glass groups and different glass recipes in relation to specific vessel types of the Hellenistic and early Roman period, which can eventually be linked to specific glass workshops.
Salient object detection aims at localizing the most interesting and prominent parts of an image, and it is an effective pre-processing step for many computer vision tasks. Accurately detecting salient objects in complicated scenarios is still a challenge in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time salient object detection model which is able to adaptively weight feature maps from different scales and different levels of abstraction. In addition, our Sharpening Loss function guides our network to output saliency maps with higher certainty and less blurry salient objects, and it has far better performance than the Cross-entropy loss.
Traditional data-driven fault prognostic approaches face the challenge of dealing with incomplete and noisy data collected at irregular time steps, e.g. in correspondence of the occurrence of triggering events at the system level. Two strategies based on the use of ensembles of Echo State Networks (ESNs), properly adapted to deal with data collected at irregular time steps, are proposed to this aim. A synthetic and a real-world case study are used to show their effectiveness and their superior performance with respect to state-of-the-art prognostic methods.
Short messages as a reliable and personal means of mobile users’ communications have clearly contributed to the increasing number of unwanted messages globally. This study reviews the different soft techniques used in combating these spam messages. An qualitative analysis was conducted on the various SMS spam state of the art methodology. Focus was also given to the various AI methods and techniques proposed by previous researchers and highlight of the strength and weakness of these proposed techniques were addressed. Interesting research questions were prepared and their answers gave an eye-opening discovery for further research endeavours
This paper presents a new bio-inspired optimization algorithm, named Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (MRFO), based on intelligent behaviors of manta rays. MRFO is a swarm-based technique that simulates three unique foraging strategies of manta rays, including chain foraging, cyclone foraging, and somersault foraging. The performance of MRFO is assessed with thirty-one benchmark optimization functions and eight engineering design problems. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method is far superior to other state-of-the-art optimizers, especially for the real-world engineering applications, MRFO is more competitive in terms of computational expense and solution precision.
In this paper, we introduce a super-fast supervised machine learning method, namely stochastic parallel extreme artificial hydrocarbon networks, or simply SPE-AHN. This model includes a simple batch learning process for consuming large amounts of data while training an artificial hydrocarbon network using nature-inspired optimization in parallel. In machine learning for large and big data, it requires novel solutions on model scalability, predictive power and fast training time. Thus, our method provides an alternative to this challenging problem. We anticipate our new method will be useful in many data-driven applications using large amounts of data, like in robotics, finance, health, aerospace, and many others.
The late antique/early medieval age in Central Italy is a well-suited context to verify the implications of the end of the natron glass supplies, and to explore the beginnings of the new plant-ash glass technology. We present the results of a LA-ICP-MS analysis campaign conducted on archaeological glass finds excavated at the Santa Maria della Scala hospital site in Siena and in Donoratico. The collected samples fit well within known late Roman glass classifications (e.g. HIMT, Levantine). Trace element analysis provided further information on the raw materials that were used, which provided information on the glassmaking and the colouring processes.
This paper describes the Later Mesolithic stone tools collected in the 1940s by the avocational archaeologist Gwendoline Stacpoole from farm fields in the vicinity of Kenure, Co. Dublin, Ireland. Made by the last hunter-gatherers in Ireland, these stone tools were produced quickly using locally available raw materials and this collection generally lacks evidence for any specialized stone tool manufacture techniques. In these respects, the Later Mesolithic stone tools from Kenure are similar to those found elsewhere in Ireland. In general, the stone tool evidence seems to suggest that Ireland’s last hunter-gatherers occupied relatively stable campsites along coasts and interior waterways.
Credit card companies and banks use credit scores to evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers and, therefore, mitigating losses due to bad debt. Within the financial technology domain, an ideal approach should be able to operate proactively, without the need of knowing the behavior of non-reliable users. Actually, this does not happen because the most-used techniques need to train their models with both reliable and non-reliable data. In this paper, we propose a proactive approach, composed of a combined entropy-based method that is trained considering only reliable cases and the sample under investigation.
The Par-Tee site (35CLT20), located on the northern Oregon Coast, is a large archaeological collection excavated in the 1960s and 1970s. Radiocarbon dates have been obtained on materials from the Par-Tee collection by researchers since the 1970s, but these data have not been assessed for chronometric hygiene. To establish a reliable chronology for the Par-Tee site, we obtained new high-resolution accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates and collagen peptide mass fingerprinting of cervid bones. We evaluate the new radiocarbon dates along with previous radiocarbon dates from the site, using chronometric hygiene assessments and Bayesian statistics to build a refined chronology.
The chu-nam putty excavated from the Ming Dynasty site of Baochuangchang Shipyard was analyzed. The results proved that the putty was quite compact and mainly consisted of calcite, quartz and carboxylates. Tung oil was applied as waterproofing agent and the mixture of jute was used to prevent it from crack. It was well preserved and possesses good sealing property which could ensure long-time oversea voyage. These overall revealed the shipbuilding skills of the Baochuanchang Shipyard. It may also provide reference for studying Zheng He’s vessels and make contributions to the conservation of ancient wooden ships of the Ming Dynasty.
This paper discusses the search for new rock-shelter containing Final Palaeolithic archaeology sites in the German Federal State of Hesse. In finding new settlements of late ice age hunter-gatherers and volcanic ash of the Laacher See eruption, the project seeks to investigate the effects of this potentially catastrophic event 13.000 years ago. By employing an archaeological predictive model in combination with a legacy database of potential rock-shelters, a set of locations was determined which will be subject to subsequent fieldwork. In this article, we are presenting the model, its performance and selected locations for first keyhole field investigations.
Solving engineering problems is a complex and critical task therefore in this context, many studies have been performed. This study presents a modified version of Multi-Verse Optimizer is proposed by using the chaos theory and the Harris Hawks Optimization. The proposed method is evaluated over global optimization problems then applied to solve some of the well-known engineering problems. The proposed method showed good performance compared the other methods and traditional approach.
Scientific discoveries often describe the behavior of dynamical systems with equations. Systems typically have components and their behavior is a result of interactions between these components. We present an artificial intelligence method for discovering equations from measurements. The method approaches equation discovery as a task of combinatorial search for an optimal combination of equation fragments, where each fragment describes an interaction in the modeled system. We explore the efficiency of different search techniques for discovering equation-based models of population and biochemical dynamics, and explain their relative performance by analyzing the properties of the space of equations they search.
Self-reported consumption of cannabis is relatively common in patients with epilepsy. The impact of chronic cannabis use on Wada (intracarotid amobarbital) testing (IAT), to localize speech and memory functions in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery, has not previously been described. We present a case series of patients who were chronic cannabis users and underwent IAT both before and after a period of enforced abstinence. These cases demonstrate a need for prospective studies that more formally assess the impact of cannabis use on IAT. Of particular interest may be the impact of cannabis products with varying ratios of canabidiol (CBD) to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
Suppose you have an inexpensive process that you have many copies of, and where each requires feedback control to achieve good closed-loop performance (e.g., the cruise control for an automobile). There is then a feedback controller design challenge for each process (car). The traditional approach to such a design is to use linear or nonlinear methods for one copy of the process (one car) and implement the designed controller on each copy of the process (all cars manufactured). The hope is that the original design is robust so it performs well on all copies. Here, we assume that the processes can be connected on the internet of things and introduce a novel strategy to design, in a distributed fashion, controllers for each process where the design of the controller for each plant is informed by the success of the designs of all other controllers (i.e., our approach automatically constructs the algorithms for all cars to perform the best). We show that a type of robust controller can be designed over the internet of things. Our methods hold promise in many practical commercial applications.
We introduce an aerial-aquatic coaxial eight-rotor to complete an underwater target track task from air to underwater. The vehicle should adjust the angular velocities of rotors to realize a smooth diving process. When the vehicle navigates underwater, the navigation information is provided only by INS. We establish the inaccurate navigation information model and applies it to collision detection and cost function setting in the trajectory optimization. We improve the TLBO algorithm referring to PSO algorithm by modifying the formula of updating academic records in the teaching procedures. The convergence rate and the solution quality are both improved.
The term Epileptic Spasms (ES) refers to a severe seizure disorder that often presents in infancy with a characteristic EEG pattern known as hypasarrythmia. ES has many causes, many of which involve structural changes to the brain. We describe an infant with in utero Zika virus infection, a virus known to disrupt fetal brain development, who develops ES. We review changes to the infant’s brain structure and EEG patterns and discuss the response to treatment. In addition to illustrating the links between brain structure and function, this case reaffirms the importance of monitoring infants with congenital infections for ES development.
While LiDAR has proven to provide detailed topographic information in heavily forested environments, tools for efficiently processing these data are needed. Machine learning algorithms offer a means of systematically isolating features that have topographic signatures consistent with archaeological deposits. We compare four methods for automated identification of archaeological earthwork structures (i.e., mounds and rings) from LiDAR datasets. Our findings show that a combination of algorithms that combine aspects of size and shape profiles with statistical correlations are the most successful in identifying archaeological deposits that also minimize the incidence of false positives.
Newly emerging location-based social network (LBSN) services provide us with new platforms to share interests and individual experience. The problems of data sparsity and user distrust in LBSNs create a severe challenge for traditional recommender systems. Moreover, users' behaviors in LBSNs show an obvious spatio-temporal pattern. Valuable extra information from microblog-based social networks (MBSNs) can be utilized to improve the effectiveness of POI suggestion. We propose a model to fulfill the top-$k$ suggestion based on the fused data of LBSNs and MBSNs. Extensive experiments on two real geo-social networks show the superiority of our model.
Very little is known about the Epiclassic period in relation to the other cultures but very important since it is giving rise to the conformation of the cultures which follow. Lake Xaltocan is in the Basin of Mexico and geographically near to Teotihuacan´s site. More than a hundredth of skulls of sacrificed people were found in Postclassic Xaltocan. Until now it has been mostly accepted, in the anthropological community, that the inhabitants of the Postclassic Xaltocan were conformed by migrations from Teotihuacan decline. Our study through genetic inherit characters makes clear that the group of sacrificed people does not belong from Teotihuacan.
Proposals about the intentional breakage and exchange of fragments of anthropomorphic terracotta figurines can be investigated via instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of their chemical composition. INAA of 93 Preclassic (~1000–400 BCE) fragments from two Maya sites in Petén, Guatemala, identified five compositional groups, and left eight unassigned. All artifacts but one are thought to have been produced in the lakes region around the two sites, but only five fragments suggest intra- and inter-site circulation. These findings provide scant support for exchange and ‘enchainment’ of early Maya figurine fragments, as suggested in other parts of the world.
Although consciousness is commonly impaired in epileptic seizures, limited literature is available on loss of consciousness induced by electrical cortical stimulation (ECS) in humans undergoing intracranial EEG evaluations for localization of epileptic focus. One theory advocates the presence of consciousness ‘switch’ in subcortical structures. While this model is novel and simplistic, it has its inherent limitations. In this case study, we propose an alternative approach on the entity and discuss the complex circuits underlying it and correlate that with the electrophysiological findings and the pathophysiology of the phenotype of the disease and discuss potential causes for rarity of reports on the subject.
This study evaluates and compares several microscopic age estimation formulae and standard macroscopic age estimates for a population of prehispanic Maya at Xcambó, Mexico. Differences between estimates provide interesting insights into the applicability of histological age assessment in archaeological material. Results support the use of regionally adjusted formulae for age estimation, but also encourage future exploration regarding microstructural variation in population samples linked to lifestyle and other regional factors.
Person re-identification refers to the problem of identifying a person of interest across a network of cameras. This task is specially required by surveillance applications for security systems in public areas such as airports and train stations. For a real-world person re-identification application, in order to guarantee a timely response, it is crucial to find the balance between accuracy and response time. We analyse this trade-off, by comparing classical machine learning methods, with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Additionally, we propose and analyse network distillation as a learning strategy to reduce the computational cost of deep learning architectures at test time.
This article proposes an algorithm that optimizes the routes of several Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that search for targets with uncertain locations and dynamics as fast as possible. The proposed ant colony based algorithm incorporates communication and collision avoidance constraints, ensuring that the UAVs are able to complete the search mission without colliding or losing communication with the ground control station. This approach is highly relevant nowadays, because UAV flight regulations often entail monitoring the state of the UAVs during the whole mission, requiring UAV deployments with continuous communication to the ground control station.
The quality of meat products (pig hams and loins) is traditionally assessed by chemical or sensorial analysis, which are time consuming, need specialized technicians and destroy the products. We use Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), computer vision (texture features) and machine learning (regression models) to predict 39 meat attributes. For most of them, the performance is good or excellent with a weighted absolute error below 2% and without statistically significant differences between predicted and true values. This automatic system could reliably predict the quality of meat pieces operating on-line in the meat industries in the future.
Different funeral traditions might have coexisted in European prehistory. One rite is traditionally considered dominant or “normative” since it is more visible in the archaeological record, the other(s) is (are) termed less dominant or “deviant”. Burial rites changed and transformed in time. The 2nd millennium BCE in Central Europe is characterized by dramatic transformation in both the dominant and the less dominant burial rite as reflected by changing practices of body processing. Cremation, bone modification with tools, and fragmentation started to prevail in funeral traditions. The aim was possibly a quick defleshing of the body for bone curation.
Rovers are currently exploring other planets. Thus, this paper proposes a novel path planning algorithm that allows them to autonomously reach places of scientific interest in an efficient way. The objective is to minimize the energy required to reach a goal position. The proposed algorithm considers the use of multiple modes of locomotion, which is a characteristic of reconfigurable rovers. Moreover, this algorithm can merge satellite maps, whose resolution is limited, with detailed maps of the rover surroundings built upon its sensory information. This is useful for recalculating the path to avoid obstacles non detected in the initial satellite maps.
This unique assemblage of over 50 items from the Middle Bronze Age in Israel (17th–16th century BCE) includes many items such as pestles, a grinding stone, pounders and smooth worn pebbles that were clearly used for preparing powders. The assemblage includes some of the raw materials used for the powders, such as a red material composed of clay and an iron oxide, white chalk and black charcoal. Amazingly the “toolkit” components were found arranged in the way that they had been deliberately packed into a small pit about 3600 years ago. We do not however know what the colored powders were used for.
The oldest-ever archaeological evidence for brewing barley/wheat beer was recently found in Raqefet Cave (a prehistoric site in Mt. Carmel, Israel). Our excavations and ensuing contextual, micro-botanical and use-wear analyses of stone mortars found hewn into the floor of the cave indicate that the local Natufian foragers stored plant-foods – including malted wheat or barley – in fiber-made containers that were set in deep stone mortars. The barley/wheat-based beer likely served in ritual and burial feasts 13,000 years ago. Such sophisticated use of cereals predates their domestication and indicated their use not only as staples for consumption.
Data from the last hunter-gatherer communities is available through the study of the Late Mesolithic site Monte do Carrascal 2, in Portugal. The archaeological excavation revealed a hunter-gather hunting camp composed of a set of lithics remains associated with two hearths, one of them with auroch remains. The lithics analysis showed the exploitation of local raw- materials to produce flakes, bladelets and several tools. The GIS spatial analysis revealed an anthropic origin of the remains location. The importance of Carrascal is connected to its inland location differing to the contemporary sites riverine location such as Sado and Muge shell middens.
Unverricht–Lundborg disease (ULD) is an autosomal recessive progressive myoclonic epileptic disorder characterized by onset at the age of 6–15 years, severe incapacitating stimulus-sensitive progressive myoclonus, tonic–clonic epileptic seizures, absence seizures and characteristic abnormalities in the electroencephalogram. Neuropsychiatric disturbances like depression and anxiety and cognitive impairment are a recognized feature of Unverricht-Lundborg disease. However the unique social features seen in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) may not be a recognized feature of ULD. We found autistic (mainly social or behavioral) features in three patients of ULS and concluded that identifying autism in ULD patients could be important.
During the Magdalenian, the hunter-gatherers established their settlements in the south-eastern Pyrenees (Iberian Peninsula). The region is characterized by rocky landscapes, mountain reliefs and river courses, which have shaped the reliefs. During the Upper Pleistocene, montane pines were the main tree cover, an essential wood resource for use as fuel. To evaluate the settlement patterns of archaeological sites set according to their chrono-cultural phase, we have studied, for first time, the territory around the sites through the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis. The quantitative analysis of territorial variables suggests common diachronic changes in the territorial characteristics for each chrono-cultural phase.
Measures of site location in relation to agricultural potential are an important tool for identifying relative shifts in the importance of agriculture in prehistoric economies over time. We examine GIS modeling of agricultural potential based on soil characteristics, topography, and proximity to drainage in the highlands of the Mogollon culture of southcentral New Mexico. We describe methods, limitations, and advantages of this approach. Preliminary results support other evidence of strong agricultural reliance in the pithouse period, substantially greater than in the Archaic; the pueblo period may be slightly more linked to optimal agricultural land, though the latter conclusion is uncertain.
Cova Bonica has yielded one of the few assemblages of Cardial Neolithic records of directly dated human remains (5470 and 5220 yr. cal. BC) in the Iberian Peninsula. A minimum of seven individuals have been ascribed on the basis of the disarticulated human bones. The paper concludes that the funerary and ritualistic practices of the Cardial Neolithic are difficult to reconstruct because human remains are often scattered in archaeological layers where other activities may also have been conducted. Only a multi-proxy analysis of the archaeological material is capable of evaluating different processes and their associated activities.
Modifications to human bones from six underground tombs in Malta, dated to between 3500-2450 BC, have been analysed to identify their origin. Due to the size and shape of the modifications, they are shown to be the result of dermestid beetle feeding damage and burrowing. Since dermestid beetles would not have originally been present in the tombs, these results advance our understanding of funerary practices in Neolithic Malta. Analysis of the human remains indicates most individuals were buried soon after death. We argue that the beetles were transported into the tombs, perhaps in hide wrappings, during the burial process.
Malware analysis is fundamental to create and maintain reliable cyber-security systems capable of countering different threats. In the context of dynamic analysis, malware often remain hidden until a specific triggering action is performed by the user. SECUR-AMA is an Active Malware Analysis (AMA) framework for Android that mimics what a security expert does when analyzing a malware: it performs actions on the system, triggering malicious responses to generate a behavioral model of the application. SECUR-AMA learns from past interactions to guide the analysis aiming at maximizing the information that can be acquired on the malware while minimizing the number of triggering actions.
Based on the normalized Minkowski distance in Hausdorff metrics, we study the sensitivity of interval-valued Schweizer-Sklar t-norms and their corresponding residual implications. Moreover, we investigate the robustness of interval-valued fuzzy reasoning triple I algorithms based on Schweizer-Sklar operators and illustrate the feasibility of the algorithms by a numerical example. Finally, the interval-valued fuzzy reasoning triple I algorithms are applied to medical diagnosis.
Analysis of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes is regularly used to reconstruct diet in the past. While bone samples provide averaged results from the last several years of an individual’s life, incremental dentine provides higher resolution of an earlier age. We found bone profiles between two demographically and temporally different burial populations from Medieval Hereford were statistically similar. By comparing them with canine and third molar dentine profiles of five individuals from one of the two sites, we found considerable variability and evidence to suggest that physiological processes during growth and development may influence the isotopic results.
Recent advances in artificial intelligence have improved perception of the world surrounding us. This progress is also important for development of medical systems, especially telemedicine solutions that are gaining more attention due to aging societies. The quality of images is a key factor for remote diagnostics based on computer vision. In our study we proposed a solution for improving resolution of thermal sequences and showed that in this way accuracy of facial areas detection, used for vital signs estimation, can be increased by 20%. This important finding can be potentially useful in areas like autonomous driving, remote healthcare, and more.
Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) is an anomaly of the part of the brain, which causes epileptic seizures. Medications frequently could not stop the seizures and surgical treatment is warranted. However, it is difficult to locate the exact regions that give rise to seizures in an indi-vidual patient and to operate them without damaging the surrounding brain. We describe a patient whose examination revealed that seizures were arising from PNH and neurons scattered within ad-jacent white matter. We used the minimally invasive procedure of laser ablation to target them. The patient is seizure free afterward with a normal level of functioning.
Premature convergence of metaheuristics is due to loss of promising search directions due to misguidance of highly dominant but locally optimal solutions extracted at early iterations. The method presented in this article employs a two-stage external memory of promising solutions such that the first stage acts as a short-term memory that is updated frequently as new promising solutions are extracted whereas the second stage acts as a long-term memory and provides alternative search directions experienced over a number of generations. The proposed method is implemented within the great Deluge algorithm’s framework and used for the solution numerical multiobjective optimization problems.
This paper proposes to use Decentralized Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to alleviate the effects of the curse of dimensionality on the action space, and to use transfer knowledge to reduce the training episodes. Three DRL schemes are compared and analyzed in two complex real-world problems performed with humanoid biped robots. The obtained results show the effectiveness of DRL systems, which even without prior-coordination are able to achieve asymptotic convergence throughout indirect coordination. By using the proposed methods is possible to reduce the training episodes, and to coordinate the DRL process
Technology has influenced our anatomical and cognitive capacities, and human hand is functionally specialized for manipulation. In terms of cognition, tools are integrated into the body scheme when handled. Stone tools can supply information on the evolution of this reciprocal relationship. In this survey, we investigate basic patterns associated with hand-tool morphometrics. Results on three different tool types suggest that tool length influences the grasping pattern more than hand dimensions. Hand-tool morphometrics can provide information to support ergonomic and cognitive perspectives in technological extension and cognitive archaeology.
As tactical plans of complex rail operations, train timetables are programmed and updated every year or every season because of remarkable variation of passenger demands. From the optimization perspective, this paper aims to investigate a detailed description and optimal methods (a two-stage stochastic integer programming model and corresponding heuristic algorithm) to efficiently obtain a near-optimal timetable and passenger allocation of trains’ capacity under the fluctuation of daily passenger demands. Through implementing on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail network in China, we verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed methods.
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an artificial intelligence technique which, like the human brain, works on feedback gathered from trials and errors. The actor-critic is a type of RL algorithm in which one of the algorithm’s parameters, called the actors, become very large in magnitude, causing the computer to crash. Therefore, this algorithm fails on large-scale industrial-strength cases. We develop a new actor-critic algorithm in which the computer crash is avoided, allowing the algorithm to deliver solutions on large-scale problems. We test the algorithm on large-scale airline pricing problems, where it performs better than a very popular industrial technique called EMSR-b.
Advanced neuroimaging techniques are increasingly being implemented in clinical practice. Here we present a case report of an 18-year-old patient with autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy caused by heterozygous mutation in RELN gene. 3T MRI brain scan and advanced neuroimaging methods were used in the standard protocols to analyse voxel-based MRI, cortical thickness, and functional connectivity. The functional connectivity analysis revealed higher local synchrony in the left temporal, left frontal, and left parietal regions and the cingulate. Evidence of multiple areas of functional connectivity confirm the theory of epileptogenic networks in ADTLE. Connectivity abnormalities have potential for clinical relevance and correlation.
Laugerie-Haute is a famous UNESCO World Heritage listed limestone rockshelter in southwest France. It has an important sequence of Paleolithic cultures, especially the Solutrean and the so-called “Aurignacian V”. Despite its long history of research starting in the 1860s, the exact timing of human occupation was not clear. A new series of radiocarbon samples was taken from one of the preserved sections to improve our understanding. The results indicate that the sequence was deposited between 28,000 and 19,000 years ago and confirm the stratigraphic integrity of the site. In addition, the first dates for the “Aurignacian V” in southwest France place this rare phenomenon approximately 26,000 years ago. The results strengthen the existing chronological framework for this part of ice age Europe.
This article presents the second study of ochres associated with the Lower Magdalenian “Red Lady” human burial (18,700 years old) in El Mirón Cave (Cantabria, Spain). By means of instrumental techniques, the origin of the specially prepared idiomorphic hematite in the burial layer and painted on a large, engraved block adjacent to it was shown to be an outcrop 27 km from the site on the Atlantic coast (Santoña). Similar analyses show that the ochre used to stain the nearby cave wall adjacent to an engraved horse image is different in composition, as are other ochres in the Magdalenian occupations.
Human primary hepatocytes were reprogrammed towards hepatic progenitor cells by a combined treatment with 2 small molecules, A83-01 and CHIR99021, and HGF. Chemically derived hepatic progenitors exhibited a high proliferation potential and the ability to differentiate into hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells both in vitro and in vivo. This approach enables the generation of patient-specific hepatic progenitors and provides a platform for personal and stem cell-based regenerative medicine.
In chronic hepatitis B virus infection, natural killer (NK)-cell phenotype and function is altered. In this study, we demonstrate that these changes are linked to the emergence of a distinct NK-cell subset, namely memory-like NK cells. The emergence of these memory-like NK cells is associated with coinfection of human cytomegalovirus that affects the majority of patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Acute liver failure is a rapidly progressive deterioration of liver function resulting in high mortality. In experimental mouse models of acute liver failure, we found that two metabolic enzymes, namely pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and lactic dehydrogenase, translocate to the nucleus resulting in detrimental gene expression. Treatment with an inhibitor of these two enzymes was found to reduce liver damage and to improve survival.
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are among signals frequently deregulated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and their deregulation confers essential biological properties to cancer cells. We have applied a genetic method to randomly mutate large numbers of genes in the context of a mouse model with increased RTK levels, predisposed to develop liver cancer. We identified mechanisms that accelerate tumour formation in cooperation with enhanced RTK levels. The wide array of cellular functions among these cooperators illustrates an extraordinary capability of RTKs to render the liver more vulnerable to additional alterations, by priming cells for tumour initiation.
Patients with cirrhosis of the liver are at risk of getting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC or liver cancer) and therefore it is recommended that they undergo surveillance for HCC. However, the risk of HCC varies dramatically in patients with cirrhosis, which has implications on if and how patients get surveillance, how providers counsel patients about the need for surveillance, and how healthcare systems approach and prioritize surveillance. We used readily available predictors to develop models estimating HCC risk in patients with cirrhosis, which are available as web-based tools at www.hccrisk.com.
Exhaustion of CD8+ T cells is an important factor in the development of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. CD8+ T cells expressing the receptor CXCR5 are partially exhausted, but have potent antiviral activity, as they produce high levels of HBV-specific cytokines in chronic HBV infection. Increased expression of CXCL13 within the liver facilitates the recruitment of CXCR5+CD8+T cells and establishes effective immune control of HBV infection.
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is a combination of two drugs in one tablet that is approved for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. When patients with chronic HCV infection receive a liver transplant, the HCV infection usually recurs, and damages the transplanted liver. This study tested the effects of 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment in patients who had HCV recurrence after a liver transplant. Three months following the end of treatment, 96% of patients were cured of HCV infection.
Liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma in advanced cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B score) is associated with a high rate of postoperative complications. However, due to the limited therapeutic alternatives in this setting, recent studies have shown promising results after accurate patient selection. In our international multicenter study, we provide 3 clinical models to predict postoperative surgical risks and long-term survival following liver resection, with the aim of improving treatment allocation and eventually clinical outcomes.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a cholestatic liver disease characterized by progressive bile duct destruction. One serious complication of PSC is reduced bone mass resulting in increased fracture risk. Herein, we demonstrate that Th17 cells mediate bone loss in PSC by inducing bone resorption, which suggests that antibody-based IL-17 blockade might be beneficial for the treatment of bone loss in affected patients.
In phase III studies, 12 weeks of treatment with the combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX) cured 97% of patients with hepatitis C virus who failed prior treatment with direct-acting antiviral drugs. Herein, we show that the presence of pretreatment drug resistance did not affect treatment outcome in these patients who had previously received direct-acting antivirals. We also showed that new drug resistance was rare in patients who failed treatment with SOF/VEL/VOX for 12 weeks. This has important implications for the selection of best retreatment strategies for these patients.
There are now medications (direct-acting antivirals or “DAAs”) that can “cure” hepatitis C virus, but patients with hepatitis C and liver cancer may be less likely to achieve cure than those without liver cancer. However, patients with liver cancer are also more likely to have advanced liver disease and risk factors that can decrease cure rates, so better controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings.
An optimal allocation system for scarce resources should simultaneously ensure maximal utility, but also equity. While the model for end-stage liver disease is currently the standard for this model, many adjustments were implemented in most countries. A future globally applicable strategy should combine donor and recipient factors predicting probability of death on the waiting list, post-transplant survival and morbidity, and perhaps costs
Acute liver failure in children is a rare but devastating condition. Liver transplantation is the most effective treatment, but it has several important limitations. Liver cell (hepatocyte) transplantation is an attractive option, as many patients only require short-term liver support while their own liver recovers. Human hepatocytes encapsulated in alginate beads can perform the functions of the liver while alginate coating protects the cells from immune attack. Herein, we demonstrated that transplantation of these beads was safe and feasible in children with acute liver failure.
Our findings demonstrate that although reinfection by hepatitis C virus occurs following successful treatment in people with recent drug use, the rate of hepatitis C reinfection is lower than the rates of primary infection reported in the literature for this population – reinfection should not be used as a reason to withhold therapy from people with ongoing injecting drug use. The rate of hepatitis C reinfection was lowest among people receiving opioid agonist therapy with no recent drug use. These data illustrate that harm reduction services are required to reduce the reinfection risk, while regular post-treatment hepatitis C assessment is required for early detection and retreatment.
Surgical resection and radiofrequency ablation are both treatment options for perivascular hepatocellular carcinoma. We compared outcomes in patients treated with either method. Surgical resection provided better long-term tumor control and overall survival than radiofrequency ablation for patients with a small perivascular hepatocellular carcinoma (≤3 cm) as a first-line treatment, particularly for periportal tumors. The location of the tumor and the type of peritumoral hepatic vessels need to be considered when choosing between surgical resection and radiofrequency ablation for small HCCs
Mucin 13 overexpression has been implicated in the development of malignancies, although its role in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma has not been studied. Herein, we show that mucin 13 plays a critical role in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Mucin 13 could have therapeutic value both as a prognostic marker and as a treatment target.
B cells are best known for their capacity to produce antibodies, which often play a deleterious role in the development of autoimmune diseases. During chronic hepatitis C, self-reactive B cells proliferate and can be responsible for autoimmune symptoms (arthritis, purpura, neuropathy, renal disease) and/or lymphoma. Direct-acting antiviral therapy clears the hepatitis C virus and eliminates deleterious B cells.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent tumors worldwide and is correlated with a high mortality rate. In patients with HCC, lower expression of the enzyme OGDHL is significantly associated with worse survival. Herein, we show that silencing of OGDHL induces lipogenesis and influences the chemosensitization effect of sorafenib in liver cancer cells by reprogramming glutamine metabolism. OGDHL is a promising prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in OGDHL-negative liver cancer.
Patients with cirrhosis who are on the liver transplant waiting list often develop complications which prevent them from receiving a transplant. Circulatory dysfunction is a key factor behind a number of complications. This study was aimed at investigating whether treating patients with midodrine (a vasoconstrictor) and albumin would improve circulatory dysfunction and prevent complications. This combined treatment, at least at the doses administered in this study, did not prevent the complications of cirrhosis or improve the survival of these patients.
A functionally mature, human cell-based liver model exhibiting human responses in toxicity prediction and drug evaluation is urgently needed for pre-clinical drug development. Here, we develop a novel human pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like liver organoid that is critically advanced in terms of its generation method, functional performance, and application technologies. Our organoids can contribute to the better understanding of liver development and regeneration, and provide insights for metabolic studies and disease modeling, as well as toxicity assessments and drug screening for personalized medicine.
We aimed to determine whether direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) significantly improve overall survival in patients with hepatitis C virus-related compensated cirrhosis and a first diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) which has been successfully treated with curative resection or ablation. Using propensity-score matched patients, we found that DAAs improved overall survival and reduced the risk of hepatic decompensation. However, the risk of HCC recurrence was not significantly reduced.
Our present study identifies the essential role of the protein PSMP for the development and progression of liver fibrosis in humans and mice. PSMP promotes liver fibrosis through inflammatory macrophage infiltration, polarization and production of proinflammatory cytokines, as well as direct activation of hepatic stellate cells via its receptor CCR2. A PSMP antibody can significantly reduce liver fibrosis development in vivo. These findings indicate that PSMP is a potential therapeutic target and its antibody is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of liver fibrosis.
Activation of the nuclear bile acid receptor FXR regulates gene expression networks, controlling lipid, cholesterol and glucose metabolism, which are mostly effective after eating. Whether FXR exerts critical functions during fasting is unknown. The results of this study show that FXR transcriptional activity is regulated by the glucagon/protein kinase A and the FOXA2 signaling pathways, which act on FXR through phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions, respectively, to increase hepatic glucose synthesis.
Among all clinically relevant hepatitis C virus protease inhibitors, voxilaprevir and glecaprevir showed the highest and most uniform activity against cell culture infectious hepatitis C virus with genotype 1-6 proteases. Naturally occurring amino acid changes at protease position 80 had low fitness cost and influenced sensitivity to simeprevir, but not to other protease inhibitors in short-term treatment assays. Nevertheless, the pre-existing change Q80K had the potential to promote viral escape from protease inhibitors during long-term treatment by rapid co-selection of additional resistance changes, detected by next generation sequencing.
In this study, we identify that among patients with decompensated cirrhosis, class III obesity (severe/morbid obesity) is a modifiable risk factor for the development of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). We further demonstrate that regarding the specific organ failures associated with ACLF, renal failure is significantly more prevalent in obese patients, particularly those with class III obesity. These findings underscore the importance of weight management in cirrhosis, to reduce the risk of ACLF. Patients with class III obesity should be monitored closely for the development of renal failure.
Alcoholic liver disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent studies highlight the involvement of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism. Our study reveals that deficiency of sorting nexin (SNX) 10 increases the stability of LAMP-2A by inhibiting cathepsin A maturation, resulting in the increase of CMA activity and, thus, alleviates alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis.
In patients chronically infected with hepatitis B virus resistant to multiple drugs including lamivudine, entecavir, and/or adefovir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) monotherapy showed non-inferior efficacy compared with the combination therapy of TDF plus entecavir. Nonetheless, short-term TDF monotherapy was associated with suboptimal virologic response, and its long-term safety was uncertain. This study displayed that 240 weeks of TDF monotherapy provided a virologic response in most of those patients, but it was associated with poor serological responses and decreasing renal function and bone mineral density.
This study demonstrates that cells that are isolated from urine can be reprogrammed in a dish towards hepatocytes that display architectural characteristics similar to those seen in the intact liver. The application of this methodology to cells from patients diagnosed with inherited copper metabolism-related liver diseases (that is, Wilson disease and MEDNIK syndrome) revealed unexpected and novel insights into patient mutation-specific disease mechanisms and drug responses.
Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on the pathogenesis and progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of a genetic variant in the KLB gene on the severity of liver disease. Our data suggest that the KLB protein plays a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.
Patients who are immunosuppressed are vulnerable to developing chronic liver disease following infection with hepatitis E virus (HEV). To-date, there is no approved therapy for chronic hepatitis E. Interferon-α and ribavirin are off-label treatment options, but their applications are limited by side effects. Thus, immunotherapy, more specifically T cell-based therapy, may be an alternative approach. We designed T cell receptor-engineered T cells that effectively conferred immune cells, taken from patients with chronic hepatitis E, with the ability to recognize virus-specific epitopes and mediate killing of target cells in vitro.
About 15% of patients with idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension are women of childbearing age, who can become pregnant. As available reports on pregnancy in these women are scarce and heterogeneous, it is unclear whether or not pregnancy should be contraindicated in this setting. We provide detailed data showing that, regardless of the associated conditions, the overall outcome of women with idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension becoming pregnant is good despite a significant incidence of complications related to portal hypertension, and that fetal outcome is favorable in most pregnancies reaching 20 weeks of gestation.
The origins of HBV are unclear. The new orthohepadnavirus species from Brazilian capuchin monkeys resembled HBV in elicited infection patterns and could infect human liver cells using the same receptor as HBV. Evolutionary analyses suggested that primate HBV-related viruses might have emerged in African ancestors of New World monkeys millions of years ago. HBV was associated with hominoid primates, including humans and apes, suggesting evolutionary origins of HBV before the formation of modern humans. HBV genotypes found in American natives were divergent from those found in American monkeys, and likely introduced along prehistoric human migration. Our results elucidate the evolutionary origins and dispersal of primate HBV, identify a new orthohepadnavirus reservoir, and enable new perspectives for animal models of hepatitis B.
We assessed the safety and efficacy of public health care using no-cost all-oral generic direct-acting antiviral drugs against hepatitis C in the state of Punjab, India. The goal is elimination of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) by 2030 and involves primary care providers at 25 sites in the state. We enrolled 48,088 individuals (63.8% male; mean age 42.1 years; 80.5% rural; 14.8% compensated cirrhotic; 69.9% genotype 3) between 18th June 2016 to 31st July 2018. Cure was achieved in 91.6% of patients, demonstrating that decentralized care of CHC with generic all-oral regimens is safe and effective.
Hepatitis A virus, a common cause of acute hepatitis globally, is likely to have evolved from a virus that jumped from a rodent species to humans within the last 10–12 thousand years. Here we show that distantly related hepatoviruses, that infect bats and rodents today, express proteases that disrupt innate antiviral responses in human cells. This conserved attribute of hepatoviruses may have contributed to that ancient host species shift.
In this cohort of cirrhotic patients, interferon-free therapies achieved a high rate of sustained virologic response (>95%); however, we reported a risk of de novo hepatocellular carcinoma of 3.73 per 100 person-years and a clear-cut time association with antiviral therapy. The time association between starting direct-acting antivirals and developing hepatocellular carcinoma, together with the association with the presence of non-characterized nodules at baseline ultrasound, suggests that antiviral therapy elicits a mechanism (probably immune-related) that primes the growth and clinical recognition of hepatocellular carcinoma early during follow-up. As a result, short-term liver cancer risk is significantly increased.
In patients with liver cirrhosis, the risk of a hepatectomy is difficult to appreciate. We propose a statistical tool to estimate this risk, preoperatively and immediately after surgery, using readily available parameters and on online calculator. This model could help to improve the selection of patients with the best risk-benefit profiles for hepatectomy.
Cytokine-induced killer cells are a mixture of immune cells given to eliminate cancer cells. However, not all patients respond to this treatment. Herein, we show in 2 different liver cancer models that myeloid-derived suppressor cells are increased in response to cytokine-induced killer cell therapy. Targeting these myeloid-derived suppressor cells may provide an additional therapeutic benefit alongside cytokine-induced killer cell therapy.
The prevalence of advanced liver disease in primary care managed hepatitis C is unknown. Our data suggests that rates of advanced fibrosis in the community are significant (16.5%), often underdiagnosed and comparable to rates seen in specialist referral centres. Liver stiffness measurement is a feasible community screening tool prior to hepatitis C therapy and can predict liver-related adverse events.
There is mounting evidence that FBXW7 functions as a tumor suppressor in many cancer types, including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, through its ability to promote the degradation of numerous oncoproteins. Herein, we have shown that the low expression of FBXW7 is ubiquitous in human cholangiocarcinoma specimens. This low expression is correlated with increased c-MYC activity, leading to tumorigenesis. Our findings suggest that targeting c-MYC might be an effective treatment for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
The role of adult hepatocytes at ectopic locations has not been clarified. In this study, we demonstrated that engrafted hepatocytes in the kidney proliferated, recruited non-parenchymal cells from host tissues including bone marrow, and finally created an organ-sized, complex liver system that exhibited liver-specific architectures and functions. Our results revealed previously undescribed functions of hepatocytes to direct liver organogenesis through non-parenchymal cell recruitment and organize multiple cell types into a complex 3D liver at ectopic sites.
In this study, we identified a subgroup of patients with lymphoma and resolved hepatitis B virus infection that had a high risk of hepatitis B virus reactivation after receiving rituximab-containing chemotherapy. These findings will help optimize a preventive strategy, especially in hepatitis B virus endemic regions with limited healthcare resources.
Conserved viral epitopes can be made considerably more accessible for binding of potently neutralizing antibodies by deletion of hypervariable region 1 and selected glycosylation sites. Recombinant E2 proteins carrying these mutations are unable to elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies suggesting that exposure of conserved epitopes is not sufficient to focus antibody responses on production of cross-neutralizing antibodies.
Biliary atresia is a severe inflammatory and obstructive disease of bile ducts occurring in infancy. Although the cause is unknown, activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems injures the bile duct epithelium. In this study we found that patients’ livers had increased expression of inflammasome genes. Using mice engineered to inactivate individual inflammasome genes, the epithelial injury and bile duct obstruction were prevented by the loss of Il1r1 or Nlrp3, with a decreased activation of natural killer cells and expression of cytokines and chemokines. In contrast, the loss of Casp1 did not change the disease phenotype. Combined, the findings point to a differential role of inflammasome gene products in the pathogenic mechanisms of biliary atresia.
High-risk radiological findings on preoperative hepatobiliary magnetic resonance imaging (either one of the following features: satellite nodule and peritumoural hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase) were associated with a higher tumour recurrence rate in patients transplanted either within or outside the Milan criteria.
Immunogenomic features of multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are important for understanding immune-escape mechanisms and developing more effective immunotherapy. Herein, comprehensive immunogenomic characterization showed that diverse genomic structures within multifocal HCC would leave footprints on the immune landscape. Only a few tumors were under the control of immunosurveillance, while others evaded the immune system through multiple mechanisms that led to poor prognosis. Our study revealed heterogeneous immunogenomic landscapes and immune-constrained tumor evolution, the understanding of which could be used to optimize personalized immunotherapies for multifocal HCC.
Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency (LAL-D) is a rare genetic condition that can cause severe liver disease, but it is difficult to diagnose and sometimes can look like simple fatty liver. It was not clear how common LAL-D was and whether many cases were being missed. To study this, we searched for all genetic mutations that could cause LAL-D, calculated how common those mutations were, and added them up. This let us estimate that LAL-D affects roughly 1 in 175,000 people. We conclude that LAL-D is a very rare condition, but it is treatable so may be included in a ‘second-line’ of tests for causes of fatty liver.
Antiviral therapy prevents disease progression and death in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), but the identification of patients in need of treatment is a challenge in low- and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested treatment eligibility criteria for use in such settings, but in our study the WHO criteria detected less than half of those in need of therapy in a large Ethiopian cohort of 1,190 patients with CHB. Our findings suggest that the WHO criteria might be unsuitable in sub-Saharan Africa.
The 2014 version of Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System criteria does not outperform the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases criteria for the non-invasive diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) smaller than 3 cm. Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System offers a nodule-based evaluation of the risk of HCC, allowing possible changes in management in these patients. The added value of ancillary features appears limited for the non-invasive diagnosis of small HCC.
The main result of this study is that spleen stiffness measurement, evaluated by transient elastography, seems to be the only predictor of the late recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma, defined as recurrence after 24 months from liver resection. Indeed, spleen stiffness measurement is directly correlated with the degree of liver disease and portal hypertension, which are both involved in carcinogenesis.
In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-related compensated cirrhosis, the expanded Baveno VI criteria work better than the Baveno VI criteria for ruling out the presence of varices needing treatment, sparing unnecessary and invasive screening procedures. New diagnostic criteria for this patient group, based on liver stiffness measurement and platelet count, and optimized for the specific FibroScan® probe used, work better than both Baveno VI and expanded Baveno VI criteria. The accuracy of all non-invasive scoring criteria was lower in non-obese patients.
Liver transplantation (LT) offers the best chance of survival for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and can be performed using grafts from deceased donors or live donors. In this work, we aimed to assess the differences in survival after live donor LT when compared to deceased donor LT. We studied 219 patients listed for live donor LT and 632 patients listed for deceased donor LT. Patients who had a potential live donor at the time of listing had a higher survival rate. Therefore, being listed for a live donor LT was a protective factor against death.
The presence of hepatocellular adenoma in pregnant women requires special consideration, as it carries the risk of growth and haemorrhage. In this study we followed 48 patients with hepatocellular adenoma <5 cm during 51 pregnancies and found that a hepatocellular adenoma during pregnancy confers minimal risk to the pregnant woman and none to her child.
This study analyses population-wide data from the healthcare systems in Taiwan and Hong Kong to develop and validate a risk score that predicts hepatocellular carcinoma during oral antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B. The easily calculable CAMD score requires only simple information (i.e. cirrhosis, age, male sex, and diabetes mellitus) at the baseline of treatment initiation. With a scoring range from 0 to 19 points, the CAMD score discriminates the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma with a concordance rate of around 75�80% during the first three years on therapy. The risk prediction can be extrapolated to five years on treatment with similar accuracy. Patients with a score <8 and >13_points were exposed to distinctly lower and higher risks, respectively.
The examination of liver tissue under the microscope (histology) serves to define the type and severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease morphologically, and is also used to determine improvement in therapeutic or natural history clinical trials. The FLIP algorithm/SAF classification is a new histological classification well validated on morphological but not clinical grounds. Here, we demonstrate that different disease categories defined by the FLIP/SAF classification correspond to entities of different clinical and biological severity. We also show a strong association between the activity of steatohepatitis (defined histologically) and the amount of fibrotic scar.
In this international multicenter study of 3,902 patients with primary biliary cholangitis, we found that treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid is associated with prolonged liver transplant-free survival. This association was significant, irrespective of sex, age, or disease stage. The survival benefit remained statistically significant in patients with an incomplete biochemical response to ursodeoxycholic acid therapy.
We investigated 21,182 patients with chronic hepatitis B receiving antiviral treatment. Alanine aminotransferase is a laboratory marker of liver function, with raised levels indicating liver dysfunction and in severe cases hepatitis. Normal on-treatment alanine aminotransferase during the first year of treatment in patients with CHB is associated with a lower risk of hepatic events.
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is a chronic liver disease that is associated with an increased risk of developing cirrhosis and cardiovascular disease. Recently, obeticholic acid (OCA), a farnesoid X receptor agonist, improved liver disease but led to an increase in cholesterol. However, the impact of OCA on cholesterol is not well understood. In the present study, we show that OCA therapy is associated with a detrimental increase in lipoprotein levels, which improves after drug discontinuation.
A longer duration of breastfeeding has been associated with multiple potential health benefits for the mother including reduction in heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers. In this study we found that breastfeeding for longer than 6 months was associated with a lower risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in mid-life.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy worldwide and remains a major clinical challenge. Our study reveals that ketoconazole, a broad-spectrum antifungal agent, activates PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy by downregulating COX-2, consequently resulting in the acceleration of apoptosis and thereby inhibiting the growth of HCC. Furthermore, ketoconazole acts synergistically with sorafenib in the suppression of HCC growth in vitro and in vivo.
Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (so called ALPPS), is a new two-staged approach to hepatectomy, which induces an unprecedented acceleration of liver regeneration, enabling treatment of patients with liver tumors that would otherwise be considered unresectable. Herein, we demonstrate that JNK1-IHH signaling from stellate cells is a key mechanism underlying the regenerative acceleration that is induced by ALPPS.
Kupffer cells (KCs) are the tissue-resident macrophages of the liver. KCs can be originated from fetal precursors and from monocytes during the fetal stage and post-birth, respectively. Most immune cells in mice are sensitive to lethal-irradiation-induced death, while a subset of KCs resists radiation-induced death. These radioresistant KCs continue to live in the irradiated mice. We discovered that this relatively radioresistant KC subset are the fetal-derived KCs, and they achieve this through cell-cycle arrest. Understanding the radiobiology of KCs will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms that elicit radiation-induced liver disease.
Data from 2,523 patients who underwent resection for hepatocellular carcinoma were used to estimate the probability that resection would enable treated patients to achieve the same life expectancy as patients with chronic hepatitis and/or cirrhosis, and the general population. Herein, the cure model suggests that in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, resection can enable patients to achieve the same life expectancy as those with chronic liver disease in 26.3% of cases and as the general population in 17.1% of cases.
In the clinical arm, graft YAP expression negatively correlated with liver function and tissue damage after human liver transplantation. YAP activation attenuated hepatocellular oxidative stress and diminished the innate immune response in mouse livers following ischemia-reperfusion injury. In the mouse model, YAP inhibited hepatic stellate cell activation, and abolished injury-mediated fibrogenesis up to 7 days after the ischemic insult.
Binge alcohol exposure causes gut leakiness, contributing to increased endotoxemia and inflammatory liver injury. Our results demonstrated for the first time the critical roles of apoptosis of enterocytes and nitration followed by ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic degradation of the junctional complex proteins in promoting this gut leakiness and endotoxemia. These results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of alcohol-induced inflammatory liver disease.
Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma in patients with cirrhosis only slightly improves coagulation test values in a limited number of patients and even appears to worsen them in a third of cases. Transfusion for the purpose of preventing or treating bleeding events could cause inherent risks and costs without clear benefits.
The incidence of fatty liver disease is reaching epidemic levels in the USA, with more than 30% of adults having NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), which can progress to more severe non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Herein, we show that disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier and gut vascular barrier are early events in the development of NASH. We show that the drug obeticholic acid protects against barrier disruption and thereby prevents the development of NASH, providing further evidence for its use in the prevention or treatment of NASH.
Understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive alcoholic hepatitis is important for the development of new biomarkers and targeted therapies. Herein, we describe a molecule that is increased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Modulating the molecular pathway of this molecule might lead to promising targets for the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis.
A carefully characterized model has been developed in mice that recapitulates the progressive stages of human fatty liver disease, from simple steatosis, to inflammation, fibrosis and cancer. The functional pathways of gene expression and immune abnormalities in this model closely resemble human disease. The ease and reproducibility of this model make it ideal to study disease pathogenesis and test new treatments.
CD4 T cells are important in controlling viral infections but are impaired in the context of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Therapeutic approaches to cure chronic HBV infection are highly likely to require an immune-stimulatory component. This study demonstrates that HBV-specific CD4 T cells can be functionally augmented by combined stimulation of the co-stimulatory molecule OX40 and blockade of the inhibitory PD-1 pathway.
Recently revised international guidelines for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) suggest that selected patients with inadequate surveillance on ultrasonography be assessed by alternative imaging modalities such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Herein, we show that MRI without contrast agents performed significantly better than ultrasonography for HCC surveillance in high-risk patients. Given this good performance, as well as short scan times and the lack of contrast agent-associated risks, non-enhanced MRI is a promising option for HCC surveillance in high-risk patients.
In our study we assessed whether the Amsterdam-Oxford model (AOM) is able to correctly estimate the risk of liver transplantation or death in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). This model uses 7 objective and readily available variables to estimate prognosis for individual patients at the time of PSC diagnosis. The AOM may aid in patient counselling and timing of diagnostic procedures or therapeutic interventions for complications of liver disease. We confirm that the model works well at PSC diagnosis, but also when the AOM is recalculated at different timepoints during follow-up, greatly improving the applicability of the model in clinical practice and for individual patients.
In Iceland, a nationwide program has been launched offering treatment for the entire population living with hepatitis C virus (HCV). A mathematical model was used to estimate the additional health system requirements to achieve the HCV elimination targets of the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as the year that this could occur. With some additional screening of people who inject drugs, Iceland could reach the WHO targets by 2020, becoming one of the first countries to achieve HCV elimination. The model estimated that once elimination targets were reached, maintaining current monitoring and harm reduction services while providing ongoing access to DAA therapy for people diagnosed with HCV would ensure that future HCV outbreaks are unlikely to occur.
We present for the first time, the clinical and laboratory effects of a first-in-class, engineered analogue of the endocrine hormone FGF19 in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). By incorporating non-invasive markers of fibrosis, beyond standard liver injury markers, we show that NGM282 impacted on fibrosis turnover and hepatic inflammation without changing alkaline phosphatase. Our findings demonstrate the complexities of using highly potent rational agents in PSC, and furthermore challenge the dogma about what the appropriate endpoints should be for trials in PSC.
The covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) form of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) sustains the persistence of the virus even decades after resolution of the symptomatic infection (occult HBV infection). In the present study we developed a highly sensitive method based on droplet digital PCR technology for the detection and quantitation of HBV cccDNA in the liver of individuals with occult HBV infection. We observed that the amount of HBV cccDNA may be inferred from the titer in serum of the IgG class antibody to the hepatitis B core antigen. The quantitation of this antibody may represent a surrogate to determine which patients are at the highest risk of HBV reactivation following immunosuppressive therapies.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis can lead to advanced liver disease. Both conditions are becoming increasingly prevalent as the epidemics of obesity and diabetes continue to increase. A mathematical model was built to understand how the disease burden associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis will change over time. Results suggest increasing cases of advanced liver disease and liver-related mortality in the coming years.
Little is known about the burden of hepatitis E among patients with haematological malignancy. We conducted a retrospective European cohort study among 50 patients with haematological malignancy, including haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, with clinically significant HEV infection and found that hepatitis E is associated with hepatic and extrahepatic mortality, including among patients with indolent disease or among stem cell transplant recipients in complete remission. Hepatitis E virus infection evolved to chronic hepatitis in 5 (45.5%) patients exposed to a rituximab-containing regimen and 10 (47.6%) stem cell transplant recipients. Reducing immunosuppressive therapy because of hepatitis E was associated with mortality, while early ribavirin treatment was safe and effective.
Primary liver cancer is a malignant disease with poor prognosis, largely because there are limited systemic therapies available. We show here that a cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 is required for liver tumorigenesis. This tumorigenesis is driven by two oncoproteins that are implicated in human liver cancer. This, together with our previous studies, uncovers the complexity of liver tumorigenesis, by elucidating the pro- and anti-tumor effects of Shp2 in mouse models. This data can be used to guide new therapies.
Treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX) for 12 weeks is the current recommendation for the 5% of patients infected with HCV who do not achieve eradication of the virus under treatment with direct-acting antivirals. In a Spanish cohort of 137 patients who failed a previous combination of direct-acting antivirals, a cure rate of 95% was achieved with SOF/VEL/VOX. Genotypic characteristics of the virus (genotype 3) and the presence of cirrhosis were factors that decreased the rate of cure. Treatment with SOF/VEL/VOX is an effective and safe rescue therapy due to its high efficacy and very good safety profile.
Until the year 2015, consistent replication of patient-derived isolates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in an in vitro model remained a limitation in HCV research. In 2015 a group of authors identified a protein named SEC14L2 that enabled the replication of HCV isolates in cell culture. We performed a large screen encompassing 73 isolates of 4 different HCV genotypes. Additionally, we replaced the natural SEC14L2 with 13 different mutants to test if the protein variation significantly altered its HCV replication enhancing functions. We showed that different genotypes of HCV react differently to the presence of this protein and the variants of the protein mimic the behavior of the wild-type.
We are presenting the largest national program for HCV treatment in the world. We clearly demonstrate that hepatitis C can be cured efficiently in large scale real-life programs. This is a clear statement that global HCV eradication is foreseeable, providing a model for other countries with limited resources and prevalent HCV. Moreover, the availability of generic products has influenced the success of this program.
During chronic injury, the liver often repairs with fibrotic tissue, which impairs liver function, and for which there is currently no treatment. We found that a previously unexplored pathway involving the purinergic receptor P2X4, can modulate fibrotic liver repair. Therefore, this receptor could be of interest in the development of novel therapies for fibrotic liver diseases.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common multifactorial disorder with a strong genetic component. Inherited forms of NAFLD have been suspected but, their molecular pathogenesis has not been disclosed. Here we report a heritable form of NAFLD with clinical expression after 40 years of age, associated with monoallelic ABHD5 mutations.
A schistosome-specific microRNA, sja-miR-2162, is consistently present in the hepatic stellate cells of mice infected with S. japonicum, where it promotes hepatic fibrosis in the host through cross-species regulation of host fibrosis-related genes. The efficient and sustained inhibition of pathogen-derived micRNAs may represent a novel therapeutic intervention for infectious diseases.
We compared the hepatic arterial infusion of FOLFOX (a combination chemotherapy) with sorafenib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, retrospectively. It was found that hepatic arterial infusion of FOLFOX therapy may improve both progression free and overall survival in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
Acute liver injury which can cause lethal liver failure is medicated by a class of proteins called cytokines. Among these, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and the corresponding receptor IL-1R1 play a prominent role in the immune system, but their role in the liver is undetermined. In the current study, a novel mouse model with defective IL-1R1 in liver cells was studied. Mice lacking this receptor in liver cells were protected from cell death to a certain extent. This protection occurred only in the presence of other, neighboring cells, arguing for the involvement of proteins derived from these cells. This effect is called paracrine signaling and the current study has for the first time shown that the IL-1R1 receptor on hepatocytes is involved in acute liver failure in this context. The approved drug anakinra – which blocks IL-1R1 – had the same effect, supporting the proposed mechanism of action. The findings of this study suggest new treatment options for patients with acute liver failure by blocking defined signals of the immune system.
In contrast to hepatitis B virus, infection with hepatitis D virus induces a strong IFN-β/λ response in innate immune competent cell lines. MDA5 is the key sensor for the recognition of hepatitis D virus replicative intermediates. An IFN-activated state did not prevent hepatitis D virus replication in vitro, indicating that hepatitis D virus is resistant to self-induced innate immune responses and therapeutic IFN treatment.
Ex vivo liver resection and autotransplantation were performed in a large series of patients with end-stage hepatic alveolar echinococcosis. The results showed that this surgical option was feasible, with acceptable postoperative mortality, but 100% disease-free survival in survivors. Careful patient selection, as well as precise assessment for size and quality of the remnant liver are key to successful surgery.
The adult liver has an extraordinary ability to regenerate after injury despite the accumulation of scar-forming factors that normally block the proliferation and reduce the survival of residual liver cells. We discovered that liver cells manage to escape these growth-inhibitory influences by transiently becoming more like fibroblasts themselves. They do this by reactivating programs that are known to drive tissue growth during fetal development and in many cancers. Understanding how the liver can control programs that are involved in scarring and cancer may help in the development of new treatments for cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Heterogeneity in the regional immune microenvironments of tumors has been reported in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. This heterogeneity could be an obstacle when trying to reliably evaluate the immune microenvironment of an entire tumor using only a single-region tumor sample, which may be the only option in patients with more advanced disease. Our study utilized both immunohistochemical and transcriptomic analyses to demonstrate that a single-region sample is reliable for evaluation of tumor immune microenvironments in 60–70% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
For intestinal bacteria to enter the systemic circulation, they must cross the mucus and epithelial layer, as well as the gut-vascular barrier. Cirrhosis disrupts all 3 of these barriers, giving bacteria access to the portal-venous circulation and thus, the gut-liver axis. Diminished luminal bile acid availability, cirrhosis and the associated reduction in farnesoid x receptor (FXR) signaling seem, at least partly, to mediate these changes, as FXR-agonists reduce bacterial translocation via the portal-venous route to the liver in cirrhosis.
Accumulation of abnormal proteins in the livers of patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency may lead to decreased liver function and potentially liver failure. Therapeutics targeting the production of these abnormal proteins may be used to prevent or treat liver disease in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
The pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH) is likely due to the interaction between a deranged metabolic milieu and local mediators of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in the insulin resistant state. This study provides in vivo support for a possible link between deranged metabolism in the adipose tissue and activation of hepatic macrophages in patients with NAFLD, most likely in response to free fatty acid overflow and independent of obesity and diabetes.
The defense functions of immune cells are suppressed in cholangiocarcinoma tumors. Stimulating or blocking “immune checkpoint” molecules expressed on tumor-infiltrating T cells can enhance the defense functions of these cells. Therefore, these molecules may be promising targets for therapeutic stimulation of immune cells to eradicate the tumors and prevent cancer recurrence in patients with cholangiocarcinoma.
We estimated the rates of chronic comorbidities other than liver disease between those who were cured and those who failed treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Our findings showed that the rates of these non-liver diseases were largely reduced for those who were cured with interferon-based treatments. Early HCV treatments could provide many benefits in the prevention of various HCV complications beyond liver disease.
Newborns face major challenges in the extra-uterine life. In fact, organs need to modify their cellular composition and gene expression profile in order to adapt to changes in both microbiota and diet throughout life. The liver is interposed between the gastrointestinal system and the systemic circulation, being the destination of all macronutrients and microbial products from the gut. Therefore, it is expected that delicately balanced mechanisms govern the transformation of a neonatal liver to a key organ in adults.
It is currently unclear which antiviral agent, entecavir or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, is superior for improving prognosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. In this analysis we found that there was no difference in terms of overall prognosis, including risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, death, or the need for a liver transplant, in patients receiving either antiviral.
Clathrin heavy-chain expression increases during liver tumorigenesis in humans (CLTC) and mice (Cltc), altering the cellular response to TGF-β in favour of anti-apoptotic/pro-tumorigenic signals. A positive correlation between TGFB1 and CLTC was found in HCC cells and patients. Patients expressing high levels of TGFB1 and CLTC had a worse prognosis and lower overall survival. CLTC expression in HCC human samples could help select patients that would benefit from therapies targeting TGF-β.
CAP is a new ultrasound-based technique for measuring fat content in the liver, but has never been tested for fatty liver caused by alcohol. Herein, we examined 562 patients in a multicentre setting. We show that CAP highly correlates with liver fat, and patients with a CAP value above 290 dB/m were highly likely to have more than 5% fat in their livers, determined by liver biopsy. CAP was also better than regular ultrasound for determining the severity of alcoholic fatty-liver disease. Finally, we show that three in four (non-obese) patients rapidly decrease in CAP after short-term alcohol withdrawal. In contrast, obese alcohol-overusing patients were more likely to have higher CAP values than lean patients, irrespective of drinking.
In patients with liver failure, disturbances in brain function are caused in part by ammonium toxicity. In our project we studied how ammonia, through adenosine release, affects the blood flow in the brain of rats. In our experimental model we demonstrated that the detrimental effect of ammonia on blood flow regulation was counteracted by blocking the adenosine receptors in the brain. With this observation we identified a novel potential treatment target. If we can confirm our findings in a future clinical study, this might help patients with liver failure and the severe condition called hepatic encephalopathy.
In a large real-world cohort of patients mainly treated by physicians in private practice in Germany, shorter HCV treatment (8-week) resulted in equivalent cure rates to 12-week treatment in genotype 1 HCV-infected patients. Thus, shorter treatment can be recommended in these patients which would substantially reduce costs of therapy.
There are two main stages in cirrhosis, compensated and decompensated, each with a main relevant outcome. In compensated cirrhosis the main relevant outcome is the development of ascites, while in decompensated cirrhosis it is death. Major roles of cardiac dysfunction and systemic inflammation have been hypothesized in the evolution of the disease in decompensated patients. In this study, we have shown that these factors were also involved in the progression from compensated to decompensated stage.
Yttrium-90 transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is a microembolic procedure that minimizes alterations to hepatic arterial flow, and thus can be safely performed in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the independent predictors of long-term outcomes in patients with HCC and PVTT treated with TARE. Bilirubin level, extension of PVTT and tumor burden were independently related to post-treatment survival: the combination of these factors allowed us to build a prognostic stratification that may help to better identify good candidates for the treatment, and those for whom TARE may be futile.
Plectin is a cytolinker protein capable of interconnecting all three cytoskeletal filament systems and linking them to plasma membrane-bound junctional complexes. In liver, the plectin-controlled cytoskeleton mechanically stabilizes epithelial cells and provides them with the capacity to adapt to increased bile pressure under cholestasis.
In this integrated analysis of nine clinical trials, patients with chronic HCV genotype 1�6 infection without cirrhosis were treated for either 8 or 12_weeks with the direct-acting antiviral regimen glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P). The cure rate was 98% and 99% following 8 and 12_weeks of treatment, respectively; the difference in rates was not significant (p_=_0.2), nor was there a significant difference in the cure rates across the two treatment durations on the basis of baseline patient or viral characteristics. These results, along with a favourable safety profile, indicate that G/P is a highly efficacious and well-tolerated pangenotypic eight-week therapy for most patients with chronic HCV infection.
Candidalysin is a peptide toxin secreted by the commensal gut fungus Candida albicans. Candidalysin enhances alcohol-associated liver disease independently of the β-glucan receptor CLEC7A on bone marrow-derived cells in mice without affecting intestinal permeability. Candidalysin is cytotoxic to primary hepatocytes, indicating a direct role of candidalysin on ethanol-induced liver disease. Candidalysin might be an effective target for therapy in patients with alcohol-associated liver disease.
There is a lack of data regarding treatment of immune-tolerant chronic hepatitis B (CHB). It remains unresolved how children with immune-tolerant CHB should be treated. This paper reports the outcomes from a pilot open-label randomized controlled trial on antiviral therapy in children with immune-tolerant characteristics. It shows that a sequential combination of interferon-α and lamivudine was beneficial.
Hepatitis C virus eradication by direct-acting antiviral agents improves carotid atherosclerosis in patients with advanced fibrosis/compensated cirrhosis. The improvement in intima-media thickness and carotid thickening was confirmed after stratification for severity of liver disease and cardiovascular risk factors. Hepatitis C virus eradication by direct-acting antiviral agents also lead to improvement in glucose homeostasis and increased cholesterol levels.
This report describes progress in Georgia's hepatitis C elimination program and highlights efforts to promote hepatitis C virus screening and treatment initiation on a national scale. Georgia has made progress towards eliminating hepatitis C, treating over 50,000 people, approximately one-third of the number infected, and achieving cure for 98.5% of those tested. However, identifying infected individuals and linking them to care remains challenging. Novel approaches to increase diagnostic testing can have unintended consequences further down the care cascade.
Alcohol consumption alters gut microbiota and multiple intestinal barrier protecting factors that are regulated by intestinal hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). Absence of intestinal HIF-1α exacerbates gut leakiness leading to an increased translocation of bacteria and bacterial products to the liver, consequently causing alcoholic liver disease. Intestinal specific upregulation of HIF-1α could be developed as a novel approach for the treatment of alcoholic liver disease.
A large community-based educate, test and treat hepatitis C programme was conducted in more than 200,000 villagers across 73 villages in Egypt. This study demonstrates that a simplified care model can achieve high uptake of testing, linkage to care and treatment, with high cure rates. We consider this a model for the elimination of hepatitis C virus infection in rural communities, which can be applied to other countries highly affected by hepatitis C.
Some patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are non-obese. The optimal management of such patients is unclear. In this long-term follow-up study of a clinical trial, we show that remission of NAFLD can be achieved in 67% of non-obese patients after lifestyle intervention. The majority of patients can achieve NAFLD remission with modest weight loss of 3–10%. Non-obese patients are also more likely than obese patients to maintain weight reduction and normal liver enzymes in the long run.
This is the largest European real-life study evaluating effectiveness and safety of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX) in a large cohort of consecutive patients with hepatitis C virus infection and a prior direct-acting antiviral failure, who were treated within the NAVIGATORE Lombardia and Veneto Networks, in Italy. This study demonstrated excellent effectiveness (98% and 96% sustained virological response rates at week 4 and 12, respectively) and an optimal safety profile of SOF/VEL/VOX. Cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma onset were the only features associated with treatment failure.
Virus-induced fulminant hepatitis (FH) is a disease with a high mortality worldwide. Enhanced levels of macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (Msr1) in the liver of patients with FH and of murine experimental FH indicated Msr1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of FH. Herein, we demonstrate that mice deficient in Msr1 are resistant to FH induced by MHV-A59, and the Msr1 inhibitor fucoidan suppresses the progression of FH in mice. Our study suggests that use of drugs inhibiting MSR1 function could be beneficial to patients with FH.
In patients with fatty liver disease, the enzymes that convert nitrogen waste into urea may be affected, leading to the accumulation of ammonia, which is toxic. This accumulation of ammonia can lead to scar tissue development, increasing the risk of disease progression. In this study, we show that fat accumulation in the liver produces a reversible reduction in the function of the enzymes that are involved in detoxification of ammonia. These data provide potential new targets for the treatment of fatty liver disease.
Machine perfusion techniques are currently being introduced into the clinic, with the aim of optimising injured grafts prior to implantation. While short-term effects of machine liver perfusion have been frequently reported in terms of hepatocellular enzyme release and early graft function, the long-term benefit on irreversible graft loss has been unclear. Herein, we report on 5-year graft survival in donation after cardiac death livers, treated either by conventional cold storage, or by 1–2 h of hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) after cold storage. Graft loss was significantly less in HOPE-treated livers, despite longer donor warm ischaemia times. Therefore, HOPE after cold storage appears to be a simple and effective method to treat high-risk livers before implantation.
Liver cancer has a poor prognosis. Defining the molecular pathways involved is important for developing new therapeutic approaches. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is the most frequently deregulated pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mutations of AXIN1, a member of this pathway, represent about 10% of HCC mutations. Using both human HCC collections and engineered mouse models of liver cancers with AXIN1 mutation or deletion, we defined a common signature of liver tumors mutated for AXIN1 and demonstrate that these tumors occur independently of the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
Autophagy is a physiological process controlling endothelial homeostasis in vascular beds outside the liver. This study demonstrates that autophagy is defective in the liver endothelial cells of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. This defect promotes liver inflammation and fibrosis at early stages of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but also at advanced stages of chronic liver disease.
In clinical practice, cure rates for hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2 were 94% and cure rates for HCV genotype 3 were 90%. The chance of achieving cure was the same whether a person received daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir or velpatasvir/sofosbuvir. Ribavirin did not affect cure rates. The chance of a cure was lowest in people who had received HCV medication in the past
Infections caused by bacteria resistant to the main antibiotic families are prevalent in patients with cirrhosis. This study demonstrates that this healthcare problem is increasing and extends through all European regions. Infections caused by these difficult to treat bacteria resolve less frequently and often cause the death of the patient. The type of resistant bacteria varies markedly among different hospitals.
Liver transplantation (LT) for patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure grade 3 (ACLF-3) significantly improves survival, but 1-year survival probability after LT remains lower than the expected outcomes for transplant centers. Our study reveals that among patients transplanted within 28 days of waitlist registration, improvement of ACLF-3 at listing to a lower grade of ACLF at transplantation significantly enhances post-transplant survival, even among patients aged 60 years or older. Subgroup analysis further demonstrates that improvement in circulatory failure, brain failure, or removal from mechanical ventilation have the strongest impact on post-transplant survival.
Patients who received direct-acting antiviral medications for hepatitis C at several liver centers in the US did not generally experience significant changes in baseline symptoms during treatment. We observed a full range of patient experiences with some patients experiencing substantial symptom improvements, yet others experiencing less improvements and some even experiencing a worsening of symptoms. The 1,346 patients who were cured of hepatitis C experienced improvements in fatigue, sleep disturbance, and functional well-being, and trends for improved pain and depression; whereas the 64 who were not cured experienced minimal improvements.
The hepatic venous pressure gradient is associated with outcomes in patients with cirrhosis undergoing elective extrahepatic surgery. It enables a better stratification of risk in these patients and provides the foundations for potential interventions to improve post-surgical outcomes.
Direct-acting antiviral therapy results in cure of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in almost all treated patients. However, the impacts of HCV cure on immune responses remain controversial. Whether immune responses to HCV recover is important in cases of re-exposure, or for the resolution of extrahepatic manifestations. The main finding of our study was that HCV-specific T cells remain functionally impaired despite HCV clearance. This finding could explain the fact that HCV cure does not lead to protective immunity and that re-infections have frequently been observed.
This study was the first to evaluate an 8-week direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen active against all major types of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in untreated patients with compensated cirrhosis. High virological cure rates were achieved with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir across HCV genotypes 1–6, and these high cure rates did not depend on any patient or viral characteristics present before treatment. This may simplify care and allow non-specialist healthcare professionals to treat these patients, contributing to global efforts to eliminate HCV.
Diabetes occurring in cirrhosis as a direct consequence of loss of liver function should regress after transplantation of a new functioning liver, though the pathophysiological mechanisms are unclear. This is the first study evaluating the contribution of all 3 direct determinants of insulin-dependent glucose regulation using a sophisticated mathematical model. Results show that β-cell function is the key process governing favourable or detrimental changes in glucose regulation in cirrhotic patients undergoing transplantation, pointing to the need to develop therapies to sustain β-cell function in these individuals.
This analysis examined characteristics and outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who were treated with regorafenib after they had disease progression during sorafenib treatment. Regorafenib provided clinical benefit to patients regardless of the pace of their disease progression during prior sorafenib treatment and regardless of their last sorafenib dose. The sequence of sorafenib followed by regorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma may extend survival beyond what has been previously reported.
Spleen stiffness measurement assessed by transient elastography, the most widely used elastography technique, is a non-invasive technique that can help the physician to better stratify the degree of portal hypertension and the risk of esophageal varices in patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease. Performing spleen stiffness measurement together with liver stiffness measurement during the same examination is simple and fast and this sequential model can identify a greater number of patients that can safely avoid endoscopy, which is an invasive and expensive examination.
We report that hepatitis C virus infections are frequently acquired among HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM) using pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV infection. New infections occurred more frequently in those reporting receptive anal sex without using condoms, having an anal sexually transmitted infection, injecting drugs, and sharing straws when snorting drugs. The viruses found in HIV-negative men using pre-exposure prophylaxis are genetically similar to those in HIV-positive men, but not in other hepatitis C risk groups, suggesting that (sexual) transmission is occurring between HIV-positive MSM and HIV-negative MSM using pre-exposure prophylaxis.
Using a unique hepatocellular model system designed to support viral growth, we demonstrate that hepatitis B virus (HBV) has remarkably slow infection kinetics. Establishment of the episomal transcription template and the persistent form of the virus, so called covalently closed circular DNA, as well as viral transcription and protein expression all take a long time. Once established, HBV maintains a stable pool of covalently closed circular DNA via intracellular recycling of HBV genomes and through infection of naïve cells by newly formed virions.
Even with the recently approved immunotherapies against liver cancer, currently available medications show limited clinical benefits or efficacy in the majority of patients. As such, it remains a top priority to discover new targets for effective liver cancer treatment. Here, we identify a critical role for the proline biosynthetic pathway in liver cancer development, and demonstrate that targeting key proteins in the pathway, namely PYCR1 and ALDH18A1, may be a novel therapeutic strategy for liver cancer.
This is a propensity-matched nationwide observational cohort study performed using livers recovered from donors undergoing cardiac arrest provoked by the intentional withdrawal of life support (controlled donation after circulatory death, cDCD). Approximately half of the livers were recovered after a period of postmortem in situ normothermic regional perfusion, which restored warm oxygenated blood to the abdominal organs, whereas the remainder were recovered after rapid preservation with a cold solution. The study results suggest that the use of postmortem normothermic regional perfusion helps reduce rates of post-transplant biliary complications and graft loss and allows for the successful transplantation of livers from older cDCD donors.
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) represents a large and growing public health concern with no approved therapy. NGM282, an engineered analogue of the gut hormone FGF19, reduces liver fat, liver injury and inflammation in patients with NASH. However, NGM282 increases cholesterol levels. Here we show that co-administration of a statin can manage the cholesterol increase seen in patients with NASH receiving treatment with NGM282, producing a favorable overall lipid profile.
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases are important inflammatory factors. In the present study, we demonstrated that p38α is upregulated in liver tissues of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases. Genetic deletion of p38α in macrophages led to ameliorated nutritional steatohepatitis in mice through decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and increased M2 macrophage polarization.
Primary biliary cholangitis is a liver disease in which most patients have antibodies to mitochondrial proteins containing lipoic acid binding site(s). This paper identified a man-made chemical present in soils around a waste site. It was then shown that this chemical was metabolized into a product with structural similarity to lipoic acid, which was capable of replacing lipoic acid in mitochondrial proteins.
The protein CARD6 plays an important role during the process of liver blood flow restriction (ischemia) and restoration (reperfusion). By suppressing the activity of ASK1, CARD6 can protect against hepatocyte injury. Targeting CARD6 is a potential strategy for prevention and treatment of ischemia/reperfusion injury.
A large proportion of adult liver transplant recipients who survive for a long time exhibit subclinical histological abnormalities. The expression profile (a measurement of the activity of genes) of liver tissue from a large fraction of these patients closely resembles the profile of T cell mediated rejection. Liver allografts showing the highest expression levels of rejection-related genes developed progressive damage over time.
There are still controversies concerning the impact of non-selective beta blockers on outcomes in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, especially in those with refractory ascites. In this study of 584 cirrhotic patients evaluated for liver transplantation, who underwent right heart catheterization, we have shown that global cardiac performance measured by left ventricular stroke work index is lower in patients with refractory ascites. Administration of non-selective beta blockers in patients with compromised cardiac performance may increase waiting list mortality. These results highlight the prognostic value of global cardiac performance in patients with end-stage cirrhosis.
Hepatitis B virus causes a chronic infection which develops into severe liver disease and liver cancer. The viral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is responsible for the persistence of the infection in hepatocytes. To better manage patient treatment and follow-up, and to develop new antiviral treatments directly targeting the intrahepatic pool of cccDNA, serum surrogate markers reflecting the viral activity in the liver are urgently needed. In this work, we demonstrate that quantification of hepatitis B core-related antigen in serum correlates with cccDNA amount and activity and could be used to monitor disease progression.
Although effective treatments against hepatitis C virus (HCV) are available, 500,000 people die from liver disease caused by HCV each year and approximately 1.75 million people are newly infected. This could be prevented by a vaccine. To design a vaccine against HCV, more insight into the role of antibodies in the protection against HCV infection is needed. In a cohort of injecting drug users, we found that antibodies interfering with virus cell entry, and recognizing multiple HCV genotypes, conferred long-term protection against chronic HCV infection.
The evaluation of liver fibrosis is mandatory in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), as advanced fibrosis identifies the subgroup of patients with impaired prognosis. FibroMeterVCTE is a new fibrosis test combining blood markers and the result of vibration controlled transient elastography (VCTE) into a single diagnostic test. Our results show that FibroMeterVCTE outperforms other blood fibrosis tests and VCTE alone for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis in a large multi-centric cohort of 938 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Sequential algorithms using a simple blood test or VCTE as a first-line procedure, then FibroMeterVCTE as a second-line test accurately classified 90% of patients.
We applied next-generation sequencing and conducted an in-depth genomic analysis of hepatocellular carcinomas from a Chinese patient cohort. The results delineate the genomic events that characterize hepatocellular carcinomas in Chinese patients and identify WNK2 as a driver associated with early tumor recurrence after curative resection.
In asymptomatic individuals, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was an independent risk factor for non-calcified plaque, which has been known as a vulnerable plaque associated with sudden and unexpected cardiac events. Therefore, appropriate medical therapy for NAFLD was required to reduce future cardiac events.
Outcomes of patients treated for intermediate-sized hepatocellular carcinoma by surgical resection or no-touch multibipolar radiofrequency ablation were compared. No-touch multibipolar radiofrequency ablation was associated with a lower overall morbidity and a higher rate of systematized recurrence within the treated segment or in an adjacent segment within a 2 cm distance from the initial tumor site. Most patients with intrahepatic recurrence remained eligible for rescue curative therapy, enabling them to achieve similar long-term oncological results after both treatments.
Hepatitis B virus modulates liver macrophage function in order to favour the establishment and likely maintenance of infection. It impairs the production of the antiviral cytokine IL-1β, while promoting that of IL-10 in the microenvironment. This phenotype can be recapitulated in naive liver macrophages or monocyte-derived-macrophages ex vivo by short exposure to the virus or cells replicating the virus, thus suggesting an “easy to implement” mechanism of inhibition.
This study shows that the protein MX2, which is induced by interferon-α, has important anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) effector functions. MX2 can reduce the amount of covalently closed circular DNA, which is the form of DNA that HBV uses to maintain viral persistence within hepatocytes. MX2 also reduces HBV RNA levels by downregulating synthesis of viral RNA. MX2 likely represents a novel intrinsic HBV inhibitor that could have therapeutic potential, as well as being useful for improving our understanding of the complex biology of HBV and the antiviral mechanisms of interferon-α.
In this study, we found that mutations and changes in expression of epigenetic modifiers are common events in human hepatocellular carcinoma, leading to an aggressive gene expression program and poor clinical prognosis. The transcriptional program can be reversed by pharmacological inhibition of Jumonji enzymes. This inhibition blocks hepatocellular carcinoma progression, providing a novel potential therapeutic strategy.
Activation of the innate immune system contributes to inflammation in the progression of alcohol-related liver disease, as well as to the resolution of injury. Here we show that the protein IRF3 modulates the innate immune environment of the liver in a mouse model of alcoholic hepatitis. It does this by increasing the apoptotic cell death of immune cells that promote the resolution of injury.
For patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma requiring sorafenib therapy, co-administration with conventional transarterial chemoembolization did not improve overall survival compared to sorafenib alone. Therefore, sorafenib alone remains the first-line standard of care for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
Genetic hemochromatosis is an inherited disorder that leads to progressive iron overload in the body. It results in chronic fatigue and in potential liver (cirrhosis), pancreas (diabetes) and joint (arthritis) damage in adulthood. The present study showed that tobacco smoking may aggravate iron loading, but that hemochromatosis has become less and less severe over the last 30 years despite patients being older at diagnosis, likely because of the protective effects of lower alcohol consumption and of increased weight in the French population.
The World Health Organization’s goal to reduce hepatitis C virus incidence by 80% will be difficult to achieve without widespread scale up and a corresponding reduction in viraemic prevalence among those most at risk of onward transmission. Our results indicate that a population-level reduction in viraemic prevalence is achievable through high levels of treatment and cure among people who inject drugs.
Cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) is the main consequence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Cirrhosis leads to high pressure in the portal vein which accounts for most of the complications of cirrhosis. Reducing portal pressure is beneficial in patients with cirrhosis. We studied the possibility that emricasan, a drug that improves inflammation and scarring in the liver, would reduce portal pressure in patients with NASH-related cirrhosis and severe portal hypertension. Our results in a large, prospective, double-blind study could not demonstrate a beneficial effect of emricasan in these patients.
Knowledge of the natural history of a disease allows clinicians and patients to understand the risks that are associated with a medical condition. In this study we systematically gathered all the published data regarding the natural history of alcohol-related liver disease in people who had a liver biopsy. We used this data to define the prevalence of the disease, the annual risk of progression to cirrhosis and the annual risk of death at each stage of the disease.
Radiofrequency ablation and liver transplantation are treatment options for early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). After ablation some patients will experience recurrence or metastatic spread of the initial tumor or may develop new tumors within the liver. Despite close follow-up, these recurrences can progress rapidly and exceed transplant criteria, preventing the patient from receiving a transplant. We identified that patients with HCC >2 cm and higher serum alpha-fetoprotein are at greater risk of recurrence beyond the transplant criteria. These data suggest that liver transplantation should be considered immediately after the first HCC recurrence for these patients.
Overestimation of renal function frequently occurs in patients with liver cirrhosis when using serum creatinine. Decreased muscle mass has a great impact on overestimation of kidney function especially in male patients with cirrhosis. Compared with creatinine, cystatin C was more closely correlated with measured glomerular filtration rate and had a higher predictive ability for renal complications and survival than creatinine.
Individuals that are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) possess an increased number of immune cells, called natural killer (NK) cells expressing the surface marker KLRG1 in the blood and liver. Here, we demonstrate that these specific NK cells are able to kill activated stellate cells in the liver. Because activated stellate cells contribute to liver scarring, i.e. fibrosis, and subsequent liver dysfunction in individuals with chronic HBV infection, KLRG1+ NK cells are a novel immune cell type that can limit liver scarring.
Currently available laboratory systems are unable to reproduce the dynamics of hepatitis B virus (HBV) spread through the infected liver and release into the blood. We developed a slowly dividing liver-derived cell line which multiplies infectious viral particles upon inoculation with patient- or cell culture-derived HBV. This new infection model can improve therapy by measuring, in advance, the sensitivity of a patient’s HBV strain to specific antiviral drugs.
Liver adenomatosis is a rare disease characterized by the presence of 10 or more hepatocellular adenomas that may rarely be of genetic origin. Patients with liver adenomatosis have multiple adenomas of different subtypes, with a risk of bleeding and malignant transformation that justify a specific management and follow-up.
Hepatocyte transplantation is a promising alternative to liver transplantation for the treatment of liver diseases. However, it is inefficient, as restricted growth of transplanted cells in the liver limits its therapeutic benefits. Preparative treatments improve the efficiency of this procedure, but no clinically-feasible options are currently available. In this study we develop a novel well-tolerated preparative treatment to improve growth of cells in the liver and then demonstrate that this treatment completely cures an inherited lipid disorder in a mouse model.
Congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) is a genetic liver disease caused by mutations of the PKHD1 gene. Dysfunction of the protein it encodes, fibrocystin, is closely associated with CHF pathogenesis. Using an in vitro human induced pluripotent stem cell model and patient samples, we showed that the loss of fibrocystin function promotes proliferation of cholangiocytes and the production of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in an interleukin 8 (IL-8)-dependent manner. These results suggest that IL-8 and CTGF are essential for the pathogenesis of CHF.
Hepatitis C is an infectious disease that mainly infects the liver, but has also been shown to have negative effects on other organs. This nationwide study demonstrates an increased risk of hepatitis C patients developing reduced kidney function and the need for dialysis. The study also showed improved survival in dialysis patients who received antiviral treatment.
In patients with chronic liver disease, an acute deterioration of liver function combined with single or multiple organ failures is known as acute-on-chronic liver failure. This study shows that acute-on-chronic liver failure is frequent during the course of severe alcoholic hepatitis. In severe alcoholic hepatitis, acute-on-chronic liver failure is associated with high mortality and frequently occurs after an infection.
We classified a novel genotype of the full-length hepatitis B virus X gene (HBx), HBx-E2. This genotype was identified in tumor and nontumor tissues from patients with hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma. HBx-E2 could preoperatively predict the prognosis of patients with intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma, after resection.
HSP72 constitutes a stress-inducible, protective protein. Our data demonstrate that it is upregulated in patients with chronic hepatitis C and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Moreover, Hsp72-overexpressing mice are protected from various forms of liver stress.
Sorafenib is approved as the standard therapy for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, but only provides limited survival benefit. Herein, we found that inhibition of the kinase ERK2 increases the response to sorafenib in liver cancer. Our data indicate that a combination of sorafenib and a MEK inhibitor is most likely to be effective in tumors with high basal phospho-ERK levels.
The relevance of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis E virus infections has been discussed controversially. Herein, we present the first report on routine hepatitis E virus screening of blood donations at a tertiary care centre in Germany. Hepatitis E viraemia was found at a relatively high rate of 0.12% among blood donors, which represents a relevant transfusion-related risk for vulnerable patient populations.
There is a growing epidemic of advanced liver disease, this could be offset by early detection and management. Checking liver blood tests (LFTs) should be an opportunity to diagnose liver problems, but abnormal results are often incompletely investigated. In this study we were able to substantially increase the diagnostic yield of the abnormal LFTs using the automated intelligent LFT system. With the addition of referral recommendations and management plans, this strategy provides optimum investigation and management of LFTs and is cost saving to the NHS.
A positron emission tomography (PET scan), using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG), can help doctors identify areas of cancer in the body by highlighting “hot spots”. These hotspots may be cancerous (true positive) but may also be non-cancerous, like inflammation (false positive). We show that PET scans are useful to assess how far advanced the cancer is (by assessing spread to lymph glands and to other organs) and also to identify if the cancer has recurred (for example after surgery), thus helping doctors to make treatment decisions. However, a biopsy is still needed for the initial diagnosis of a biliary tract cancer, because of the high chance of a “false positive” with PET scans.
Caucasian patients with chronic hepatitis B with or without compensated cirrhosis who receive long-term entecavir or tenofovir therapy have excellent overall eight-year survival, which is similar to that of the general population. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the main factor affecting their overall mortality, and is the only factor affecting liver-related mortality in this setting.
Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection is the most severe form of viral hepatitis. We found that in patients with HDV, a subset of innate-like T cells called mucosa-associated invariant T cells (or MAIT cells), which are normally abundant in peripheral blood and the liver, are activated, functionally impaired and severely depleted.
Cholestasis is common after burn injuries and is associated with burn severity, sepsis, organ failure and mortality. Patients with hyperbilirubinemia without elevated alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase levels after the burn injury have a poor prognosis. Patients with burn-associated cholestasis may develop sclerosing cholangitis and secondary biliary cirrhosis.
Acute liver injury due to heatstroke can progress to acute liver failure with organ dysfunction despite medical treatment; in such situations, liver transplantation (LT) may offer a therapeutic option. The classic criteria for LT appear to be poorly adapted to heatstroke-related acute liver failure. We confirmed that medication is the first-line therapy acute liver injury caused by heatstroke, with LT only rarely necessary. A decision to perform LT should not be made hastily. Fluctuations in prothrombin time and the patient’s clinical status should be considered even in the event of severe liver failure.
We applied multiregional whole-exome sequencing to investigate the evolution of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). The results revealed that many factors, such as parallel evolution and chromosome instability, may participate and promote the branch diversity of ICC. Interestingly, in one patient with primary and recurrent metastatic tumors, we found evidence of polyclonal metastatic seeding, indicating that symbiotic communities of multiple clones existed and were maintained during metastasis. More realistically, some truncal alterations, such as IDH1, JAK1, and KRAS mutations and EGFR amplification, could be promising treatment targets in patients with ICC.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease effects up to 30% of the population but only a minority of cases develop liver disease. Our study has shown that established blood tests can be used in primary care to stratify patients with fatty liver disease, leading to a reduction in unnecessary referrals by 80% and greatly improving the detection of cases of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.
In this study, we investigate the role of lysyl oxidase-like protein 2 (LOXL2), an enzyme pivotal in the development of organ fibrosis, in the pathogenesis of cholangiopathies (diseases of bile ducts), such as primary sclerosing cholangitis. We found LOXL2 to be expressed in association with bile duct epithelial injury and uncovered mechanisms for its upregulation and the subsequent effects in vitro and in vivo. Our findings support testing of anti-LOXL2 treatment strategies for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Long noncoding RNAs play important roles in various biological processes. While long noncoding RNAs do not directly code proteins, they can regulate gene expression by diverse mechanisms. We identified the long noncoding RNA, termed lncHand2 because of its proximity to the gene Hand2, to be an important determinant of liver regeneration through c-Met signaling.
The most effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is surgical removal of the tumour but there is often recurrence. In this large international study, we develop a statistical method that allows clinicians to estimate the risk of recurrence in an individual patient. This facility enhances communication with the patient about the likely success of the treatment and will help in designing clinical trials that aim to find drugs that decrease the risk of recurrence.
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by fat accumulation in liver cells, which leads to inflammation and fibrosis. Emricasan was previously shown to inhibit some of the liver enzymes which lead to liver inflammation and fibrosis. In this study, emricasan did not improve liver inflammation or fibrosis in patients with NASH and pre-existing liver fibrosis.
There is a need for transarterial regimens that improve the responses and survival of patients with unresectable HCC. In this phase I trial, we showed that two sessions of treatment with a transarterial idarubicin_lipiodol emulsion without embolisation was well tolerated and gave promising efficacy in terms of tumour control and patient survival.
This study assesses the changes to structure, blood flow and perfusion that occur in the key organs (liver, spleen and kidney) associated with severe liver disease (Compensated Cirrhosis), using magnetic resonance imaging. The magnetic resonance imaging measures which changed with disease severity and were related to negative liver-related clinical outcomes are described.
Over the last decade, liver transplantation of sicker, older patient with multiple co-morbidities has increased. In this study, we show that a set of recipient factors (recipient age >60 years, ventilator status, diabetes, hemodialysis and creatinine >1.5 mg/dl) can help identify patients that may not do well after transplant. Transplanting sicker organs in patients with certain combinations of these characteristics leads to lower survival.
Individuals diagnosed with classic alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (ZZ) are at risk of liver injury and scarring, because of the accumulation of abnormal alpha-1 antitrypsin in the liver. A liver biopsy in ZZ individuals can demonstrate the accumulation of alpha-1 antitrypsin within the liver and identify if any associated liver scarring is present. Indviduals with large amounts of alpha-1 antitrypsin on biopsy may be at risk of liver injury and fibrosis. Additional common medical conditions of diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol, and hypertension (known as metabolic syndrome) are associated with a greater degree of liver injury.
Liver fibrosis majorly contributes to mortality resulting from various liver diseases. We discovered a small RNA known as miRNA-221-3p, whose downregulation in hepatocytes results in reduced liver fibrosis. Thus, inhibition of miRNA-221-3p may serve as one of the therapeutic approaches for treatment of liver fibrosis.
The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has increased dramatically in parallel with the worldwide increase in obesity and diabetes. Its progressive form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, is a growing indication for liver transplantation in Europe, with good overall outcomes reported. However, careful risk factor assessment is required to maintain favourable post-transplant outcomes in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.
Hepatocellular carcinomas with histologic evidence of abundant immune cell infiltration are characterized by frequent activation of Epstein-Barr virus in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and less aggressive clinical behavior. However, a high density of Epstein-Barr virus-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is associated with inferior prognostic outcomes, possibly as a result of immune escape due to significant CD8 T cell exhaustion
GS-9620 is a drug currently being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. GS-9620 has previously been shown to suppress HBV in various animal models, but the underlying antiviral mechanisms were not completely understood. In this study, we determined that GS-9620 does not directly activate antiviral pathways in human liver cells, but can induce prolonged suppression of HBV via induction of an antiviral cytokine called interferon. However, interferon did not destroy the HBV genome, suggesting that other parts of the immune response (e.g. activation of immune cells that kill infected cells) also play an important role in the antiviral response to GS-9620.
There are currently no pharmacological treatment options for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is now the most frequent liver disease. Necroptosis is a regulated process of cell death that can occur in hepatocytes during NAFLD. Herein, we show that RIPK1, a gatekeeper of the necroptosis pathway that is activated in NAFLD, can be inhibited by RIPA-56 to reduce not only liver injury, inflammation and fibrosis, but also steatosis in experimental models. These results highlight the potential of RIPK1 as a therapeutic target in NAFLD.
Herein, we have defined a homogeneous subgroup of hepatocellular carcinomas in which the BAP1 gene is inactivated. This leads to the development of cancers with features similar to those of fibrolamellar carcinoma. These tumors more frequently develop in females without chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. The presence of PKA activation and T cell infiltrates suggest that these tumors could be treated with PKA inhibitors or immunomodulators.
Children with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have a higher prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance (prediabetes or type 2 diabetes) than children without NAFLD. Children with biopsy-proven NAFLD and abnormal glucose tolerance also have a higher prevalence of the progressive form of disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, than those with normal glucose tolerance, though central adiposity is the factor that is most strongly associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a cancer arising in the bile ducts inside (intrahepatic CCA) and connected to the liver (extrahepatic CCA). It is a very aggressive cancer: 95% of patients die within 5 years. CCA rates are increasing globally, but the causes of CCA are poorly understood. The few risk factors that are known account for only a minority of cases. In this study, we found that the strongest risk factors for both intrahepatic and extrahepatic CCA are cysts and stones in the bile ducts, cirrhosis, and hepatitis B and C viruses. Some risk factors for CCA, such as diabetes, although less strong, are increasing globally and may be contributing to rising rates of CCA.
The lack of optimized public health screening strategies for the detection of liver fibrosis in adults without known liver disease presents a major healthcare challenge. Analyses from 6 independent international cohorts, with transient elastography measurements, show that a community-based risk-stratification strategy for alcohol-related and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases is cost-effective and potentially cost saving for our healthcare systems, as it leads to earlier identification of patients.
Herein, we reveal a new mechanism for cholesterol gallstone formation, in which increased paracellular phosphate ion permeability across hepatobiliary epithelia causes calcium phosphate core formation and cholesterol gallstones. Thus, altered phosphate ion metabolism under cholesterol overdose plays a major role in the lifestyle- and age-related risks of developing cholesterol gallstone disease.
Liver function may abruptly deteriorate in patients with chronic liver disease with cirrhosis, often resulting in these patients being admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with organ failure. Previous studies have indicated that this sudden deterioration, called acute-on-chronic liver failure is associated with very high mortality rates, which often resulted in deferred ICU care because of a perception of futility. Our study now shows that the ICU course and outcome are not different when patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure are compared to other ICU patients matched for severity of illness. This demonstrates that patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure deserve the same ICU care given to other ICU populations.
Sorafenib has been the standard frontline systemic treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma for over a decade. Its tolerability is limited by different adverse events, which might lead to its permanent discontinuation in a sizeable proportion of patients. After a careful analysis of potential confounders, we demonstrated that the physicians’ experience in managing adverse events related to sorafenib has improved over time, with longer treatment periods and less permanent discontinuation for toxicities. More importantly, these improvements also translated into longer patient survival. Our results have relevant repercussions in clinical practice and in the design of future clinical trials.
Biliary atresia is a disease that affects newborns and is characterized by extrahepatic bile duct injury and obstruction, resulting in liver injury. We identify 4 key differences between the epithelial and submucosal layers of the neonatal and adult extrahepatic bile duct and show that these may render the neonatal duct particularly susceptible to injury.
This study looks at patients who require a liver transplant to save their lives; this liver can be donated by a person who has died either after their heart has stopped (donation after cardiac death [DCD]) or after the brain has been injured and can no longer support life (donation after brainstem death [DBD]). We know that livers donated after brainstem death function better than those after cardiac death, but there are not enough of these livers for everyone, so we wished to help patients decide whether it was better for them to accept an early offer of a DCD liver than waiting longer to receive a “better” liver from a DBD donor. We found that patients were more likely to survive if they accepted the offer of a liver transplant as soon as possible (DCD or DBD), especially if their liver disease was very severe.
Mouse models are widely used to study the biology of cancer and to test potential therapies. Herein, we have described the mutational landscape of tumours arising in a carcinogen-induced mouse model of liver cancer. Since cancer is a disease caused by genomic alterations, information about the patterns and types of mutations in the tumours in this mouse model should facilitate its use to study human liver cancer.
Hepatitis B virus can be a progressive disease leading to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplant, and death. These progressive disease states are associated with a higher rate of hospitalizations, emergency room visits, outpatient visits, and costs compared to similar patients without hepatitis B. The most ill patients have the highest costs, but even patients who are less sick experience higher costs than patients without hepatitis B.
Dysregulation of bile acid metabolism and T cells can contribute to the development of cholangiopathies. Before targeting T cells for the treatment of cholangiopathies, it should be determined whether they exert protective effects on bile acid metabolism. Herein, we demonstrate that T cell-induced cholangitis resulted in decreased levels of harmful unconjugated bile acids. T cells were able to directly control synthesis and metabolism of bile acids, a process which was dependent on the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IFN-γ. Understanding the effect of lymphocytes on bile acid metabolism will help in the design of combined treatment strategies for cholestatic liver diseases.
Efavirenz is widely prescribed for HIV-infected patients but has some side effects. It can increase lipid levels in patients’ blood and liver. Here we show that efavirenz can activate a unique liver protein called PXR which mediates the adverse effects of efavirenz on lipid levels in mouse models.
Irisin is a novel protein produced mainly by muscle, which is known to be released into the circulation, with an unclear role in liver fat deposition. This study demonstrates that genetic variants in the gene encoding the irisin protein modulate the risk of liver fat in patients with fatty liver disease. Interestingly, these effects are independent of, but additive to those of other recently described genetic variants that contribute to liver fat. In functional studies, we have deciphered the detailed molecular mechanisms by which this genetic variant mediates its effects.
Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3) is a severe genetic liver disease that results from impaired transport of lipids to bile, which makes the bile toxic to liver cells. Because therapeutic options are currently limited, this study aims to evaluate gene therapy to correct the underlying genetic defect in a mouse model of this disease. By introducing a functional copy of the missing gene in liver cells of mice, we were able to restore lipid transport to bile and strongly reduce damage to the liver. The proliferation of liver cells was also reduced, which contributes to long-term correction of the phenotype. Further studies are required to evaluate whether this approach can be applied to patients with PFIC3.
The prognosis of patients with severe comorbidities may not benefit from HCV viral clearance. An algorithm to decide who will benefit from the treatment is needed to manage the chronic HCV infection better.
Patients with biliary atresia commonly require liver transplantation before reaching adulthood. Those who reach adulthood with their own liver are still at risk of needing a transplant. This study aimed to identify tests that could help clinicians predict which patients with biliary atresia who reach the age of 16 without a transplant will require one in later life. The study found that the presence of bilirubin ≥21 µmol/L, lower creatinine levels, and a history of portal hypertension or gastro-oesophageal varices at 16 years, as well as cholangitis in adolescence, could predict the future likelihood of needing a liver transplant for young people with biliary atresia.
γδ T cells are frequently enriched in many solid tissues, however the immunobiology of such tissue-associated subsets in humans has remained unclear. We show that intrahepatic γδ T cells are enriched for clonally expanded effector T cells, whereas naïve γδ T cells are largely excluded. Moreover, whereas a distinct proportion of circulating T cell clonotypes was present in both the liver tissue and peripheral blood, a functionally and clonotypically distinct population of liver-resident γδ T cells was also evident. Our findings suggest that factors triggering γδ T cell clonal selection and differentiation, such as infection, can drive enrichment of γδ T cells into liver tissue, allowing the development of functionally distinct tissue-restricted memory populations specialised in local hepatic immunosurveillance.
There is currently no prognostic model specifically developed for recommended or ideal transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) candidates with hepatocellular carcinoma, despite these patients being frequently identified as the best target population in pivotal randomized controlled trials. The six-and-twelve score provides patient survival prediction, especially in ideal candidates of TACE, outperforming other currently available models in both training and validation sets, as well as different subgroups. With cut-off values of 6 and 12, the score can stratify ideal TACE candidates into 3 strata with significantly different outcomes and may shed light on risk stratification of these patients in clinical practice as well as in clinical trials.
This study represents the most extensive pre-clinical characterization of anti-ANXA3 monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma to date. These results support the clinical trial development of anti-ANXA3 antibodies in combination with sorafenib/regorafenib. Further studies will optimize patient target selection and identify the best treatment combinations.
Rising hepatitis C-related morbidity and mortality is a major public health issue. However, development of highly effective medicines against hepatitis C (called direct-acting antivirals or DAAs) means hepatitis C could be eliminated as a public health threat by 2030. This study shows a sharp decline in liver disease morbidity and mortality since the introduction of DAAs in New South Wales, Australia. Despite this, heavy alcohol use remains an important risk factor for liver disease among people with hepatitis C. To ensure that the benefits of new antiviral treatments are not compromised, management of major comorbidities, including heavy alcohol use must improve among people with hepatitis C.
Non-selective beta-blockers are the mainstay of primary prophylaxis to prevent variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and high-risk esophageal varices. This prospective study showed that a prediction model based on changes in spleen stiffness before vs. after dose titration might be a non-invasive marker for response to prophylactic non-selective beta-blocker (carvedilol) therapy in patients with cirrhosis and high-risk esophageal varices.
Patients with liver cirrhosis frequently exhibit hyperammonemia and suffer from cognitive and motoric dysfunctions, which at least in part involve premature ageing of the astrocytes in the brain. This study identifies glucosamine and an O-GlcNAcylation-dependent disruption of iron homeostasis as novel triggers of oxidative stress, thereby mediating ammonia toxicity in the brain.
microRNAs are deregulated in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The microRNAs, miRNA-34a, miRNA-122 and miRNA-192, were identified as potential biomarkers of non-alcoholic fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, at different stages of disease severity. The correlation between miRNA expression in the serum and in liver tissue was inconsistent, or even inverse.
Chronic hepatitis B virus infection (CHB) is characterized by a dysfunctional immune response. In patients with CHB, inhibitory receptors, such as programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) are overexpressed on T cells, leading to an ineffective immune response in the liver. Herein, we show that the PD-1 inhibitor, nivolumab, is safe and effective for the treatment of virally suppressed patients with CHB.
Our clinical study suggests a negative association between prolactin (PRL)/prolactin receptor (PRLR) and the presence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Using cell experiments, we found that PRL ameliorates hepatic steatosis via the hepatic PRLR and fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36, a key transporter of free fatty acid uptake in liver. Our findings suggest a novel approach to improving NAFLD using PRL and PRLR
Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD1a) is a rare metabolic disease characterized by hypoglycemia, steatosis, excessive glycogen accumulation and tumor development in the liver. In this study, we have observed that GSDIa livers reprogram their metabolism in a similar way to cancer cells, which facilitates tumor formation and progression, in the absence of hepatic fibrosis. Moreover, hepatic burden due to overload of glycogen and lipids in the cells leads to a decrease in cellular defenses, such as autophagy, which could further promote tumorigenesis in the case of GSDI.
Hepatitis C infection can be cured with currently available antiviral agents. Only a small proportion of patients experience treatment failure, however, in absolute numbers, a high number of patients may require retreatment. Highly effective combinations of antivirals are also available for retreatment. However, these antivirals might not be available in resource-limited settings. Herein, we show how, by analyzing the cause of resistance, retreatment efficacy with old drugs can get very close to the efficacy of new drug combinations.
Despite strong evidence of omega-3 fatty acids having liver-directed, anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative action in various rodent models, 2 single omega-3 fatty acid infusions given to patients before and during liver surgery failed to reduce complications. Because single omega-3 fatty acid infusions failed to confer liver protection in this trial, they cannot currently be recommended.
Porphyrias are disorders resulting from abnormalities in the steps that lead to heme production, which cause build-up of toxic by-products called porphyrins. Liver is commonly either a source or a target of excess porphyrins, and complications can range from minor abnormalities to liver failure. In this report, we inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling in an experimental model of porphyria, which resulted in decreased liver injury. Targeting β-catenin affected multiple components of the heme biosynthesis pathway, thus preventing build-up of porphyrin intermediates. Our study suggests that drugs inhibiting β-catenin activity could reduce the amount of porphyrin accumulation and help alleviate symptoms in patients with porphyria.
IL-17A is a tumor-promoting cytokine, which critically regulates inflammatory responses in macrophages (Kupffer cells and bone-marrow-derived monocytes) and cholesterol synthesis in steatotic hepatocytes in an experimental model of alcohol-induced HCC. Therefore, IL-17A may be a potential therapeutic target for patients with alcohol-induced HCC.
New therapies to treat chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are urgently needed. In this study we performed a retrospective analysis of liver and blood samples from a chimpanzee model of CHB to help understand how GS-9620, a drug in clinical trials, suppressed hepatitis B virus (HBV). We found that the antiviral response to GS-9620 was associated with accumulation of immune cells in the liver that can either kill cells infected with HBV or can produce antibodies that may prevent HBV from infecting new liver cells. These findings have important implications for how GS-9620 may be used in patients and may also help guide the development of new therapies to treat chronic HBV infection.
The overall health of liver transplant recipients could be assessed by a simple clinical assessment tool called the Karnofsky performance status, which assesses an individual’s overall functional status on an 11-point scale, in increments of 10, where a score of 0 is considered dead and 100 is considered perfect health. In this study, using a large dataset, we show that the performance status before and after liver transplant is a predictor of survival. More importantly, those who have low performance status before transplant and do not show an improvement in performance status between 3–12 months after liver transplant have very poor survival.
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is a combination direct-acting antiviral that is approved for treatment of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Despite the lack of dosing recommendations, sofosbuvir-containing regimens (including sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) are frequently used for HCV-infected patients undergoing dialysis. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks in patients with HCV infection who were undergoing dialysis. Treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was safe and well tolerated, resulting in a cure rate of 95% in patients with HCV infection and end-stage renal disease.
We detected no significant difference in early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence rates and patterns between patients who received interferon-based and direct-acting antiviral therapy after HCC treatment. High lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of alpha-fetoprotein level, short recurrence-free period, and a history of multiple HCC treatments were independent risk factors for early HCC recurrence after the initiation of antiviral therapy.
Tertiary lymphoid structures provide a critical microenvironment for generating anti-tumor immune responses, and are associated with improved clinical outcome in most cancers investigated. Their role in hepatocellular carcinoma is however debated. We show in the present study that intra-tumoral tertiary lymphoid structures are associated with a low risk of early relapse after surgical resection, suggesting that they reflect the existence of in situ, effective anti-tumor immunity.
Significant liver damage and cirrhosis of the liver may develop without a known cause – a liver disease referred to as cryptogenic cirrhosis. In this work we found that, in the presence of metabolic abnormalities, cryptogenic cirrhosis may actually be a part of the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease spectrum. Yet, it appears to be more progressive than typical non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, leading to advanced liver disease at a faster rate.
Protection of viral infection necessitates the production of antibodies that are generated by specialized cells of the immune system called B cells. During chronic HBV infection, antibodies against the internal part of the virus (core or HBcAg) are detectable while the antibodies directed against the virus envelope (surface or HBsAg) are not present. Here we developed a method that allows us to directly visualize ex vivo the B cells specific for these 2 viral components, highlighting their differences and similarities, and showing how 2 components of the same virus can have different impacts on the function of antiviral B cells.
Postoperative hepatitis B virus reactivation was associated with an increased complication rate and a decreased survival rate after liver resection in patients with ICC and hepatitis B virus infection. Antiviral therapy before liver resection reduced the risk of postoperative viral reactivation. Both pre- and postoperative antiviral therapy was effective in prolonging patient survival.
Multiple organ failures, ranging from 1–6, are common in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis. The survival without liver transplant is dismal in the presence of three or more organ failures. Small retrospective studies have shown that liver transplant is feasible with good outcomes even in the presence of multiple organ failures. In this study, using a large national dataset, we show that survival chances for more than 30 days in those with three or more organ failures are less than 8%. However, if a liver transplant is performed quickly, the survival chances are very high with one-year survival ranging from 84% with three organ failures to 81% with 5–6 organ failures.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now recognized as the most prevalent chronic liver disease worldwide. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an important risk factor for NAFLD. Additionally, T2DM seems to accelerate the progression of liver disease in NAFLD. Despite the high prevalence and serious clinical implications of NAFLD in patients with T2DM, it is usually overlooked in clinical practice. This meta‐analysis provides evidence of the high prevalence of NAFLD and NASH in patients with T2DM. In this context, increasing awareness about the importance of NAFLD in patients with T2DM among all important stakeholders (primary care physicians, specialists, and health policy makers) must be prioritized.
Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a condition marked by multiple organ failures in patients with cirrhosis and associated with a high risk of death. In this study of US patients hospitalised with cirrhosis, 1 in 4 patients developed ACLF. In total, 25% of patients with ACLF died within 1 month and 40% died within 3 months. Thus, early recognition of ACLF is important for the initiation of aggressive management, which is required to save these patients’ lives.
The sequence of events in chronic hepatic encephalopathy (HE) remains unclear, therefore using the advantages of in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 9.4T we aimed to test the hypothesis that neurometabolic changes are detectable very early in an established model of type C HE, offering insight into the primary events underpinning HE, before advanced liver disease confounds the findings. These early, previously unreported neurometabolic changes occurred as early as 2 to 4 weeks after bile-duct ligation, namely an increase in plasma ammonium and brain glutamine, a decrease in brain creatine and ascorbate together with behavioural and astrocyte morphology changes, and continued to progress throughout the 8-week course of the disease.
Dysregulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 molecular pathway has been observed in human tumors. In a nutritional model of hepatocarcinogenesis, the protein Nrf2 is frequently mutated/activated at early steps of the tumorigenic process. Herein, we show that Nrf2 is mandatory for the development of preneoplastic lesions. These results suggest that Nrf2 has a critical role in the onset of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Using a combination of tracers 18F-fluorocholine and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose when performing positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), often called a PET scan, helps to identify new tumor lesions in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. This technique enabled staging modification of patients� tumors and led to changes in treatment allocation in certain patients.
Cholangiocarcinoma is a highly malignant cancer affecting the biliary tree, which is characterized by a rich stromal reaction involving a dense population of cancer-associated fibroblasts that promote early metastatic spread. Herein, we show that cholangiocarcinoma-derived PDGF-D stimulates fibroblasts to secrete vascular growth factors. Thus, targeting fibroblasts or PDGF-D-induced signals may represent an effective tool to block tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis and reduce the invasiveness of cholangiocarcinoma.
The CheckMate 040 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of nivolumab in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who were refractory to previous sorafenib treatment or chemotherapy. This subanalysis of the data showed that treatment responses and safety in patients in Asia were similar to those of the overall treatment population, providing support for nivolumab as a treatment option for these patients.
Alcoholic hepatitis is a life-threatening condition with no approved therapy that occurs unexpectedly in people who consume excess alcohol. The liver makes many metabolites, and we demonstrate that loss of one such metabolite β-hydroxybutyrate occurs in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. This loss can increase alcohol-induced liver injury, and β-hydroxybutyrate can protect from alcohol-induced liver injury via a receptor on liver macrophages. This opens the possibility of metabolite-based therapy for alcoholic hepatitis.
Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury is a serious complication that occurs in liver surgery. Herein, we demonstrated that inducible prostaglandin E2 synthase (mPGES-1), an enzyme involved in synthesizing prostaglandin E2, worsens the injury and delays liver repair through accumulation of proinflammatory macrophages. Inhibition of mPGES-1 offers a potential therapy for both liver protection and repair in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury.
Viral infection can cause fulminant hepatitis, which in turn is a major cause of acute liver failure. Herein, we aimed to study the role of type 1 interferon responses in acute viral hepatitis. We identified that during infection with DNA-encoded viruses, type 1 interferon receptor triggering of blood monocytes delays the development of monocyte-derived Kupffer cells. This points to new therapeutic strategies for acute viral hepatitis.
After the advent of direct-acting antivirals in 2014, a dramatic decline was observed in the number of liver transplants performed both in patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus (HCV), minus 60%, and in those with hepatocellular carcinoma associated with HCV, minus 41%. Furthermore, this is the first large-scale study demonstrating that the survival of liver transplant recipients with HCV-related liver disease has dramatically improved over the last three years and is now comparable to the survival of recipients with hepatitis B virus infection. The reduction in HCV-related indications for LT means that there is a greater availability of livers, at least 600 every year, which can be allocated to patients with indications other than HCV.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a heterogeneous disease associated with a poor prognosis. In patients with HCC, TLR3 downregulation is associated with reduced survival. Herein, we show that the absence of TLR3 is associated with a lower rate of apoptosis, and subsequently more rapid hepatocarcinogenesis, without any change to the immune infiltrate in the liver. Therefore, the poor prognosis associated with low TLR3 expression in HCC is likely linked to tumors ability to escape apoptosis. TLR3 may become a promising therapeutic target in TLR3-positive HCC.
We created and analysed a dataset from 12 countries with 66,640 participants with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. We determined that about 97% of those with viraemic infection had 1,300 IU/ml or more of circulating virus at the time of diagnosis. While current diagnostic tests can detect as little as 12 IU/ml of virus, our findings suggest that increasing the level of detection closer to 1,300 IU/ml would maintain good test accuracy and will likely enable development of more affordable portable tests for use in low- and middle-income countries.
Loss of caspase 8 – a protein involved in programmed cell death – in liver parenchymal cells protects against experimental cholestasis. Therefore, specific pharmacological intervention against caspase 8 might be a valid alternative for the treatment of obstructive cholestasis in the clinic, whereas broad pan-caspase inhibiting drugs might trigger undesirable side effects.
We investigated the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in HIV/hepatitis B virus-coinfected individuals from a large multi-cohort study in Europe. Over 32,673 patient-years, 60 individuals (1.7%) developed hepatocellular carcinoma. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma remained low in patients without cirrhosis, who started on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate when aged <46 years old.
Direct-acting antiviral medications are able to cure hepatitis C in the majority of patients. The most common genotype of hepatitis C in Europe and the United States is genotype 1a or 1b and most clinical trials focused on these genotypes. We report that in a group of African patients, most of them had unusual (non-1a/1b) genotype 1 subtypes, and that the cure rate in these unusual genotypes was lower than in genotypes 1a and 1b.
Cirrhosis is a risk factor for primary liver cancer, leading to recommendations for periodic screening. However, for alcohol-related liver disease the rational of periodic screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial, as registry and databased studies have suggested a low incidence of HCC in these patients and highly competitive mortality rates. In this study, a large cohort of patients with biopsy-proven alcoholic cirrhosis prospectively screened for HCC demonstrated a high annual incidence of HCC (2.9%) and a high percentage of small cancers theoretically eligible for curative treatment. This suggests that patients with liver disease related to alcohol should not be ruled out of screening.
A locus in the human leukocyte antigen gene (HLA-A*33:01, B*14:02, C*08:02) was significantly overrepresented in Caucasian and African American patients with liver injury attributed to the antifungal medication, terbinafine. These data along with the molecular docking studies demonstrate that this genetic polymorphism is a plausible risk factor for developing terbinafine hepatotoxicity and could be used in the future to help doctors make a diagnosis more rapidly and confidently.
Real-time metabolomic profiles of human grafts during back-table can accurately predict graft dysfunction. High lactate and phosphocholine content are highly predictive of graft dysfunction whereas low lactate and phosphocholine content characterize patients with sarcopenia. In these patients, the cost of metabolic adaptation may explain the poor outcomes.
Abundant TOX expression in CD8+ T cells impairs their antitumor function in hepatocellular carcinoma. Mechanically, TOX reduces PD1 degradation and promotes PD1 translocation to the cell surface in CD8+ T cells, thus maintaining high PD1 expression at the cell surface. Downregulating TOX expression improves the antitumor function of CD8+ T cells, which shows the synergetic role of anti-PD1 therapy, highlighting a promising strategy for enhancement of cancer immunotherapy.
The most effective treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is surgical removal of the tumor but often recurrence occurs, partly due to the presence of microvascular invasion (MVI). Lacking a single highly reliable factor able to preoperatively predict MVI, we developed a computational approach to predict MVI and the long-term clinical outcome of patients with HCC. In particular, the added value of radiomics, a newly emerging form of radiography, was comprehensively investigated. This computational method can enhance the communication with the patient about the likely success of the treatment and guide clinical management, with the aim of finding drugs that reduce the risk of recurrence.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by biliary inflammation and fibrosis, whose current medical treatment is hardly effective. We observed an increased interferon (IFN)-γ response in patients with PSC and in a mouse model of sclerosing cholangitis. IFNγ changed the phenotype of hepatic CD8+ T lymphocytes and NK cells towards increased cytotoxicity, and its absence decreased liver cell death, reduced frequencies of inflammatory macrophages in the liver and attenuated liver fibrosis. Therefore, IFNγ-dependent immune responses may disclose checkpoints for future therapeutic intervention strategies in sclerosing cholangitis.
Acetaminophen (APAP) induced acute liver failure because of over dose is a leading public health problem. APAP-induced liver injury exhibits diurnal variation, specifically APAP causes more severe liver damage when taken at night compared with in the morning. Herein, we showed that gut microbial metabolite, 1-phenyl-1,2-propanedione is involved in the rhythmic hepatotoxicity induced by APAP, by depleting hepatic glutathione (an important antioxidant) levels. Our data suggest gut microbiota may be a potential target for reducing APAP-induced acute liver injury.
The mechanical properties of cells and tissues (i.e. whether they are soft or stiff) are thought to be important regulators of cell behavior. Herein, we found that inactivation of the protein CAPZ alters the mechanical properties of cells and liver tissues, leading to YAP hyperactivation. In turn, this profoundly alters liver physiology, causing organ overgrowth, defects in liver cell differentiation and metabolism. These results reveal a previously uncharacterized role for mechanical signals in the maintenance of adult liver homeostasis
A large number of patients with hepatitis C virus have been treated with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) within the NAVIGATORE-Lombardia Network, in Italy. This is the first real-world study evaluating effectiveness and safety of G/P in patients with hepatitis C virus treated according to international recommendations. This study demonstrated excellent effectiveness (with sustained virological response rates of 99.3%) and safety profiles.
Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the complications of hepatitis C related cirrhosis. Treating patients with advanced hepatitis C with the new interferon�free direct-acting antiviral agents has been associated with improvement in liver function and survival, while more conflicting data have been reported regarding the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. We report the results of a prospective population study on the incidence of newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with advanced hepatitis C treated with direct-acting antiviral agents, clearly indicating that the residual hepatocellular carcinoma risk is reduced and declines progressively with time after a sustained virological response. Development of a liver tumor during/after therapy was associated with known risk factors and with virological failure.
The liver, the primary organ for ethanol metabolism, can be damaged by the byproducts of ethanol metabolism, including reactive oxygen species. In this study, we have identified a key epigenetic regulator SIRT6 that plays a critical role in protecting the liver from oxidative stress-induced liver injury. Thus, our data suggest that SIRT6 may be a potential therapeutic target for alcohol-related liver disease.
We performed whole-exome sequencing in 19 adult patients with unexplained liver disease after an unrevealing conventional work-up performed by a hepatologist. In 5 cases, genomic analysis led to a diagnosis and informed treatment and management of the disease. Therefore, we suggest using whole-exome sequencing in the evaluation and management of adults with unexplained liver disease.
Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) is as an important modulator of polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN)-induced liver injury, which occurs in ischemia-reperfusion. Here, we show that the NOD1 pathway targets liver adhesion molecule expression on the endothelium and on hepatocytes through p38 and ERK signaling pathways. The early increase of adhesion molecule expression after reperfusion emphasizes the importance of adhesion molecules in liver injury. In this study we generated nanoparticles loaded with NOD1 antagonist. These nanoparticles reduced liver necrosis by reducing PMN liver infiltration and adhesion molecule expression.
For patients with unresectable malignant biliary obstruction (MBO), placement of a self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) is a recommended palliative modality to relieve pruritus, cholangitis, pain, and jaundice. However, restenosis is a main pitfall after stent placement. Data from this first multicenter randomized controlled trial showed that insertion of an irradiation stent provided longer patency and better survival than a conventional metal stent.
This study compared the gene expression and protein profiles of healthy liver cells and those affected by the inherited disease α1-antitrypsin deficiency. This approach identified specific factors primarily present in diseased samples which could provide new targets for drug development. This study also demonstrates the interest of using hepatic cells generated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells to model liver disease in vitro for uncovering new mechanisms with clinical relevance.
The risk of de novo hepatitis B infection after liver transplantation was rare when using hepatitis B core positive liver grafts with entecavir monotherapy prophylaxis. Hepatitis B core antibody status did not impact on perioperative and long-term outcomes after liver transplantation. This provides support for the clinical use of hepatitis B core positive liver grafts when required.
Washout on MRI is depicted in a significant proportion of benign nodules in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS), limiting its value for the differentiation between benign and malignant lesions. Criteria proposed for the non-invasive diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis cannot be extrapolated to patients with BCS. Additional imaging findings and patient characteristics, including alpha-fetoprotein serum level, can help determine the probability of a nodule being HCC in patients with BCS.
Excess liver iron content is common and is associated with liver diseases and metabolic diseases including diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. We identified 3 genetic variants that are linked to an increased risk of developing higher liver iron content. We show that the same genetic variants are linked to higher risk of many diseases, but they may also be associated with some health advantages. Finally, we use genetic variants associated with waist-to-hip ratio as a tool to show that central obesity is causally associated with increased liver iron content.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a heterogeneous disease driven by the concomitant deregulation of several genes functionally organized as networks. Here, we identified a gene regulatory network involved in a subset of HCCs. This subset is characterized by increased proliferation and poor prognosis. We developed a mathematical model which uncovers the dynamics of the network and allows us to predict the impact of a therapeutic agent, not only on its specific target but on all the genes belonging to the network.
Neutralising antibodies will likely form a key component of a protective hepatitis C virus vaccine. In this work we characterise the predominant neutralising and non-neutralising antibody (epitope) targets in acute hepatitis C virus infection. We have defined the natural hierarchy of epitope immunodominance, and demonstrated that viral genotype can impact on this hierarchy. Our findings highlight key epitopes that are associated with broadly neutralising antibodies, and the deleterious impact of mounting a response towards some of these domains on neutralising breadth. These findings should guide future efforts to design immunogens aimed at generating neutralising antibodies with a vaccine candidate.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles may associate with apoB and acquire neutral lipids after exiting cells, giving them low-buoyant density. The hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) is a majorviral determinant of E2 that controls this process. Besides lipoproteins, specific serum factors including albumin promote extracellular maturation of HCV virions. HCV particle production in vitro, with media of defined serum conditions, enables production of infectious particles resembling those of chronically infected patients.
This study identifies a key role for syntenin in the regulation of E2 secretion via exosomes. Efficient production of E2-coated exosomes was shown to make hepatitis C virus less sensitive to antibody neutralization. These results may have implications for the development of a hepatitis C virus vaccine.
Macro-vacuolar liver steatosis is a major prognostic factor for outcomes after liver transplantation. However, it is often difficult for logistical reasons to get this estimation during procurement. Therefore, we developed an algorithm for a commercial, portable and affordable spectrometer to accurately estimate this content in a real-time fashion. This device could be of great interest for clinical decision-making to accept or discard a potential human liver graft.
Increased levels of fat in the liver impair the ability of the cardiovascular system to work properly. The amount of fat in the liver, metabolic control, inflammation and alcohol are all linked to the degree that the cardiovascular system is affected.
The early stages of human liver development were modeled using human hepatic organoids. We identified a pathway that was essential for early liver development. Based upon this finding, a novel combination drug therapy was identified that could be used to treat primary liver cancer and possibly other types of cancer.
This study describes diverse compounds that act as HCV membrane fusion inhibitors. It defines viral properties that determine sensitivity to these molecules and thus provides information to identify patients that may benefit from treatment with membrane fusion inhibitors.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition highly prevalent in obese and/or diabetic patients, is emerging as an independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease. Herein, we demonstrated that extracellular vesicles, released by hepatocytes under NAFLD conditions, cause vascular endothelial inflammation and promote atherosclerosis. Within these toxic vesicles, we identified a small molecular cargo that acted as a potent inducer of endothelial inflammation. By inhibiting this cargo’s function, a specific gene-based inhibitor profoundly attenuated atherogenesis in mice, uncovering a novel mechanism which may be used to prevent or treat cardiovascular disease in patients with NAFLD.
Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) plays a key role in antigen presentation. Genetic variants of ERAP1 (leading to distinct allotypes) are linked with specific autoinflammatory disorders, such as ankylosing spondylitis and Behçet’s disease. We found that ERAP1 allotypes modified the repertoire of virus-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes in a patient with hepatitis C virus, leading to an altered pattern of immunodominance that may have contributed to the failure of antiviral immunity in this patient.
Fontan surgery is the standard of care for many patients with univentricular congenital cardiopathies. Recent advances have improved the survival of Fontan patients, and nowadays most of them reach adulthood. In this setting, Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD) is increasingly recognised, and has become a significant prognostic factor. Liver nodules are considered a component of FALD yet their prevalence, imaging features and predictors have hardly been evaluated. In this study, we observed that liver nodules are frequent, typically hyperechoic, hypervascular and predominantly peripheral in patients with FALD. This population is at risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, the diagnosis of which must be confirmed by biopsy.
Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complication of advanced liver disease that can manifest as excessive sleepiness. Some patients with HE have been shown to have difficulty driving. Herein, we used a test called the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), which measures sleepiness and can also be used to assess driving competence. We showed that PVT performance is fairly stable in healthy individuals. We also showed that PVT performance parallels performance in tests which are commonly used in cirrhotic patients to measure HE. We suggest that this test is helpful in quantifying HE and identifying dangerous drivers among patients with cirrhosis.
Patients and their families had a poor understanding of advanced liver disease and its impact on them. They need more information about the treatments they receive and how to get practical and psychological support. Liver specialists and GPs found it difficult to talk to patients and their families about the seriousness of advanced liver disease and the lack of healthcare options available to them if their condition gets worse. All doctors and nurses involved in the care of patients with advanced liver disease recognise that palliative and supportive care have an important role in improving patient care.
Herein, we report that a cell adhesion molecule termed integrin β1 (ITGβ1) plays a key role in the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). ITGβ1 is released from hepatocytes under lipotoxic stress as a cargo of extracellular vesicles, and mediates monocyte adhesion to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, which is an essential step in hepatic inflammation. In a mouse model of NASH, blocking ITGβ1 reduces liver inflammation, injury and fibrosis. Hence, ITGβ1 inhibition may serve as a new therapeutic strategy for NASH.
Cancer recurrence can occur after liver resection or liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study suggests that intestinal venous congestion, which often occurs during liver surgery, favors the translocation of gut-derived bacterial products in the portal vein, thereby facilitating cancer recurrence by enhancing the signaling of Toll-like receptor 4 in the liver. Using a mouse model of HCC recurrence, we show that strategies that (i) reduce bacterial translocation (by gut decontamination, or by protecting the intestine from venous ischemia damage) or (ii) inhibit Tlr4 signaling in the liver, could reduce cancer recurrence.
Patients with acute liver injury due to acetaminophen overdose have highly elevated levels of the platelet-adhesive protein von Willebrand factor. It is not known whether von Willebrand factor plays a direct role in the progression of acute liver injury. We discovered that von Willebrand factor delays repair of the acetaminophen-injured liver in mice and that targeting von Willebrand factor, even in mice with established liver injury, accelerates liver repair.
Activated portal fibroblasts and hepatic stellate cells, but not fibrocytes, contributed to the production of the fibrous scar in livers of Mdr2−/− mice, and these cells can serve as targets for antifibrotic therapy in cholestatic injury. Therapeutic inhibition of the enzyme NADPH oxidase (NOX) in Mdr2−/− mice reversed cholestatic fibrosis, suggesting that targeting NOXs may be an effective strategy for the treatment of cholestatic fibrosis.
The recent epidemic of obesity has been associated with a sharp rise in the incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the underlying mechanism(s) remains poorly described and effective therapeutic approaches against NAFLD are lacking. The results establish that microRNA-378 facilitates the development of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis and suggests the therapeutic potential of microRNA-378 inhibitor for the treatment of NAFLD.
Limited access to the diagnostic tools used to assess treatment eligibility (liver biopsy/Fibroscan/hepatitis B virus DNA) has been an obstacle to the scale up of hepatitis B treatment programs in low- and middle-income countries. Using the data from African patients with chronic HBV infection, we developed and validated a new simple diagnostic score for treatment eligibility, which only consists of hepatitis B virus e antigen and alanine aminotransferase level. The diagnostic accuracy of the score for selecting patients for HBV treatment was high and could be useful in African settings.
The ‘glymphatic system’ is a newly discovered brain-wide pathway that facilitates clearance of various substances that accumulate in the brain due to its activity. This study evaluated whether the function of this system is altered in a model of brain dysfunction that occurs in cirrhosis. For the first time, we identified that the clearance of substances from the brain in cirrhosis is reduced because this clearance system is defective. This study proposes a new mechanism of brain dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis and provides new targets for therapy.
The microenvironment is crucial for the self-renewal and development of hepatoma stem cells, which lead to the development of liver cancer. Lymphatic endothelial cells are an important component of this niche microenvironment, helping hepatoma stem cells to self-renew and escape immune attack, by upregulating IL-17A signaling. Thus, targeting IL-17A signaling is a potential strategy for the treatment of hepatoma.
In this study among patients with liver cirrhosis listed for liver transplantation, low skeletal muscle mass was associated with mortality on the waiting list, particularly in patients who were listed with low priority based on a low MELD score. However, adding these measurements to the currently used system for donor and organ allocation showed no added value.
Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global health problem, which can now be treated with potent direct-acting antiviral drugs. This study demonstrates that HCV infection in childhood causes serious liver disease in 32% of patients, a median of 33 years after infection, irrespective of age, mode and route of infection. Disease outcomes were better in patients treated before the development of advanced liver disease. Antiviral therapy should be made available in childhood to prevent long-term liver disease and the spread of HCV.
This paper reports a new zebrafish model that can be used to study the effects of diet on liver cancer. We found that a high-fat diet promotes non-resolving inflammation in the liver and enhances cancer progression. In addition, we found that metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes, inhibits high-fat diet-induced cancer progression in this model, by reducing diet-induced non-resolving inflammation and potentially restoring tumor surveillance.
Risk scores have been developed to predict the likelihood of patients with chronic hepatitis B developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated the role of 2 such scores, PAGE-B and modified PAGE-B, in predicting the risk of HCC in 32,150 nucleos(t)ide analogue-treated patients with chronic hepatitis B. These scores identified a group of patients at very low risk of developing HCC who could therefore be exempted from HCC surveillance.
High hepatic fat content is associated with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease. In the CENTRAL 18-month intervention trial, a Mediterranean/low-carbohydrate diet induced a greater decrease in hepatic fat content than a low-fat diet, conferring beneficial health effects that were beyond the favorable effects of visceral fat loss.
It is important to know the hepatitis B virus (HBV) status before starting corticosteroid therapy. Patients with resolved HBV infection without detectable immunity are at an increased risk of HBV surface antigen seroreversion after corticosteroid therapy. High peak daily doses of corticosteroids (>40 mg prednisolone equivalents) increase the risk of hepatitis flare, but not seroreversion, in patients with previous exposure to HBV, irrespective of the duration of treatment. Interval monitoring of liver biochemistries is essential for the early detection of hepatitis flares in these patients.
Fatty acid translocase CD36 (CD36) is a multifunctional membrane protein which contributes to the development of liver steatosis. In the present study, we demonstrated that the localization of CD36 on the plasma membrane of hepatocytes is increased in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Blocking the palmitoylation of CD36 reduces CD36 distribution in hepatocyte plasma membranes and protects mice from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The inhibition of CD36 palmitoylation not only improved fatty acid metabolic disorders but also reduced the inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo. The present study suggests that CD36 palmitoylation is important for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis development and inhibition of CD36 palmitoylation could be used to cure non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.
We conducted a survey on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with experts in European countries, coupled with data extracted from official documents on policies, clinical guidelines, awareness, and monitoring. We found a general lack of national policies, awareness campaigns and civil society involvement, and few epidemiological registries.
Despite hypothetical immunological concerns that the desensitization protocol for breaking through the ABO blood group barrier might have a negative impact on the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma, our experience demonstrated no significant differences in the long-term overall survival and recurrence-free survival rates between patients receiving ABO-compatible or ABO-incompatible liver transplantation. In conclusion, results from our institution indicated that ABO-incompatible living-donor liver transplantation constitutes a potentially feasible option for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, especially those with compensated cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma within conventional Milan criteria.
First-generation insulin sensitizers are used to treat type 2 diabetes, but are associated with side effects including edema, bone fractures, and hypoglycemia. MSDC-0602K is a second-generation insulin sensitizer designed to reduce these side effects. We hypothesized that insulin sensitization could improve non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In the current study of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, MSDC-0602K did not demonstrate significant effects on liver histology with the biopsy techniques used. However, useful information was gained for the design of future studies and MSDC-0602K significantly decreased fasting glucose, insulin, glycated hemoglobin, and markers of liver injury without dose-limiting side effects.
Herein, we studied the role of cSMARCA5, a circular RNA, in hepatocellular carcinoma. Our in vitro and in vivo data showed that cSMARCA5 inhibits the growth and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, making it a potential therapeutic target.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. More severe forms of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, where hepatic fibrosis occurs, are linked to increased mortality. In this study, we have shown that hepatic steatosis and fibrosis are associated with subclinical myocardial dysfunction. This association is linked to altered myocardial glucose uptake.
Direct-acting antivirals are an effective tool for the treatment of hepatitis C virus, enabling the elimination of the virus. However, some patients who have been successfully treated with direct-acting antivirals are at risk of reinfection. Our findings showed that the risk of reinfection was highest among people with recent injection drug use. Among people who inject drugs, daily use of opioid-agonist therapy was associated with a lower risk of reinfection.
Sorafenib has proven efficacy for the treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. However, overall survival remains poor in these patients, so we were interested to see if the addition of a statin, pravastatin, improved outcomes in patients with advanced HCC. This randomized-controlled trial demonstrated that the sorafenib-pravastatin combination did not improve overall survival in this study population compared to sorafenib alone.
We looked at the importance of two of the main body compartments, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue (fat) on the prognosis of males and females with end-stage liver disease. Lower amounts of subcutaneous fat but not visceral fat (around internal organs), are associated with higher mortality in female patients with end-stage liver disease. However, low skeletal muscle predicts mortality in male patients with end-stage liver disease.
Twelve weeks of the combination of direct-acting antivirals (SOF/VEL/VOX) was safe and effective in patients with relapsed hepatitis C virus infection who had previously received combination therapy with direct-acting antivirals. Treatment response was not diminished by HIV coinfection, or non-completion of previous direct-acting antiviral-based therapy.
Tenofovir is the most potent nucleotide analogue for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection and there has been no hepatitis B virus mutation that confers >10-fold resistance to tenofovir up to 8 years. Herein, we identified, for the first time, a quadruple mutation that conferred 15.3-fold (IC50) and 26.3-fold (IC90) resistance to tenofovir in 2 patients who experienced viral breakthrough during tenofovir treatment.
PAGE-B scores and Toronto HCC risk index were developed to predict the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Caucasian patients with CHB under potent antiviral therapy. This study validated these two scores in Asian patients with CHB and suggested that modified PAGE-B scores could improve the predictive performance. A modified PAGE-B score, which is based only on a patient’s age, gender, baseline platelet counts, and serum albumin levels at treatment initiation, represents a reliable and easily available risk score to predict HCC development during the first five years of antiviral treatment in Asian patients with CHB. With a scoring range from 0 to 21 points, a modified PAGE-B score differentiates the HCC risk. A modified PAGE-B score significantly differentiates the five-year HCC risk: low ≤8 points and high ≥13 points.
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir taken once daily for 12 weeks resulted in high sustained virologic response rates in patients infected with HCV, irrespective of the presence of NS5A resistance-associated variants prior to treatment. Single class NS5A inhibitor resistance, but not sofosbuvir resistance, was detected in the few patients with virologic failure. These data highlight the high barrier to resistance of this regimen for the treatment of chronic HCV across all genotypes in the vast majority of patients.
Significant magnetic resonance imaging findings that differentiated between an intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct (IPNB) with an associated invasive carcinoma and an IPNB with intraepithelial neoplasia were intraductal visible mass, tumor size ≥2.5 cm, multiplicity of the tumor, bile duct wall thickening, and adjacent organ invasion. Significant magnetic resonance imaging findings of invasive IPNB have a negative impact on recurrence-free survival.
Quantification of liver fat by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently used to assess treatment responses in patients with fatty liver, with the assumption that improvements in liver fat translate into less inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis in the liver. However, in this article, we showed that changes in liver fat do not necessarily translate into changes in these parameters. This means that MRI may not be as useful to assess treatment response in patients with fatty liver as previously believed.
There are 2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based approaches available for the non-invasive diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), using either extracellular or hepatobiliary contrast agents. The current results showed that the sensitivity of MRI with hepatobiliary contrast agents was similar to that with extracellular contrast agents, but the specificity was lower. Thus, hepatobiliary contrast agent-based MRI, although detailed in international guidelines, should be used with caution for the non-invasive diagnosis of HCC.
Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressed on antigen-presenting cells, rather than tumor cells, has been reported to play an essential role in checkpoint blockade therapy. A fundamental understanding of mechanisms that regulate the expression of PD-L1 on tumor-infiltrating monocytes/macrophages will undoubtedly lead to the possibility of developing novel PD-L1 blockade strategies with high specificity and efficiency. The current study unveils a novel mechanism by which metabolic switching links immune activation responses to immune tolerance in the tumor milieu, identifying potential targets for future immune-based anti-cancer therapies.
In the context of highly effective and well tolerated therapies for hepatitis C virus that are now recommended for all patients, a reassessment of hepatitis C screening strategies is needed. An effectiveness and cost-effectiveness study of different strategies targeting either the at-risk population, specific ages or all individuals was performed. In France, universal screening is the most effective strategy and is cost-effective when treatment is initiated regardless of fibrosis stage. From an individual and especially from a societal perspective of hepatitis C virus eradication, this strategy should be implemented.
The efficacy of the new direct-acting antivirals is associated with a significant improvement in survival of patients undergoing liver transplantation because of hepatitis C virus-related liver disease. In addition, it has decreased the number of patients with hepatitis C that need a liver transplant.
Delivering hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing to people who inject drugs (PWID) in places where they also have access to HIV prevention and treatment services is an effective way to improve uptake of HCV testing among communities of PWID. To achieve the World Health Organization’s ambitious elimination targets, integrated programs will need to be scaled up to deliver comprehensive HCV services.
High red and processed meat consumption is related to several diseases. In addition, cooking meat at high temperatures for a long duration forms heterocyclic amines, which have harmful health effects. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a significant public health burden and its formation is strongly related to insulin resistance. In this study, both were found to be more frequent in people who consume relatively high quantities of red and processed meat. In addition, a high intake of heterocyclic amines was associated with insulin resistance
Biliary tract cancers include intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC), however there are some differences in their risk factors. Consequently, the distinction between ICC and ECC is important. Over the last few decades, mortality from ICC has tended to rise in several areas of the world, following the increased prevalence of its major risk factors. In contrast, mortality from ECC tended to decrease in most countries, following the increased use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
Liver cancer is a common malignant neoplasm worldwide. The incidence patterns of liver cancer caused by different etiologies varied considerably across the world. In this study, we aim to determine the pattern of liver cancer incidence as well as the temporal trends, thereby facilitating the establishment of more tailored prevention strategies for liver cancer.
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with the progressive dysfunction of lipid metabolism and a consequent inflammatory response. Decreased ARRB1 is observed in patients with NASH and murine NASH models. Re-expression of Arrb1 in the murine NASH model ameliorated liver disease, an effect which was more pronounced in the presence of pro-GDF15 overexpression, highlighting a promising strategy for NASH therapy.
The results of our investigation show for the first time that the Hh signaling in hepatocytes is time-of-day dependent, leading to differences not only in transcript levels but also in the amount of Hh ligands in peripheral blood. Conversely, Hh signaling is able to feed back to the circadian clock.
Recreational inhalation of ketamine is currently an important substance abuse issue worldwide, and can result in anomalies of the biliary system as demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging. Although prolonged exposure may lead to further clinical deterioration, such biliary system anomalies might be reversible after ketamine abstinence.
Sorafenib given orally is the recommended treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), also known as radioembolisation, microscopic, radioactive resin or glass spheres are introduced into the blood vessels that feed the tumours in the liver. This study found that the addition of SIRT with 90yttrium-loaded resin microspheres to sorafenib treatment in people with advanced HCC did not significantly improve overall survival compared with sorafenib treatment alone. However, the results give an indication of how future studies using this combination therapy in people with advanced HCC could be designed.
Most patients with hepatitis C virus have been treated or will be treated with direct-acting antivirals. It is important that we can model the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in these patients, so that we develop the optimum screening strategy that avoids unnecessary screening, while adequately screening those at increased risk. Herein, we have developed and validated models that are available as web-based tools that can be used to guide screening strategies.
We investigated 20,263 nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA)-treated patients with chronic hepatitis B. Patients with NA-induced hepatitis B surface antigen seroclearance on top of complete viral suppression have a lower risk of hepatocellular carcinoma but not hepatic events than those only achieving complete viral suppression under prolonged NA treatment.
We studied the incidence of malignancies in a community cohort of adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in reference to age- and sex-matched adults without NAFLD. After 21 years of longitudinal follow-up, NAFLD was associated with a nearly 2-fold increase in the risk of developing cancers, predominantly of the liver, gastrointestinal tract and uterus. The association with increased cancer risk was stronger in NAFLD than obesity.
Autoimmune hepatitis is an inflammatory disease of the liver, which often progresses to cirrhosis if left untreated or in the case of insufficient treatment response. Current guidelines have defined biochemical remission (normalisation of biochemical markers for liver inflammation) as a major goal in the treatment of AIH. However, data on the prognostic relevance of this definition are scarce. Herein, we demonstrate that the current definition of biochemical remission is a reliable surrogate for low disease activity on histological assessment and for a beneficial long-term disease course. In addition, we establish transient elastography, a non-invasive ultrasound-based method of measuring scarring of liver tissue, as a reliable tool to monitor disease course in AIH.
In most cases hepatitis C virus (HCV) results in chronic infection and persistent viral replication, taking decades until development of overt disease. To achieve such a course, the respective virus must have developed mechanisms to circumvent antiviral response, to modulate the inflammatory response and to utilise the infrastructure of its host with moderate effect on its viability. The present study provides novel data indicating that HCV induces epidermal growth factor production in its host cell, enhancing epidermal growth factor-inducible expression of chemokines that bind to the CXCR2 receptor and recruit neutrophile granulocytes. Importantly, chemokines are critical mediators determining the pattern of immune cells recruited to the site of injury and thereby the local inflammatory and immunological milieu. These data strongly suggest that HCV triggers mechanisms that enable the virus to influence the inflammatory and immunological processes of its host.
