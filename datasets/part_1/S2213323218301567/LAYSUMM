TITLE

Are there mortality risks for patients with epilepsy who use cannabis treatments as monotherapy?

PARAGRAPH

In the USA, Cannabidiol oil (CBD) is in use as an adjunctive treatment for epilepsy in Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndrome patients.

With legalization of medical and recreational marijuana in many states, patients with epilepsy may self-determine therapy with cannabis (SDTC) to treat their seizures.

We present two patients, both died suddenly, both used SDTC in substitution for conventional anti seizure medications.

Many providers may not be aware of SDTC risks, further study of morbidity and mortality of SDTC in patients with epilepsy is needed.
