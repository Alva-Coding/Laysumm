TITLE

Extended pheromone-based short-term traffic forecasting models for vehicular systems

PARAGRAPH

Inspired by the information exchange behavior of ants, we propose three extended pheromone-based prediction models to forecast the occurrence of traffic congestion.

The first model is an algorithmic model while the other two are machine learning-based models.

Compared to the existing pheromone-based models, these developed models allow forecasting ever-changing traffic conditions on vehicular systems composed of both signalized and non-signalized intersections.

Additionally, the proposed models capture the dynamic traffic behaviour by considering all red, yellow and green phases.

Experiments demonstrate the proposed models outperform existing pheromone-based approaches by achieving higher forecasting accuracy.
