ABSTRACT

TITLE

A soft set based VIKOR approach for some decision-making problems under complex neutrosophic environment

PARAGRAPH

Applications in various fields of neutrosophic soft set theory enhance its appreciation to the researchers.

Although, this uncertain solving tool can accomplish several types of real-life problems, but not able to deal with the decision-making problems in which considering an additional information of a corresponding parameter is needed to get a proper decision from a problem.

But, complex neutrosophic soft sets can handle such type of decision-making problems.

Consequently, in this study, we have given concentration on solving soft set based decision-making problems in the field of complex neutrosophic environment.

Firstly, we have introduced some basic set-theoretic operations of complex neutrosophic sets including different types of unions, intersections and aggregations.

Then, a new definition of score function of a complex neutrosophic number has been proposed.

Additionally, the above-defined unions and intersections of complex neutrosophic sets have been stated for complex neutrosophic soft sets.

Finally, by utilizing these proposed notions, we have offered a complex neutrosophic soft VIKOR approach to get a compromise optimal solution for single as well as multiple decision-maker based problems.

Our proposed approach has been clarified by several real life-related problems including medical diagnosis problem, sustainable manufacturing material selection problem, companyâ€™s manager selection problem, etc.

The feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed approach have also been included in the article.
