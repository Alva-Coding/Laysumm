TITLE

An interaction between warfarin and cannabidiol, a case report

PARAGRAPH

Cannabis products are compounds derived from the cannabis plant.

These products are being used with increasing frequency in the treatment of epilepsy and other chronic diseases.

While generally felt to be safe due to their natural origin, data reveals interactions with other pharmaceuticals.

This case outlines one such example in a patient taking warfarin (a commonly used blood thinner).

Following the addition of cannabidiol, the patientâ€™s INR (international normalized ratio, a marker of the blood-thinning effect of warfarin) exceeded the therapeutic range.

This case underscores the importance of proper monitoring in patients taking warfarin and cannabis derivatives.
