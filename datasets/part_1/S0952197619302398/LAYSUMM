TITLE

Semantic versus instance segmentation in microscopic algae detection

PARAGRAPH

Diatoms detection and identification is a essential procedure for water quality assessment.

However, the automatic segmentation of these species is still a challenge in computer vision.

In this work, novel deep learning approaches are applied to predict exactly the image pixels that belong to a certain class.

A comparison between semantic and instance segmentation techniques is carried out to detect and quantify diatoms of 10 different classes.

This is the first time that the use of deep learning approaches is demonstrated for the identification and quantification of diatoms on images with multiple diatom shells and for more than one class.
