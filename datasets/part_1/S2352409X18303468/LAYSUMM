TITLE

Fermented beverage and food storage in 13,000 y-old stone mortars at Raqefet Cave, Israel: Investigating Natufian ritual feasting

PARAGRAPH

The oldest-ever archaeological evidence for brewing barley/wheat beer was recently found in Raqefet Cave (a prehistoric site in Mt. Carmel, Israel).

Our excavations and ensuing contextual, micro-botanical and use-wear analyses of stone mortars found hewn into the floor of the cave indicate that the local Natufian foragers stored plant-foods – including malted wheat or barley – in fiber-made containers that were set in deep stone mortars.

The barley/wheat-based beer likely served in ritual and burial feasts 13,000 years ago.

Such sophisticated use of cereals predates their domestication and indicated their use not only as staples for consumption.
