Network-based direction of movement prediction in financial markets

PARAGRAPH

Financial markets prediction has always been exciting.

Using the historical data of any market to predict its future is not a new scientific topic but with the emergence of machine learning more complex patterns have been found and the quote “data is the new oil” has come to a reality.

In our paper we presented a method to model the global financial markets interaction with networks and predict their future direction.

We showed that using historical data of each market alone is not enough for prediction while the markets interact with each other in a global financial ecosystem.
