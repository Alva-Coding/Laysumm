TITLE

Microwear analysis aiding excavation prioritization at the submerged Mesolithic settlement of Orehoved, Denmark

PARAGRAPH

Deposits rich in Mesolithic settlement debris were located 4-7 m below sea level off Orehoved, Denmark.

Field archaeologists had to determine expeditiously where to focus excavations before the site was destroyed by a major infrastructure project.

Through analysis of wear on dorsal ridges of flint flakes it was demonstrated that much of the assemblage from test pits on higher ground were rounded due to redeposition by waves and currents.

Follow-up excavation in a low-lying area located a layer with numerous artefacts in stone, bone, and plant material that had remained undisturbed since their days of deposition 8000 years ago.
