TITLE

Epilepsy phenotype in patients with Xp22.31 microduplication

PARAGRAPH

The significance of some genetic changes is not yet clear, especially for epilepsy.

We studied a family in which two children have X chromosome alteration (Xp22.31 microduplication) associated with epilepsy.

The boy had benign (rolandic) epilepsy with seizures on awakening and writing/calculating disorders.

The sister had epilepsy with sudden jerks of the limbs (juvenile myoclonic epilepsy).

The mother, carrier of the genetic alteration, and the father did not present epilepsy or other disorders.

These data suggest that this mutation may play a role in the appearance of epilepsy in these patients, probably together with genes specific to epilepsy.
