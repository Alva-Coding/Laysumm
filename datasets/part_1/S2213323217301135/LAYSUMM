PARAGRAPH

Although anti-seizure drugs are often initially evaluated for adjunctive use (in combination with other drugs), monotherapy (single drug) may reduce treatment-related side effects.

Perampanel is approved for adjunctive treatment of focal seizures, with/without secondarily generalized seizures, and primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in epilepsy patients ≥12 years.

Perampanel is approved for use as monotherapy for focal seizures in the U.S.A.

We report data from seven patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who converted to perampanel monotherapy during open-label extension studies.

Perampanel monotherapy was well‑tolerated, and six patients experienced improved seizure control.

Our limited data suggest perampanel monotherapy may be achievable in some patients.
