TITLE

Monte do Carrascal 2 (southern Portugal): Insights into lithic technology and intra-site spatial analysis of a Late Mesolithic hunting camp

PARAGRAPH

Data from the last hunter-gatherer communities is available through the study of the Late Mesolithic site Monte do Carrascal 2, in Portugal.

The archaeological excavation revealed a hunter-gather hunting camp composed of a set of lithics remains associated with two hearths, one of them with auroch remains.

The lithics analysis showed the exploitation of local raw- materials to produce flakes, bladelets and several tools.

The GIS spatial analysis revealed an anthropic origin of the remains location.

The importance of Carrascal is connected to its inland location differing to the contemporary sites riverine location such as Sado and Muge shell middens.
