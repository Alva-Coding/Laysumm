TITLE

Monte do Carrascal 2 (southern Portugal): Insights into lithic technology and intra-site spatial analysis of a Late Mesolithic hunting camp

PARAGRAPH

In this article, the results of the archaeological excavations at the Late Mesolithic site of Monte do Carrascal 2 are presented.

The site, located inland, southeast from the contemporary Sado shell middens, comprised two hearths with faunal remains and a set of lithic materials that were analysed techno-typologically, as well as in terms of their spatial distribution through GIS tools (K Ripley Function, Kernel Density Estimation and Nearest Neighbour analysis).

The study points to a different functionality of this site when compared to most all other Mesolithic sites known in the region, with its uncommon inland location, suggesting that it was possibly a hunting camp.
