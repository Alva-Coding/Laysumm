TITLE

Lead (Pb) isotope signatures for silcrete sources from the Willandra Lakes region, Australia: A pilot study of a new method for provenancing silcrete artefacts

PARAGRAPH

Information about the mobility patterns and exchange networks of past societies can be generated by tracing the origin of the raw materials from which tools were made.

Silcrete was often used to make tools but it has proven difficult to link silcrete artefacts with their locations of origin due to the heterogeneous composition of this rock.

This paper reports the results of a pilot study of the Pb-isotope composition of silcrete outcrops in the Willandra Lakes region, Australia.

Patterned variation in these data demonstrates the potential of this novel technique for linking silcrete artefacts to their locations of origin.
