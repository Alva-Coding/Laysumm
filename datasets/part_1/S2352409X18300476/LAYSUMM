TITLE

The Franklin expedition: What sequential analysis of hair reveals about lead exposure prior to death

PARAGRAPH

Hypotheses on why the 1845 Franklin expedition to the Arctic ended in tragedy include suggestions of lead poisoning.

Lead levels in hair were analysed from a Franklin expedition member, HDS Goodsir.

Lead levels in Goodsir’s blood were approximated to determine lead burden in the three months prior to death.

Lead isotope ratios in Goodsir’s hair were almost identical to that of the bodies discovered on King William and Beechey Islands and were high by today’s standards.

Estimated blood lead levels suggest that lead exposure, whilst high, may not have been sufficient tocause worsening physical and mental symptoms.
