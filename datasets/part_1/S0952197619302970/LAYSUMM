TITLE

Performance analysis of Chaotic Multi-Verse Harris Hawks Optimization: A case study on solving engineering problems

PARAGRAPH

Solving engineering problems is a complex and critical task therefore in this context, many studies have been performed.

This study presents a modified version of Multi-Verse Optimizer is proposed by using the chaos theory and the Harris Hawks Optimization.

The proposed method is evaluated over global optimization problems then applied to solve some of the well-known engineering problems.

The proposed method showed good performance compared the other methods and traditional approach.
