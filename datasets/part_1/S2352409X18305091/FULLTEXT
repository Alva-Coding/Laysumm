TITLE

Pottery from Orduña Village in the 17th–19th centuries: An archaeometrical approach

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Orduña, located in the central-northern extension of the Iberian Peninsula (see Fig. 1) shows a long economic and commercial history that has had in its custom system and in its vicinity to major trade routes the basis of its existence (Salazar and Llano, 2005).

It is located in the bottom of a valley surrounded by mountains reaching 1000 m. Both its strategic location and its topography, have allowed and enhanced its pivotal role connecting the Spanish plateau with the Basque coastline villages (Salazar and Llano, 2005; Angulo, 1995).

Moreover, from the first medieval settlements in the 13th century, several trade agreements have ensured the nature of the village as an important exchange point of goods (Salazar Arechalde, 1995).

PARAGRAPH

The origin of the pottery activity in the village is still unclear.

Nonetheless, it may have played a relevant role in the village's formation, which seems to coincide in time with the process of the craft specialization that in other Basque regions started flourishing by the 9th century (Solaun, 2005).

PARAGRAPH

The reception and trading with pottery in Orduña is documented from the 8th century (Solaun, 2005) until the 17th century (Ruiz-Escribano, 2014).

However, the first solid production evidence is not acquired until the interventions carried out in Zaharra street (N.2–4 and N.24–30) and Tras-Santiago street in Orduña, where a ceramic kiln and numerous sherds dating back to the 17th to 19th century were unearthed (Cajigas Panera et al., 2004).

PARAGRAPH

The pottery activity at regional level would have suffered an important development at the end of the 18th century and all the later 19th century (Escribano-Ruiz, 2013), which in Orduña is specially marked by two important historical facts: the opening of the access road to the Castilian plateau in 1774 (which will result into the deviation of the commercial traffic from Balmaseda towards Orduña); and the immediate construction of a new customs office in 1792, capable of storing and managing the notorious increase of goods that began to pass through the city (Salazar Arechalde, 1995).

Both events promoted new economic conditions in the city and new business opportunities, including the pottery activity.

PARAGRAPH

In spite of the historic role of pottery, which was developed at the pace of the configuration of the village and that is still evident through the toponymy, the ceramologic studies performed until now have only been approached from the technotypologic perspective.

Regarding the documentary sources, the ethnographer Enrike Ibabe reports the local potters' activity during the 17th and 18th centuries (Ortiz, 1995).

PARAGRAPH

In addition, the scarce archaeometrical analyses correspond to chronologies previous to the establishment of the so-called Basque Popular Pottery — a ceramic typology manufactured by Basque potters and very extended in the Basque Society before the industrialization, that consist of reddish earthenware (mostly tableware and household pieces) characterized by partial tin-lead glazes.

For more information see Ortiz (1995).

PARAGRAPH

In the first extensive study of the medieval Basque ceramic record (Solaun, 2005), the reception and potential re-distribution of several ceramic typologies in Orduña is referred, specially after the concession of the privilege of mercado franco to the village in 1228 (i.e. the privilege from the king to establish a market and trade within the city limits).

PARAGRAPH

These typologies include cooking pots, wringers, and diverse forms of pitchers and large jars dated back from the 8th to the 13th century.

More precisely, in the same work (Solaun, 2005) a ceramic typology existing from the 8th to the 10th century and characterized by coarse ceramic of fine walls (denominated Group II) is suggested having its provenance in Orduña, or at least, being compatible with the macroscopic compositional features of the pastes of the clays from Orduña, i.e. pastes with low content of calcite inclusions and a matrix characterized by autigenic quartz and pyroxenes (for more detailed geological information on the area see Ábalos, 2016).

However, no further evidence is provided to support this hypothesis and the possible provenance from other places with outcrops from Triassic periods, such as Maeztu, Murgia, Salinas de Añaña, Salinillas de Buradón or Peñacerrada (all of them in the southern part of the Basque region) is not disregarded (Solaun, 2005).

PARAGRAPH

In a recent study of the ceramic record from Basque region of Alava (Escribano-Ruiz, 2014), in the analysis of the regional and extra-regional production and consumption, no evidence of ceramic products is reported for the case of Orduña corresponding to the period of 14th–17th century, where most of the pottery products received in Alava seem to have been predominantly produced in the workshops of in Bilbao, Salinillas de Buradón, Ollerias or Egileta, which covered a large part of the regional production in the Basque Country (all of them are nearby locations from the Basque region).

In contrast, pottery produced in those sites would have been traded in Orduña (Escribano-Ruiz, 2014).

PARAGRAPH

With regard to the archaeometrical analysis, and to the knowledge of the authors, the only existing ones correspond to 12 sherds unearthed in Orduña and dated back to the 14th century to 16th centuries (Barrachina, 2016).

Therefore, these are out of the target chronological range of the present work.

PARAGRAPH

These archaeometrical analyses performed on a reduced selection suggest a subdivision into two similar groups (PB10b and PB10a) characterized for being highly calcareous (15–20 wt%), low in Fe2O3 (≈3.5 wt%), medium in MgO (1–5 wt%) and distinguishable between them by Ce concentration.

Moreover, these are characterized by a remarkably high Pb content with regard to the rest of the ceramics from the Basque region studied in the corresponding work.

The presence of this element detected in the inclusions is tentatively ascribed to the clay paste used for the manufacture (Barrachina, 2016).

Nevertheless, the potential contribution of the plumbiferous glaze should not be disregarded.

As proposed by Barrachina, these ceramics would have been manufactured in Vitoria and Bilbao respectively.

PARAGRAPH

As mentioned before, the pottery manufacturing system experienced a dramatic modification by the 18th.

In this way, the ceramics that during the 14th–15th centuries had remained affordable only for a reduced sector of the society, became reachable to everyone (Escribano-Ruiz, 2013, 2014).

In the particular case of Orduña, this re-dimension of the pottery market was marked by the implementation of the new customs office and the opening of the access road to the Castilian plateau in 1774.

These changes gradually led to the materialization of the Basque Popular pottery, which would continue as long as there were workshops where pottery was produced manually.

This popular pottery was severely hit by the Spanish Civil war and lasted until the introduction of the industrialization in the second half of the 20th century (Iñañez et al., 2015).

PARAGRAPH

In spite of the significant role of the village of Orduña as trading center, with special focus on its potters, the study of the pottery activity have received a meager attention.

The knowledge about this pottery activity is, unfortunately, scarce for the northern Spain, unlike other parts of the Peninsula (Iñañez et al., 2008).

With this work, we attempt to compensate the unbalanced state of the investigation, specially from archaeometrical point of view, in order to shed light on the potter production centers, technology and trading from Orduña and the rest of the Basque regions and northern Spain.

SECTION

The archaeological intervention in Orduña

PARAGRAPH

on the archaeological excavations carried out between 2001 and 2002 in the town of Orduña, numerous ceramic fragments and the relicts of a ceramic kiln, which can be dated back to late 17th and early 18th century, were discovered.

A continued sequence of archaeological strata from 13th to 20th century was recorded (Cajigas Panera et al., 2004).

PARAGRAPH

The preliminary study of the unearthed ceramics (Cajigas Panera et al., 2004), although it was only approached from the technotypologic perspective (form, decorations, etc.) and was not archaeometrically characterized, was of great interest.

The set of ceramics found in the Tras-Santiago and Zaharra street sites offered a uninterrupted chronological arch from the 13th to the 19th century, which allowed the reconstruction of a remarkable number of ceramic typologies.

In short, the ceramic collection found in Orduña constitutes a reference framework and a paradigm for the study of the materials from other plots of the village as well as other Basque villages.

PARAGRAPH

The ceramic materials studied in the present work arose from three different sites within the city: Zaharra street N.2–4, Zaharra street N.24–30 and Tras-Santiago street.

Note that these are not archaeological sites, but archaeological interventions performed on these three urban areas.

The term “zaharra” means old in the Basque language.

The stratigraphical units (S.U.) from where the ceramics were unearthed correspond mainly to material related to potting activity and was used to fill gaps and level the soil before a building construction.

Thus, many ceramic fragments found in these sites are different examples of kiln furniture (e.g. spurs and firing boxes) and pottery wasters, although there is pottery related to daily-life use as well.

The relationship of the chronologies and the abundance of the ceramic samples from each site, as well as its coating type, can be observed in Fig. 2.

SECTION

Materials and methods

SECTION

Ceramic sample

PARAGRAPH

For the archaeometrical study a sample of 100 ceramics from 17th to 19th chronologies, including different typologies such as bowls, basins, vessels, jars and kiln utensils, were selected (see Fig. 2 and Table 3 for more details).

All of the specimens were provided by the Archaeological Museum of Biscay.

For the selection, priority was given to pieces such as kiln furniture, when available, and others, such tableware based on their abundance and different representative typologies.

Thus, they can be linked to the local production.

SECTION

Experimental

PARAGRAPH

In order to characterize the paste compositions and mineralogical phases, the whole set of ceramics have been analyzed by means of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

In addition, a selection out of these (n = 20) shards has been analyzed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in order to shed light on the understanding of the technology used by the potters.

SECTION

Sample preparation

PARAGRAPH

For the present work, 15 g of each sample was powdered in a planetary mill using tungsten carbide cells for 2–4 min at 300 rpm.

Prior to milling, glazes and outer surfaces were mechanically removed in order to minimize contamination from glaze and soil into the sample.

Powdered specimens were stored in polyethylene vials for transportation to the laboratory.

SECTION

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)

PARAGRAPH

Powdered samples were calcined to 1000 °C.

These samples, along with the Certified Reference Material from the Geological Survey Japan used for the calibration of ICP-MS (JB-3, JA-2, JG-1A, JG-2), were fused using a Fluxy automatic gas fluxer (Corporation Scientifique Claisse, Canada).

This method, previously optimized for similar matrices (Madinabeitia et al., 2008), involves the melting of approximately 250 mg of sample into a Pt-Au crucible together with 500 mg of a flux (LiBO2) at more than 1100° for several minutes.

The mixture is fused using Program #9 of Claisse with steps F4 and F5 extended to last 100 s and 200 s, respectively (ca. 9 min in total).

The melted pearl is then poured into a polypropylene beaker with a solution of nitric acid (HNO3), which is then diluted in several steps at 1:200 using Milli-Q water (1% HNO3).

This solution is then analyzed by a Nexion 300 ICP-MS (Perkin Elmer).

PARAGRAPH

The internal standards solutions (Sc, Y, In, Be, Bi) were prepared from 1000 μg/mL stock solutions of Alfa Aesar (Specpure ©, plasma standard solution, Germany) inside a class 100 clean room.

All solutions were prepared using Milli-Q quality water.

PL 20–200 μL and PL 500–5000 μL micropipettes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) with calibration standards and samples' dilutions were prepared gravimetrically using analytical balance model Mettler-Toledo XS205 (Colombus, OH, USA) with an uncertainty of ±0.00001 g.

PARAGRAPH

The accuracy and reproducibility of the method was checked by repetitive analysis (n = 3) of the JG-1A, JA-2, JB-3 and JG-2 certified reference materials.

In addition, 3 blanks were prepared and analyzed as well for the procedural detection limit calculations following the IUPAC rules, defined as blank signal + 3SD, where SD is the standard deviation of three measurements of a blank (n = 3).

Finally, a signal drift correction was applied on the data, calculated from the drift correction standard (DCS), for which a reference sample was analyzed every 6 samples and following the method discussed elsewhere (Madinabeitia et al., 2008).

SECTION

X-ray diffraction (XRD)

PARAGRAPH

X-ray diffraction analyses were performed with a PANalytical X’pert PRO powder diffractometer equipped with a copper tube (CuKmean = 1.5418 Å, CuK1 = 1.54060 Å, CuK2 = 1.54439 Å), vertical goniometer (Bragg-Brentano geometry), programmable divergence aperture, automatic sample changer, secondary graphite monochromator, and PixCel detector.

The operating conditions for the Cu tube were 40 kV and 40 mA, and the angular range (2θ) was scanned between 5° and 70°.

The treatment of the diffractogram data and the identification of the mineral phases present was carried out with the X’pert HighScore (PANalytical) software package in combination with the Powder Diffraction File (PDF-2) database (International Center for Diffraction Data (ICDD), Pennsylvania, USA).

SECTION

Scanning electron microscopy-electron dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS)

PARAGRAPH

The technological characterization concerning the glazes was performed by means of an EVO 40 (Carl Zeiss) scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipment on thin layers of the samples.

The elemental composition of decorative coatings was determined by an electron dispersive spectrometry (EDS) analysis of areas corresponding to each color, using an X-Max (Oxford Instruments) equipment.

Data were collected at voltage of 20 kV and a current of 50 μA for the acquisition of images and 200 μA for the acquisition of spectra.

The working distance ranged between 8.5 and 18.5 mm.

The EDS spectra were acquired and treated using the INCA software (Oxford Instruments).

PARAGRAPH

For the micro-structural characterization of the pastes, fresh fractures were cut perpendicularly to Z axis of each piece in order to better assess the clayey inner structure, following the methodology used elsewhere (Maniatis and Tite, 1981).

Samples were previously coated by a conductive layer (20 nm of Au) and the detector was switched to secondary electrons (SE) mode.

For a better comparison of the microstructure, SEM images showing different vitrification levels were acquired at a ×2000 magnification.

PARAGRAPH

Some of the glazes (ORD011 and ORD085) were analyzed by another instrument at Rathgen Forschungslabor (Berlin, Germany).

An EDX Quanta 200 from Fei and ESEM that allows working in a low vacuum or environmental mode without the application of a conductive surface coating, in combination with the integrated energy-dispersive XFlash 4010 X-ray analyzer from Bruker.

The working conditions for this instrument were the following: 20 kV, 100 μA, low-vacuum, 11.5 mm WD.

SE mode was used for images and BSE detector for measurements.

The use of two different SEM-EDS instruments did not involve any relevant effect in the results.

SECTION

Statistical treatment

PARAGRAPH

The statistical analysis applied in the current work is based on Aitchison's approach and Buxeda's observations on compositional data (Aitchison et al., 2000; Buxeda i Garrigós and Kilikoglou, 2003; Buxeda i Garrigós, 2008).

Thus, similarity of individuals and subsequently their hypothetical provenance according to the provenance postulate (Weigand et al., 1977) was tested applying algorithms for compositional data written on reproducible R scripts (Calparsoro, 2018).

In order to compensate the differences in absolute magnitude between major (%) and, minor and trace elements (ppm) log-ratio transformations were employed dividing all chemical components by the element that introduces the lowest variability to the entire data set (alr) (Aitchison, 1982).

This transformation was used for the principal component analysis (PCA).

In contrast, for the hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) centered log-ratios (clr) were preferred in order to identify better the clusters when plotting on a dendrogram the squared Euclidean distance using the centroid algorithm (Pawlowsky-Glahn and Egozcue, 2011).

These transformations were chosen (alr and clr) in order to be coherent with other works on the same research line on pottery from the Iberian Peninsula (De Marcos García et al., 2017).

In any case, this choice does not involve significant modification on the final results given the heterogeneity level of the current set of ceramics.

SECTION

Results and discussion

SECTION

Compositional groups

PARAGRAPH

First of all, the compositional heterogeneity was assessed by calculating the compositional variation matrix (MCV), which provides information about the variability introduced by each element into the data set (see Fig. 3).

Ideally, the analytical variance should be minimized in such a way that a majority of the variance is due to the natural sources and not due to experimental errors and/or alterations due to contamination of post-depositional processes.

Therefore, several elements were not regarded for the statistical analysis as discussed in the following lines.

PARAGRAPH

Firstly, Pb and Sn were removed since their high variability that contributes in a 30% to the total variability (see Fig. 3), might be originated in the diffusion from the constituents of the plumbiferous glaze into the clay body and idem for Sn in the opaque glazes.

Furthermore, the error arising from post-depositional contamination was minimized removing P, which is known to be retained by the clay body (Freestone, 1984; Maritan and Mazzoli, 2004; Maritan et al., 2009).

Moreover, due to the possible alteration by analcime, Na, K, and Rb were not considered during the statistical analysis.

This alteration process reports the leaching of K and, sometimes, Rb, from the matrix, with a subsequent enrichment of Na because of analcime crystallization (Schwedt et al., 2006).

PARAGRAPH

For the current data set, the high variability of Ta is explained by two factors.

On the one hand, by the marked dissimilarities between micaceous pastes (11–16 ppm) and all the remaining clay bodies (1–4 ppm).

On the other hand, the implications of the sample extraction method must be taken into account.

In this case, there is a potential contamination by the wolfram carbide cell used to mill the samples.

Co is a known binder in wolfram alloys and usually occurs along with Ta traces, both affecting the values of these elements in the final quantification (Boulanger et al., 2013).

Therefore, Co and Ta were removed from the statistical analysis.

PARAGRAPH

As shown in Fig. 3, CaO and MgO contribute significantly to the overall variability.

Nevertheless, Ca and Mg can be considered elements directly related to the technology and the individual or collective behavioral action from the artisans who manufactured these ceramics (for a further discussion see Buxeda i Garrigós et al., 2008).

Hence, these elements were used with some restrictions.

Nevertheless, the results depicted that MgO played a crucial role when discriminating among certain production recipes within groups, even for some individuals (e.g. ORD007).

Idem for Sr which naturally occurs along with CaO.

PARAGRAPH

Finally, certain metallic elements were not considered, such as Cu, due to the contamination that ceramics can undergo (Buxeda i Garrigós, 1999) and that should be carefully addressed, specially in this case where the variability that introduces to the dataset is not contemptible.

Likewise, Zn and Ni were omitted since they showed values below or very close to the detection limit and the high variability they show is random.

PARAGRAPH

Generally speaking, a large value of the total variation (ντ) indicates greater variability and suggests that the data set is polygenic (i.e. the presence of several compositional groups), whereas a small value for ντ indicates minor variability and suggests a possible monogenic nature of the data set (Buxeda i Garrigós and Kilikoglou, 2003).

In this case (see Fig. 3), the set shows a very high ντ (8.83).

Still, the high ντ (1.32), when the non-meaningful variables are omitted, predicts the polygenic nature of the data set (Buxeda i Garrigós and Kilikoglou, 2003).

PARAGRAPH

In order to extract the groups, a hierarchical clustering analysis was performed (see Fig. 5) by calculating the squared euclidean distance and using the agglomerative centroid algorithm for the sub-composition: Al2O3, Zr, Nb, Cs, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Hf, Th, U, TiO2, V, Cr, MnO, Fe2O3 and SiO2.

The resulting dendrogram allowed identifying three main clusters that match three principal technotypes: micaceous paste bearing (MIC), lead glazed (LG), and tin-lead glazed (TLG).

The most clearly isolated cluster (see Fig. 5), composes one compositional group (ORD-MIC).

The second cluster (LG) contains all honey glazed decorated pieces (ORD-MEL, from Spanish meladas for honey color) and is subdivided into two compositional groups (ORD-MEL-A and ORD-MEL-B).

Furthermore, the third cluster (TLG) is further subdivided into four compositional groups (ORD-A, ORD-B, ORD-C and ORD-D).

PARAGRAPH

All of the identified groups include a fraction of unglazed pieces of kiln furniture such as trivets or pottery wasters (see Fig. 2 for more details), except for the earliest potsherds collection (ORD-B, 1694–1750) and the micaceous ORD-MIC group, whose provenance is tentatively ascribed to Zamora, as is discussed later.

This is the most reliable clue we can employ in order to ensure that the present archaeometrical characterization corresponds unequivocally to the locally produced pottery.

Moreover, the presence of ceramic kilns reaffirms this hypothesis.

This clearly contrasts with the case of the production of the earliest pottery types, of which there is no explicit production evidence.

In this case, we can only suggest that they were locally produced on the basis of their proximity to ceramic kilns and other locally produced ceramics.

This idea is supported by the long-lasting pottery activity of the village reported in the literature (Solaun, 2005; Escribano-Ruiz, 2014).

However, more investigation is required to test this hypothesis.

PARAGRAPH

The high heterogeneity of the whole data set introduced by the ORD-MIC and ORD-MEL groups, force all the TLG groups to cluster together in the statistical outputs, hindering the proper identification of the dissimilarities among the TLG groups.

Therefore, in order to confirm the TLG groups identified through HCA (see Fig. 5), a PCA was performed including only those ones (ORD-A, ORD-B, ORD-C, ORD-D).

In this case, CaO,Sr and MgO were not included in order to avoid the variability introduced due to internal technological choices within each group.

Among TLG groups, the element introducing lowest variability was Er, thus this element was used as a divisor for the additive log-ratio transformation used in the PCA (see Fig. 7).

PARAGRAPH

The diagram of the ternary system SiO2, CaO and Al2O3 presents the situation of the studied sherds (see Fig. 6).

All TLG samples and the kiln furniture bearing the same paste fall within the Wollastonite-Quartz-Anorthite ternary equilibrium system, whereas the LG and MIC potsherds are within the Anorthite-Mullite-Quartz ternary equilibrium system.

As demonstrated by the chemical analyses, the LG and MIC potsherds are very well distinguished from all TLG, differing between them by a higher content of SiO2 for the former and Al2O3 for the latter.

PARAGRAPH

In addition, on the one hand, several fabric types and their estimated equivalent firing temperature (EFT) were identified for each compositional group, according to the mineral phases observed in the diffractograms acquired by XRD (see Fig. 16).

On the other hand, fresh fractures were examined by SEM in order to assess the vitrification level through the observation of the microstructure (see Fig. 12).

Finally, the glaze characterization was performed for the most representative sherds from each compositional group, identifying the coloring agents and technological choices.

In the following lines, the discussion of each compositional group is presented including their compositional highlights, fabric types identified by XRD and glaze characterization by SEM-EDX.

In Table 1 the mean concentrations and SD of each compositional group can be consulted.

Images of the representative ceramics from each group have been included as well as the 3D reconstruction, when available, made out from the sherd as discussed elsewhere (Rodríguez et al., 2017).

SECTION

ORD-A

PARAGRAPH

This group includes 39 potsherds corresponding to the sites of Tras-Santiago (n = 32) and Zaharra 24–30 (n = 7).

Therefore, they are chronologically framed between 1788 and 1850, though two of the sherds allow stepping back to the production of previous periods (1735–1760).

An important percentage of kiln furniture is present in this compositional group, which is characterized by high calcareous pastes (CaO ≈ 20 wt%) coated by tin-lead glazes and decorations with green motifs.

This recipe was used mainly for the creation of tableware forms, such as bowls, plates, and in a lesser extent, jars.

However, some bigger forms (basins) would have also been produced with the same paste (one of them, ORD030 shows only a lead glazed differing in the decoration from all the remaining sherds).

In addition, ORD048 is the only sherd decorated with blue color.

However, its compositional fingerprint is closer to green decorated ORD-A group (see Table 1), rather than ORD-C group that is characterized by blue decorated coatings as is discussed later.

PARAGRAPH

The high value of total variation ντ = 2.7, that is lowered to ντ = 0.45 when removing the non-meaningful variables (see Fig. 4) depicts the monogenic nature of the set, where the lowest varying element is La.

Compared to whole data set of Orduña a generalized lower concentration of trace elements (e.g. Dy, Gd, Ho, Lu, Nb, Nd, Pr, Th, Tm, Yb and Sm) is observed in this group (see Table 1).

The variability of major elements such as CaO, MgO and Sr show a heterogeneity that would suggest internal technological differences within the compositionally compact group.

Dividing them into two groups, according to the lower or higher content in magnesium.

However, this remains between 1.2 ± 0.25 wt% for the whole ORD-A group.

Moreover, it is observed that while the CaO content remains very high for all the sherds, those that are lower in MgO are higher in Sr and vice versa.

This could be related to the dolomitic phases of the clays used.

In addition, the high concentration of P2O5 responds mainly to the contribution of ORD070 and ORD069, which present important alterations by P2O5 (Freestone, 1984; Maritan and Mazzoli, 2004) attending to their striking concentration (22.6 and 22.9 wt% respectively).

Finally, the separated position of the ORD048 with regard to ORD-A group (see Fig. 7), is explained by the particular differences on Al2O3 (11.7 wt% for a mean of 14.2 ± 1.6 wt%) and Th (9.26 ppm for a mean of 12.4 ± 1.4 ppm).

Besides these chemical differences, the concentration of the remaining elements and the HCA suggests clustering them together to form ORD-A group.

PARAGRAPH

This group includes two type of fabrics, F-I and F-II.

Both show main phases of quartz, gehlenite, plaglioclases (albite) and pyroxenes (diopsides).

In F-I the presence of mullite (Al4+2xSi2−2xO10−x (x ≈ 0.4)) is incipient, the diffractogram of ORD020 is shown as representative example of this fabric (see Fig. 16).

The concurrence of these firing phases allows estimating the EFT around 900–1000 °C.

For the second fabric type F-II, ORD003 is shown as representative diffractogram (see Fig. 16).

Being very similar to F-I fabric, the second stands out due to the greater abundance of high temperature secondary phases such as mullite, and the incipient presence of spinels.

This suggests that the EFT of F-II fabric is slightly higher than the previous, ascending to 1050–1100 °C.

The difference of the EFT matches the advanced level of vitrification level observed for the F-II fabric in the fresh fracture of the clayey pastes (see Fig. 12).

The high CaO content that characterizes this group, is coherent with the presence of calcite identified in the diffractograms.

Moreover, it has been observed through SEM images, showing dendritic and very well crystallized patterns (see Supplementary material).

The calcite decomposes after 650 °C.

therefore, it is assumed that all the calcite that is present must have been the results of re-carbonation processes and post-depositional contamination/alteration.

PARAGRAPH

Some of the specimens present slight variations in certain mineralogical phases.

This is the case of ORD022 that embodies even more calcite and a succinct presence of K-feldspars, which indicates a lower firing temperature reached by this individual.

In contrast, in ORD021 no calcite has been identified, while for F-II fabric is quite weighty the presence of this mineral.

The plaglioclase peaks of ORD006 and ORD077 are lower than for expected for F-II, therefore, these last two might have not reached the maximum temperature for F-II fabric.

To sum up, there are two pieces of kiln furniture (ORD024 and ORD031), which seem to have been exposed to slightly higher temperatures (≈1100 °C), regarding their important incrementation of firing phases (specially plaglioclases), and more prominent peak of mullite.

This may be explained by their constant reutilization as kiln furniture, and the high probability of reaching the peak of high temperature at some point of the kiln's life cycle.

PARAGRAPH

Attending to the interaction of the clay body and the glazes, the ceramics were manufactured by a two-firing process technology.

A first firing to obtain the biscuit, reaching the temperatures of 900–1050 °C as seen by XRD analysis (see Fig. 16), and a second firing for the application of the glaze, likely at lower temperatures.

The coatings included SnO2 based white opaque glazes in most cases, and the decorated pieces show predominantly MnO2 based blacks and/or CuO based green colors forming vegetative or geometric motifs applied overglaze (see Fig. 8).

Apart from all the kiln furniture pieces extant in this group, there are some glazed pieces showing firing errors that also enable to link the group to the local production (e.g. ORD061, that shows a damaged glaze due, most probably, to an over-firing process).

SECTION

ORD-B

PARAGRAPH

The group ORD-B is composed by 17 potsherds.

These are all white tin-lead glazed with no decoration.

Typologically, two forms are predominating: plates and small bowls, including also one single jar.

The most relevant feature characterizing this group is its chronological coherence since all the individuals correspond to the equally dated stratigraphical unit (S.U. 80) from the Zaharra 2–4 site.

Therefore, these ceramics represent the earliest sherds (1694–1750) for the studied chronological period (1694–1850) in the village.

PARAGRAPH

The monogenic nature of the set is demonstrated by the total variation, which is of ντ = 0.3 (when not considering the most varying elements (with them ντ = 1.7).

From the MCV it is clear that this variability is related to the presence of the glazes (Pb and Sn), specially Sn with a ντ/τ ⋅i = 0.05.

This ratio indicates the variability of each element (τ ⋅i) with respect to the ντ.

The lower the ratio, the higher will be the variability for the given element (Buxeda i Garrigós and Kilikoglou, 2003).

In addition, particularly two samples are responsible for the increase of the ντ with outlying Cu concentrations, ORD94 (Cu = 149 ppm) and ORD85 (Cu = 37.5 ppm) for a group mean concentration of 71.3 ± 31 ppm.

In contrast, the lowest varying element is Ho with ντ/τ ⋅i = 0.97.

PARAGRAPH

Moreover, some elements in certain sherds are responsible for the significant increase of the total variation, as is the case of ORD083 (showing very low MnO, Hf and Fe2O3 concentrations), and the outlying concentration of Ba is dramatically elevated in this case (723 ppm).

PARAGRAPH

Despite the internal variations mentioned, the study of the PCA (see Fig. 7) shows the clear distinction among the TLG groups and ORD-B.

This group shows the lowest concentration of Fe2O3 compared to remaining TLG groups.

Other major constituents such as Zr (135 ± 11 ppm) and SiO2 (46.7 ± 6.3 wt%) are also found in a lower concentration, which anticipates the possible use of different recipes for the ceramic pastes ascribed to this period.

This hypothesis is reinforced by the general enrichment of trace elements (Dy, Gd, Nb, Nd, Pr, Tm and Sm), whose variability does not depend that closely to the technological choices, but rather to the geological sources, i.e. the clays used for the ceramic pastes (Glascock, 2016).

To sum up, ORD-B shows an enrichment of MgO concentration, ascending to 2.43 ± 0.43 wt%, which is a frequent concentration of pastes rich in dolomitic phases.

To explain this enrichment the deliberate addition of carbonates should be regarded.

However, the lower concentration of CaO (15.5 ± 2.2) with respect to other TLG groups, would rather suggest the presence of Mg-bearing silicates in the sandy fraction of the paste, such as Mg-rich pyroxenes observed by XRD (see Fig. 16).

PARAGRAPH

According to the mineralogical composition, three main fabric types were identified in this compositional group.

ORD095 and ORD097 constitutes F-I.

These ceramics show a very slightly protruding peak of illite at 9 Å.

This, along with the presence of K-feldspars and the incipient formation of pyroxenes (diopside) suggests that the firing temperature of these specimens was around 850–900 °C.

The low sintering level can be observed in the SEM image (Fig. 12).

PARAGRAPH

The diffractogram of ORD084 is shown as representative of F-II, where the main mineral phases are quartz and firing phases.

K-feldspars (mainly microcline) are present too, although in a minor way.

The presence of firing phases of plaglioclases (albite) on the one side, and gehlenite (Ca2Al(AlSi)O7), along with the presence of diopside (Ca(Mg,Al)(Si,Al)2O6 on the other side, both resulting from the silicate and carbonate reactions at high temperatures (Fabbri et al., 2014), indicate high firing-temperatures.

Furthermore, the incipient presence of mullite and total absence of illite peaks, situate the firing temperature at 900–1000 °C.

PARAGRAPH

The F-III fabric is very similar to F-II, but it has more intense peaks for plaglioclases, diopsides and gehlenite, while the peaks for feldspars are less intense.

This, along with the incipient presence of mullite, suggest that the firing temperature was in the range of 950–1000 °C.

The higher sintering level is also evident through the SEM micro-photographs (see Fig. 12).

The presence of goethite (α-Fe3+O(OH)) has also been detected.

This hydrated form of iron oxide, normally decomposes at 300 °C.

Thus, only a postdepositional rehydratation process could justify its presence.

PARAGRAPH

Some sherds differ slightly: ORD091 has a prominent peak of gehlenite, which would indicate that this individual reached a higher temperature, while ORD088 has a high intense peak of calcite, as the peak around 30 Å indicates.

This would be an alteration product since the calcite is transformed after 650 °C (Fabbri et al., 2014)

PARAGRAPH

The ORD-B set does not show any chromatic decoration, being all the pieces plain tin-lead glazed (see Fig. 9).

The SEM-EDS results pointed out to high concentrations of tin dioxide (≈10 wt%) used as an opacifier.

According to the literature, the use of high amounts of SnO2 may be indicative of not having the total control of the glaze opacifying technique.

Potters would use much more tin than needed, while bringing the expensive raw materials to the minimum strictly needed is desired (Iñañez et al., 2008).

Furthermore, glazing resources such as the abundant inclusions of quartz particles and the presence of bubbles are not observed, unlike in the more modern ORD-A group.

To explain the glazing differences, the most probable hypothesis is that the glazing technology evolved from the periods of 1694 to the 1850.

In this way, the use of lower amounts of tin is also in relation with the availability of such needed compound in the market, decreasing during the 18th century due to the war industry needs.

Therefore, technological changes oriented to lower the use of tin in glazing procedures, like the use of quartz and feldspar grains, were gradually implemented by potters.

SECTION

ORD-C

PARAGRAPH

The group ORD-C is formed by 5 individuals.

They are composed by tin-lead glazed ceramics with a common blue decoration.

Among the forms we can find two plates, a bowl, a jar and a home stoup — a singular piece that is served to contain holy water and is used by parishioners in the church.

Chronologically 3 individuals of this group range from 1788 to 1850.

While one of the pieces is older (1735–1735) and the home stoup is dated back to a later period (1790–1820).

As for the chemical composition, a high calcium content characterizes the group (19.2 ± 3.7 wt%).

The ντ of this data set is 0.76, which depicts a compact grouping.

Nevertheless, when removing the Cu from the data set, the ντ still drops to 0.60.

PARAGRAPH

In this data set, like in ORD-B, the Cu is the element introducing the highest variability, after glaze related Pb and Sn.

Followed by, MnO and CaO, which could be related to technological choices.

In contrast, the lowest varying element is U, which is more related to the geochemical fingerprint of the clays used to manufacture.

Therefore, the use of the same clay source is suggested, on which afterward variations could have been applied and, likely, related to slightly chemical variations in the clay outcrops.

PARAGRAPH

While compositionally this group is very close to ORD-A, both results observed by HCA and PCA enable these individuals to comprise a separate compositional group by themselves.

These differences in the pastes are coherent with their different external appearance since all the coatings of this group shows tin-lead glazes with blue motifs.

PARAGRAPH

According to the XRD analysis, the group ORD-C shows two differentiable fabrics.

For F-I, ORD075 is shown as example.

This fabric includes, quartz and firing phases such as pyroxenes (diopside), and plaglioclases (albite).

The fabric shows calcite, which must be secondary calcite attending to the reasons already explained.

Nevertheless, the presence of gehlenite — a sub-product that crystallizes after calcite decomposition at high temperatures (Fabbri et al., 2014) — suggests that calcite mineral was also a primary phase.

The coexistence of these firing and secondary phases allow establishing the firing temperature around over 900 °C.

However, the incomplete decomposition of K-feldspars (microcline), which start taking place at 850 °C indicates that the EFT is not very distant from 900 °C.

PARAGRAPH

In spite of not being very different from F-I, the second fabric type, F-II, underwent higher temperatures firings.

On the one hand, the completely decomposed K-feldspars (since the peak at ≈14 Å has disappeared), and on the other hand, the more intense presence of firing phases such as gehlenite, diopside and specially plaglioclases (albite) and even the incipient presence of spinels (peak at 19 Å), which are common of high firing temperatures, suggests that the EFT is between 950 and 1050 °C.

PARAGRAPH

The characteristic coatings of the group ORD-C show CoO based blue decorations applied over tin-lead glazes (see Fig. 10).

PARAGRAPH

Historically, the blue decorated earthenware introduced new technical procedures, as the CoO based blue pigment requires more concentrated dissolutions, due to its high volatility.

The blue had already been used for decoration in other workshops of the Iberian Peninsula (e.g. Manises) from centuries before (Conesa, 2011).

Nevertheless, the north adopted these technological changes later.

In this way, by the 18th century, the use of blue which only appeared after the green was extended, was still reserved for exclusive consumers.

Moreover, the presence of a firing error that is appreciable de visu in the home-stoup could suggest the non-complete control over the technique (see Fig. 10).

In any case, both the religious character of this piece and the use of a blue pigment whose access was more limited, suggest an exclusive production reserved for finer purposes with ORD-B paste.

From these results, the deliberate election of specific clayey mixtures exclusively for the ceramics decorated with blue motifs could be suggested.

PARAGRAPH

In addition to the blue decorations, Fig. 10 shows a jar made with paste compatible with ORD-B.

The SEM-EDS image shows the glaze of the jar, which does not show a tin-lead glaze, but the concentrated Pb-rich particles predominate in the glaze, along with small quartz inclusions.

SECTION

ORD-D

PARAGRAPH

This small group (n = 4) is formed by unglazed fragments and honey glazed coated ones (see Table 3).

Interestingly, unlike other honey glazed pieces from Orduña, as will be discussed later, these are characterized by a relatively high CaO concentration (9.3 ± 1.9 wt%), given their ceramic typology, in which a lower CaO concentration would be expected.

ORD-D includes wasters as well as kiln furniture pieces, which are all ascribed to 1788–1850.

Moreover, there is a pot (see Fig. 11) of the same chronology (ORD015) that shows very high concentration of Na2O.

Regarding the trade of the cooking pots in the Basque Country, these were likely imported from Zamora from the 14th century onwards and covered the Basque ceramic market by the 18th century (Solaun, 2005).

The reason of this trading relies on the inadequate properties of the Basque clays to fulfill the refractory requirements of firing utensils such a pot.

PARAGRAPH

Zamoran ceramic productions are historically characterized by coarse micaceous clay bodies showing high concentrations of Al2O3 and were taken into high consideration for cooking given their optimal thermal shock resistance properties (Sanchez-garmendia et al., 2018).

In contrast, it is clear that this is not the case of ORD015 that shows decanted fine grained red pastes, which would have been manufactured using the Basque clays, suggesting the local production of the cooking pot.

In addition, ORD018, also show higher CaO concentration (8.56 wt%) than expected regarding its coating (honey glazed), linked a priori, to a low calcareous pastes.

Formally, this fragment corresponds to a bowl, which shows a deformation that took place probably due to the tension exerted o by other pieces inside the kiln.

PARAGRAPH

In summary, this typologically heterogeneous group, includes uncommon pieces, such as high calcareous honey glazed decorated ceramics, a non-micaceous pot and pieces not intended to be sold, such as kiln furniture (trivets) and potter's mistakes.

Taken into account these typologies, we could think about a non-standardised production of pottery or even an experimentation phase.

PARAGRAPH

ORD-D group presents no decorated lead glazing in the pot and the bowl, whereas the kiln furniture is unglazed.

The pot (ORD015) shows black colored external part after the firings that have been exposed to (see Fig. 11).

PARAGRAPH

ORD-D group is compositionally similar to calcareous ORD-A and typologically close to iron rich ORD-MEL groups.

This is in accordance with XRD results, in which F-I and F-II fabric types have been identified (see Table 2).

F-I shows simultaneously the presence of calcite and hematite, ORD018 is shown as example (see Fig. 16).

The minor presence of illite and K-feldspars indicates a low firing temperature, which coexisting with other firing phases, such as gehlenite and albite, should not be higher than 950 °C.

F-II, for which ORD015 is shown as example (see Fig. 16 and Table 2), shows very similar paste, but in this case with an enrichment of plaglioclasic phases and total absence of illite, thus, the EFT could be situated slightly higher than 950 °C.

SECTION

ORD-MEL-A

PARAGRAPH

This group includes 9 samples.

All these individuals are dated back to the same chronology (1788–1850) and, moreover, they were found on the same site: Tras-Santiago.

Their composition is highlighted by being non-calcareous (CaO 1.1 ± 0.39 wt%) and with high concentration of Fe2O3 (4.49 ± 0.61 wt%).

According to literature, the bulk concentration of Fe2O3 is controlled by the abundance of colloidal particles of poorly crystallized iron oxides/hydroxides in the clay minerals, being usually greater in the sedimentary deposits where particles with diameter less than 0.002 mm are on the whole predominant on silt and sand (Montana, 2016).

Therefore, this enrichment of Fe2O3 in the clayey pastes could explain the change of the clay extraction site for the manufacture of locally produced ceramics.

This fact implies a technological choice by the potters in the search of non-calcareous clays that would provide red pastes, which is in contrast to the majolica production that usually utilizes calcareous clays delivering buff color pastes (Molera et al., 1997; Iñañez et al., 2013).

PARAGRAPH

The predominating form for this compositional group is the bowl, though, one jar is also included.

Whereas all of the samples are characterized by a translucent honey glazed external coating, some of the bowls and the jar include tin-lead glazed decoration in their inner part.

A slight enrichment of Hf, Ta, U and CaO can be observed in those pieces, in comparison within the same group ORD-MEL-A Beyond their decoration, they do not have significant differences within the group with regard to their composition.

Therefore, it can be assumed that they were manufactured with the same recipe used for honey glazed bowls such as those used for the other pieces of the group.

Generally, the decorations including tin-lead glaze in the inner part would be, likely, economically more valuable.

Nonetheless, and in addition to aesthetic reasons, the tin-lead glazed was applied in only in the interior in order to save resources, thus minimizing the required amount of opacifier.

Indeed, the outer part is also half glazed.

The sample ORD050 shows minor variations in the elemental composition within the group, this piece is half lead glazed in the outer part, while the inner part is only glazed close to the lip of the piece.

PARAGRAPH

The group ORD-MEL-A (as well as ORD-MEL-B) shows a paste of low sintering state.

This can be observed in the SEM image where the proper morphology and clay structure of a low vitrified paste can be clearly appreciated (ORD012 is shown as example, see Fig. 13).

The fabric F-I is characterized by quartz and Illite-Muscovite phases, which along with the presence of K-feldspars (microcline) suggests a low firing temperature (see Fig. 16 and Table 2).

The three main peaks of the philosilicate phases appear very intense, which indicates that these phases have not start yet to decompose.

Moreover, the coexistence of incipient firing phases such as gehlenite and plaglioclases, suggests that the firing temperature is ca. 850–900°.

Goethite has also been identified, which should be the re-hydrated form of primary iron oxides that characterize these reddish pastes.

PARAGRAPH

The SEM micro-photographies of polished sections show the microscopical differences of the thinner external lead glaze and the thicker internal tin-lead glaze, which includes several inclusions sized less than 100 μm (see Fig. 13).

SECTION

ORD-MEL-B

PARAGRAPH

Within the honey glazed decorated pieces found in the excavations of Orduña, there is another group of 6 individuals denominated ORD-MEL-B.

The chemical differences within this group are very low compared to ORD-MEL-A.

These differences are given by lower CaO content 0.51 ± 0.07 wt% (without taking into account ORD051, which shows a particular enrichment of CaO and MgO), and other slight differences in elements such Mn, Nb, Zn and Zr.

This group shows the highest Al2O3 concentration from all the studied samples Orduña reaching 19.9 ± 2.3 wt%, with the exception of the micaceous bearing pastes (ORD-MIC group).

PARAGRAPH

The chemical homogeneity of these samples is very high (see Fig. 7) and is in accordance with the unique typology representing this group: a basin (the possibility of being the same piece has been discarded since they do not fit all together regarding the perimeter of the basin).

Moreover, chronologically this group is homogeneously dated back to the short period of 1735–1765, which would place the production prior to ORD-MEL-A (1788–1850).

PARAGRAPH

Furthermore, these sherds were all recovered from the site of Zaharra 24–30, differing from the other honey-glazed sherds of ORD-MEL-A which were all found in Tras-Santiago site.

In spite of the high chemical similarities between ORD-MEL-A and ORD-MEL-B, the compact archaeological features of the site and the chronology have been taken into consideration as a strong point when determining these two different reference groups.

The total variation of this group is 1.22, which is slightly high for a monogenic group (Buxeda i Garrigós and Kilikoglou, 2003).

However, when removing Zn and glaze related elements (Pb and Sn) the total variation drops down to 0.61, which is definitely a representative value of a very compact group.

PARAGRAPH

The specimens of ORD-MEL-B group have one single fabric type, which corresponds to F-I.

This fabric is, in fact, very similar to fabric F-I of group ORD-MEL-A.

The representative diffractogram corresponding to ORD078 is shown in Fig. 16.

Accordingly, the mineralogical array shows minor differences with F-I of ORD-MEL-A in some of the peaks intensities, mainly, the phases corresponding to the phylosilicates, specially the peak of illite around 7 Å is higher in this case.

Therefore, the fired temperature for these ceramics may have been slightly lower than the 900 °C established for F-I of ORD-MEL-A.

PARAGRAPH

The paste of ORD-MEL-B was used to create basins (see the 3D reconstructed piece in Fig. 14).

These types of ceramics were manufactured by a single firing applying the lead glaze on the clay body.

SECTION

ORD-MIC

PARAGRAPH

The HCA depicts clearly a subset that is dramatically different from the remaining sherds (see Fig. 5).

These ceramics constituted the group called ORD-MIC (n = 3).

They are de visu recognizable for their heterogeneous pastes showing big sized (<1 mm) inclusions (Fig. 15).

The compositional differences are given mainly by major elements, specially by Al2O3, but also most of the trace elements show important decrease (see Table 1) with regard to the rest of the compositional groups.

The differences of Cs and Ta must be highlighted too.

These pastes are highly micaceous, which is traduced to high Al2O3 concentrations.

As stated in the literature, Al2O3 can be positively correlated with the relative abundance of clay minerals and/or the quantity of monomineralic granules of feldspars and mica in the coarser granulometric fractions (Hunt, 2016).

For such a study, however, in our case, further analysis of the clay samples and their respective comparison should be performed.

PARAGRAPH

For the specific case of micaceous ceramics unearthed in the Basque Country, there is an open archaeological discussion about their provenance.

As mentioned before, good refractory properties (such as those obtained by a micaceous rich clays) are required for the production of kitchen ceramics.

They will show higher resistance to firing-cooling cycles expected during their lifetime.

The inadequateness of the Basque clays for these purposes is manifested from centuries before, when the search for other sources would have initiated (Solaun, 2005).

In fact, the appearance of these productions will modify the market of the local production of pots, specially during the 14th century, initiating a process in which the pottery activity will be gradually discarded by the native potters before a greater demand and quality of foreign productions.

The affirmation of this process has its best expression in the famous “zamoran pots” that by the 18th century already comprise a good part of the market for kitchen ceramics in the Basque Country.

PARAGRAPH

Therefore, according to the literature, the most likely origin of these ceramics, would be in Zamora, a ceramic production site separated by 368 km to the west.

Interestingly, one of the sherds (ORD056), is coated by a tin-lead glaze, and similar pieces have been reported in Durango, which is a coeval Basque pottery production site that is separated by 56km and other Basque Places (Ortiz, 1995).

PARAGRAPH

The XRD results were in accordance with the chemical composition showing a very different geochemical situation.

These pastes show very big sized inclusions (order of mm), which according to the diffractogram (see Fig. 16) correspond to micaceous particles such as chlorite-vermiculite-montmorillonite and biotite, and other phylo-silicates such as nepheline, phlogopite, and enstatite.

The pastes included magnetite as well (see Table 2).

The presence of muscovite and K-feldspars (orthoclase) which are related to low firing temperatures situate the estimated firing temperature around 850 °C.

SECTION

Ungrouped samples

PARAGRAPH

In addition, there were some ungroupable samples (n = 11).

Notwithstanding that according to archaeological and typological features, they were most probably manufactured in Orduña, these samples present random variabilities in their concentrations, not allowing to ascribe them clearly to any of the identified compositional groups.

Priority was given to provide meaningful compositional data for the most firmly characterized groups.

PARAGRAPH

These samples presented outlying values due to several reasons.

ORD014 and ORD019, contain very high MgO concentration (3.42 wt% MgO), but even when omitting this compound they were not associated with any other group.

Although the pastes are similar to ORD-B group fabric F I–V in terms of mineralogical association, it is not possible to provide a solid hypothesis regarding their provenance.

Moreover, ORD047 is a jar with greenish glaze and typologically is very different from all the studied ceramics, according to the glaze coating (opaque greenish glaze with dots).

ORD059, decorated with CoO blue, shows high concentration of Cu, which could be probably related to a post-depositional contamination.

Finally, for ORD055, the unparalleled typology (showing an external lead glaze decoration with a yellowish appearance), along with the differing Mg and V concentrations, did not allow to match any of the identified groups.

Likewise, the concentrations of ORD071, ORD073, ORD074, ORD076, ORD087 and ORD077 did not enable to successfully cluster them.

As can be observed in the dendrogram, these individuals show discriminant chemical differences in comparison to other groups, but also among them, making it impossible their ascription to any group (see Fig. 5).

PARAGRAPH

In addition, ORD096 that showed a very advanced level of deterioration, presented an outlying concentration of SiO2 (12.8 wt%), which is a rather low concentration for a ceramic paste.

Thus, the possibility of an analytical error was not discarded and it was decided to remove it from the statistical analysis.

PARAGRAPH

Similarly, other sherds were not included in the present discussion since they yielded negative values due to experimental errors (ORD052, ORD053, ORD054, ORD063).

In summary, out of the initial 100 sherds, compositional data was obtained for 95 sherds.

Finally, ORD038 was not analyzed, due to its early separation for geometrical documentation, where the whole piece should be kept entire.

In summary, from the analyzed samples, 83 were successfully classified in compositional groups while 11 remained ungrouped.

SECTION

Historical implications

PARAGRAPH

The archaeometrical characterization of the seven compositional groups identified in this work allowed linking the ceramics unearthed in the village of Orduña to a local origin, in connection to the ceramic productions during the 17th and 19th centuries, with exception of the ORD-MIC group, which is associated with Zamora, western of the Iberian Peninsula.

Thus, the production of the late 18th and 19th centuries maintained the tradition of using calcareous pastes that is observed in previous local productions.

However, attending to the compositional differences showed by ORD-B group, a chemical variation that most probably relied on different extraction sites, was observed.

Thereby, this fact might reflect a change from the earliest studied period (1694) to the following century.

PARAGRAPH

In addition, the nature of the compositional groups identified can be linked to the transformation of the pottery production, evolving from non-decorated forms of tableware (ORD-B) to widespread green or green/black decorated pieces (ORD-A), while reserving the blue decorated ones (ORD-C) for more exclusive purposes.

Furthermore, the manufacture of a new ceramic typology is identified: the honey-glazed, whose production is observed after 1788 (ORD-MEL-B).

This latter production exclusively bears non-calcareous pastes together with external translucent lead glazes of brownish color and tin-lead glazed interiors.

The relevancy of the Zamoran imports presented in this study should also be highlighted, clearly discarding their local production in Orduña.

PARAGRAPH

In addition, the integrated interpretation of the multi-analytical approach allowed recognizing several chemical and technological patterns with regard to the pottery manufacturing in Orduña.

On the one hand, the expertise that the potters managed as for the clayey pastes' properties is highlighted.

They would make a deliberate selection of raw materials determined by the finish they wanted to achieve.

For instance, potters chose high or low calcareous clayey pastes depending on the coating they wanted to apply to (e.g. tin-lead glaze, translucent or decorated with blue).

On the other hand, with regard to the glazes, the use of traditional recipes is observed: SnO2 to obtain white opaque glazes, CuO for green, MnO for black and CoO for blue colors.

The ornaments, where present, showed vegetal or geometric motifs acquired by using the mentioned color palette, combining one or two colors at maximum.

These decorations are rather succinct especially in comparison to previous majolica production workshops from the Iberian Peninsula (e.g. Manises, Sevilla).

In fact, the use of polychrome decorations was extensively widespread in previous chronologies (Conesa, 2009).

Therefore, we could suggest that the most elaborated locally produced ceramics during 17th–19th were those decorated in blue (ORD-B).

These pieces were, indeed, reserved for especial purposes, in a society were the technological choices made by the potters tried to adapt to fulfill the requirements of the changing tastes of the consumers.

PARAGRAPH

The historical context of the ceramics studied in this work coincides chronologically with the ethnographic investigations on Basque Pottery performed by Enrike Ibabe Ortiz (1995).

Seemingly, during 18th and 19th centuries, four families would have predominated the local production of Orduña, beginning with the establishment of Lazkano family in the village (1780), continued by Martin and Martinez families, and followed by Ibañez (born in 1841), from whose last step is tracked back in Elosu (Alava), one of the last preindustrial Basque production centers (Maniatis and Tite, 1981).

Nevertheless, according to the historical documentation, it can be argued that the pottery activity in Orduña would have been in the hands of important local oligarchies (such as the Ortes de Velasco), leasing its activity to potters mainly from Alava territory or directly hiring their services (Cajigas Panera et al., 2004).

PARAGRAPH

The radiography performed on the local pottery production from 1694 to 1850 reflects a transforming social change which occurred during the studied period.

In this way, ORD-A group is an example of the ceramics that were eventually extended to most sectors of the population.

This event only took place after a long period in which these ceramics types were only reachable by wealthy customers (Escribano-Ruiz, 2014).

SECTION

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

The archaeometrical characterization performed by ICP-MS, XRD and SEM-EDS techniques, along with the subsequent chemometric treatment, has allowed identifying six compositional groups linked to the local pottery production of Orduña during the 17th and 19th centuries and one exogenous: four tin-lead glazed (ORD-A, ORD-B, ORD-C, ORD-D), two honey glazed (ORD-MEL-A and ORD-MEL-B) and one micaceous (ORD-MIC).

All tin-lead glazed have shown Ca rich pastes (9.31 wt%–19.7 wt% CaO), whereas the other groups have very low concentrations of Ca.

PARAGRAPH

In addition, the compositional variability of the groups throughout the time has revealed the diachronic evolution of the ceramic production.

The sherds from Zaharra 2–4 constitute the earliest compositional group (ORD-B), while the tin-lead glazed groups, ORD-A, ORD-C and honey glazed ORD-MEL-B, whose production started after 1735 were coeval.

In any case, after 1788 the coexistence of all studied groups with exception of the ORD-B has been observed, highlighting two new productions: ORD-D and ORD-MEL-A.

The latter showed for the first time the typology that bears an internal tin-lead glaze and an external lead glaze, during the studied period.

PARAGRAPH

Moreover, the XRD analysis have pointed out that most of the compositional groups include different mineralogical fabrics with different levels of vitrification, allowing us to determine EFT ranges of the whole set from 850° to 1050°.

The different fabric types have not shown any correlation with other factors beyond the technological choices of the potters, owing their main differences to either different EFTs and/or compositional features.

Such is the case for Zamoran ORD-MIC group, whose mineralogical differences are strongly linked to the outstanding chemical dissimilarities in comparison to the remaining groups.

Finally, SEM-EDS analysis have shown the handling of MnO for blacks, CuO for green and CoO to obtain blue colors, applied on white glazes opacified by SnO2.

Whereas, the honey glazed ceramics include translucent glazes of PbO and Fe2O3.

Thus, the use of traditional recipes for glazing has been revealed.
