TITLE

Anterior corpus callosotomy in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy: Invasive EEG findings and seizure outcomes

PARAGRAPH

In patients with severe drug-resistant seizures, corpus callosotomy (CC) is used to surgically disconnect the brain hemispheres to stop seizure spread and decrease seizure frequency.

We researched CC results in adults and children and examined whether intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG), a brain-wave recording from the surface of the brain, could predict the seizure reduction.

We showed that CC improves seizures leading to loss of muscle tone (atonic seizures) and focal seizures with impaired awareness but does not alter outcomes for generalized convulsions or tonic seizures.

We concluded that intracranial EEG prior to CC does not help to predict postsurgical seizure reduction.
