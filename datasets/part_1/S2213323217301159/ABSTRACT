ABSTRACT

TITLE

Anterior corpus callosotomy in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy: Invasive EEG findings and seizure outcomes

PARAGRAPH

Corpus callosotomy (CC) is used in patients with drug-resistant seizures who are not candidates for excisional surgery and failed neurostimulation.

We examined ictal scalp and intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings in 16 patients being evaluated for anterior CC alone or CC in combination with focal resection, to determine the role of the iEEG in predicting postoperative seizure outcomes.

In our cohort, CC improved generalized atonic seizures and focal seizures with impaired awareness but did not alter outcomes for generalized tonicâ€“clonic or tonic seizures.

Invasive EEG prior to CC did not refine the prediction of postsurgical seizure outcomes in patients with inconclusive scalp EEG.
