ABSTRACT

TITLE

Ictogenesis during sEEG evaluation after acute intracranial hemorrhage

PARAGRAPH

We present a unique case of a patient with drug-resistant focal epilepsy undergoing stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) who developed an acute posttraumatic intracranial hemorrhage during monitoring, first detected by changes on sEEG.

Our case demonstrates the evolution of electrographic changes at the time of initial hemorrhage to the development of ictal activity.

We conducted spectral analysis of the sEEG data to illustrate the transition from an interictal to ictal state.

Initially, delta power increased in the region of acute hemorrhage, followed by sustained regional reduction in frequency variability.

Our findings provide further information on the development of epileptiform activity in acute hemorrhage.
