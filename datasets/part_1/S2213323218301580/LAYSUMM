TITLE

Ictogenesis during sEEG evaluation after acute intracranial hemorrhage

PARAGRAPH

Traumatic brain hemorrhage can be associated with lifelong functional, cognitive and emotional impairment.

Management of traumatic brain hemorrhage includes monitoring and treatment of seizure activity.

Studies have shown that new onset epileptiform activity can be present despite absence of any neurological deficits in cases of acute intracranial hemorrhage.

Here we document the electrographic changes in the human brain in response to acute traumatic brain hemorrhage as detected by intracranial sEEG electrodes.
