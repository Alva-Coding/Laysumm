TITLE

Modeling and Analysis of Students’ Performance Trajectories using Diffusion Maps and Kernel Two-Sample Tests

PARAGRAPH

Modeling and analysis of students' performance is a central task in educational data mining.

Nowadays, the gathered datasets have become high-dimensional, hence the quest for appropriate analysis techniques.

In this work, a performance trajectory, which describes the student’s achievements over time, is used as an input unit.

A general framework that utilizes two kernel methods is proposed and demonstrated on two case studies.

Diffusion maps reduce the dimension of the input data and reveal important underlying factors.

Then, statistical analysis is performed via the kernel two-sample test.

Last, the test’s results are interpreted in terms of the identified factors.
