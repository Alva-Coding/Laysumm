TITLE

Material selection and weaving techniques for the oldest basketry in Japan found at the Higashimyou site, Saga Prefecture

PARAGRAPH

The Higashimyou site in Saga, western Japan, yielded over 700 baskets of the initial Jomon period from 8000 to 7300 cal BP.

Large baskets were made mostly with splints of two arboreal species, Sapindus mukorossi and Ficus erecta, and small ones were made mostly with stems of two vine species, Sinomenium acutum and Trachelospermum.

The bodies of the baskets were made by various types of twill, weave, and twining.

The employment of various basketry techniques at this site showed that most of the basketry techniques used in later periods were already established in the initial Jomon period.
