TITLE

Extracting and tracking hot topics of micro-blogs based on improved Latent Dirichlet Allocation

PARAGRAPH

Extracting and tracking hot topics helps us better understand the latest public opinions and pay attention to their evolution.

To extract topics from microblog posts accurately, the five unique features of micro-blogs drive the joint probability distributions of all words and topics, and improve LDA into a novel topic extraction model.

To track the evolution trend of the topic, a hot topic life cycle model is divided to five stages: birth, growth, maturity, decline, and disappearance.

A hot topic tracking algorithm which integrates MF-LDA and HTLCM is developed.
