TITLE

Efficacy of perampanel in a patient with epilepsia partialis continua

PARAGRAPH

Epilepsy is a disease characterized by transient signs and/or symptoms.

It is caused by abnormal discharges in the surface of the brain.

Patients with a subtype of epilepsy called epilepsia partialis continua typically suffer from regular jerking activity on the hands and face; this can last many years.

This condition is very rare and resistant to current treatments.

We examine an elderly woman with epilepsia partialis continua caused by a benign tumor (meningioma).

Her symptoms disappeared after adding a recently-marketed antiepileptic drug named perampanel.
