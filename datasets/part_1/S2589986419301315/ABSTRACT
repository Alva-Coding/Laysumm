ABSTRACT

TITLE

Focal seizures associated with the chapeau de gendarme sign or ictal pouting of insular origin

PARAGRAPH

We report a teenager with childhood onset focal seizures associated with the chapeau de gendarme sign or ictal pouting of anterior insular lobe origin.

The chapeau de gendarme sign has been associated with frontal lobe seizures in patients with focal epilepsy.

However, in this case, stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) localized seizures to the anterior insular cortex prior to her typical clinical manifestations.

Surgical resection of the insular and frontal-lobe network resulted in seizure freedom.

We propose that the anterior insular cortex should be a site of investigation during pre-surgical phase 2 evaluation in patients exhibiting the chapeau de gendarme sign during focal seizures.
