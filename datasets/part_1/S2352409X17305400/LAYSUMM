TITLE

Late Hellenistic and early Roman slumped and cast glass vessels from the House of Orpheus at Paphos, Cyprus. An interim report

PARAGRAPH

From the mid-2nd c. BC glass tableware became an abundant consumer good for the inhabitants of the structures excavated under the House of Orpheus.

This observation correlates with the commercial boom in the late Hellenistic period within the eastern Mediterranean due to the increasingly growing impact of Rome on trade.

The promising results from the combined archaeological, optical and chemical analyses demonstrates the great potential of a large-scale research project defining the different glass groups and different glass recipes in relation to specific vessel types of the Hellenistic and early Roman period, which can eventually be linked to specific glass workshops.
