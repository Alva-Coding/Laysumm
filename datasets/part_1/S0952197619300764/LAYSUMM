TITLE

Magnetic Resonance Imaging, texture analysis and regression techniques to non-destructively predict the quality characteristics of meat pieces

PARAGRAPH

The quality of meat products (pig hams and loins) is traditionally assessed by chemical or sensorial analysis, which are time consuming, need specialized technicians and destroy the products.

We use Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), computer vision (texture features) and machine learning (regression models) to predict 39 meat attributes.

For most of them, the performance is good or excellent with a weighted absolute error below 2% and without statistically significant differences between predicted and true values.

This automatic system could reliably predict the quality of meat pieces operating on-line in the meat industries in the future.
