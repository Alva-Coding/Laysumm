TITLE

Therapy-driven Deep Glucose Forecasting

PARAGRAPH

Predicting the glucose level in Type 1 diabetes patients is a critical but also challenging task.

We propose Deep Glucose Forecasting, a deep learning architecture based on recurrent neural networks which is able to predict the glucose level of a patient.

We define an architecture composed by two models: one observing past measurements (injections, carbohydrate intake and glucose) and the second one exploiting future inputs over a fixed prediction horizon.

The model, trained on 100 patients of the UVA/Padova simulator, outperforms classical population models generalizes to unseen real patients and reaches personalized models performance on a real patient via fine-tuning.
