TITLE

Multiobjective great deluge algorithm with two-stage archive support

PARAGRAPH

Premature convergence of metaheuristics is due to loss of promising search directions due to misguidance of highly dominant but locally optimal solutions extracted at early iterations.

The method presented in this article employs a two-stage external memory of promising solutions such that the first stage acts as a short-term memory that is updated frequently as new promising solutions are extracted whereas the second stage acts as a long-term memory and provides alternative search directions experienced over a number of generations.

The proposed method is implemented within the great Deluge algorithmâ€™s framework and used for the solution numerical multiobjective optimization problems.
