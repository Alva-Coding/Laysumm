Seizures associated to influenza infection are rare in adults without encephalitis.

We present here 3 healthy adult patients with seizures related to influenza A or B infection without evidence encephalitis, encephalopathy or any other cause for seizures.

Seizures can occur in healthy adults with influenza infection without evidence of encephalitis, a possibility to be borne in mind to avoid potentially harmful therapeutic and diagnostic procedures.
