TITLE

Influenza-associated seizures in healthy adults: Report of 3 cases

PARAGRAPH

Influenza is a common, worldwide acute infectious respiratory disease that only occasionally complicates with neurological disturbances, including brain infection (encephalitis), diffuse brain dysfunction (encephalopathy), followed by seizures or epileptic status (repeated seizures).

They occur more frequently in children during influenza infection and less common after vaccination.

We describe in this case report three healthy patients who suffered from seizures in the context of influenza A or B infection and who did not have evidence of encephalitis.

This is an uncommon situation, particularly in healthy adults, but should be considered to avoid potentially harmful therapeutic and diagnostic procedures.
