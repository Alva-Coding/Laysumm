TITLE

fierClass: A multi-signal, cepstrum-based, time series classifier

PARAGRAPH

Multivariate time series classification is an artificial intelligence task that predicts the behavior of the data generation mechanism through the analysis of a set of measured signals.

In this context, this paper proposes an efficient algorithm based on the analysis of frequency-based information through cepstrum, a mathematical tool used also in other signal processing applications.

Notably, the paper proves the effectiveness of the method in deriving the final classification from multiple input signals that are optimally combined.

The method is applied to the challenging task of determining whether a human is manipulating a smartphone while driving.
