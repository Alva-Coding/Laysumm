TITLE

Fault prognostics by an ensemble of Echo State Networks in presence of event based measurements

PARAGRAPH

Traditional data-driven fault prognostic approaches face the challenge of dealing with incomplete and noisy data collected at irregular time steps, e.g. in correspondence of the occurrence of triggering events at the system level.

Two strategies based on the use of ensembles of Echo State Networks (ESNs), properly adapted to deal with data collected at irregular time steps, are proposed to this aim.

A synthetic and a real-world case study are used to show their effectiveness and their superior performance with respect to state-of-the-art prognostic methods.
