TITLE

Sources of the ochres associated with the Lower Magdalenian “Red Lady” human burial and rock art in El Mirón Cave (Cantabria, Spain)

PARAGRAPH

This article presents the second study of ochres associated with the Lower Magdalenian “Red Lady” human burial (18,700 years old) in El Mirón Cave (Cantabria, Spain).

By means of instrumental techniques, the origin of the specially prepared idiomorphic hematite in the burial layer and painted on a large, engraved block adjacent to it was shown to be an outcrop 27 km from the site on the Atlantic coast (Santoña).

Similar analyses show that the ochre used to stain the nearby cave wall adjacent to an engraved horse image is different in composition, as are other ochres in the Magdalenian occupations.
