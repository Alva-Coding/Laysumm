TITLE

The evolution of obsidian procurement in ancient Oaxaca, Mexico: New data from the Sistema 7 Venado architectural complex, Monte Albán

PARAGRAPH

Recent archaeological investigations (2009-2016) in Sistema 7 Venado, a ceremonial group located on the south part of Monte Albán, Oaxaca, Mexico, demonstrates that occupation and ceremonial activity on the site can be traced back until 800 BCE.

Around 200-300 CE, the complex is ritually abandoned, but, during about a thousand years of occupation, pre-Hispanic people have used hundreds chipped tools and weapons from different varieties of obsidian.

To discover the obsidian sources used at 7 Venado, 416 of these artefacts were analysed by PIXE technique.

The results led us to twelve Mexican sources and revealed variations of supply areas through time.
