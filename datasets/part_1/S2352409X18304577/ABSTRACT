TITLE

The evolution of obsidian procurement in ancient Oaxaca, Mexico: New data from the Sistema 7 Venado architectural complex, Monte Albán

PARAGRAPH

Recent archaeological investigations (2009–2016) in the Sistema 7 Venado, a ceremonial complex located on the south part of the Monte Albán hill, Oaxaca, Mexico, demonstrates that occupation and ceremonial activity on the site can be traced back until 800 BCE.

Around 200–300 CE, this site was ritually abandoned and its structures covered by a thick layer of soil.

This process indirectly offered a good protection of architectural structures and occupation levels.

The chemical composition of 416 obsidian artefacts discovered during the excavations campaigns were analysed by PIXE technique to determine their origin and to replace the Sistema 7 Venado development into the complex trade network of the central valleys of Oaxaca.

The results led us to twelve obsidian sources, Otumba, Pacheco, Zacualtipán/Metzquititlán, Sierra de Pachuca, Malpaís, Paredón, Zaragoza, Guadalupe Victoria, Pico de Orizaba, Altotonga, Ucareo and Magdalena, and also revealed variations in the areas of supplies through time.
