ABSTRACT

TITLE

Efficacy and tolerability of MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL in a pediatric RASMUSSEN syndrome

PARAGRAPH

Rasmussen syndrome (RS) is a chronic encephalopathy with uncertain etiology and immune-mediated pathogenesis.

The only definitive treatment is represented by functional hemispherectomy.

We describe the case of a 6.5-year-old female patient who developed several episodes of focal, unilateral clonic seizure.

Following laboratory and instrumental investigations, the patient was diagnosed with RS.

A treatment with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin and the antiseizure therapy (carbamazepine and levitiracetam) did not completely control the seizures.

Therefore, the patient was treated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), showing a good clinical response, with reduction of the seizure episodes, and stability of the radiological findings.

This case suggests the potential utility of MMF in the immune approach to RS.
