TITLE

Efficacy and tolerability of MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL in a pediatric RASMUSSEN syndrome

SECTION

Background

PARAGRAPH

Rasmussen syndrome (RS) is a chronic, progressive encephalopathy with unihemispheric involvement.

It is characterized by intractable focal seizures, epilepsia partialis continua, hemiparesis, and progressive cognitive decline [1].

The etiology of the disease remains unknown, and the mechanisms underlying the immune-mediated pathogenesis of RS have been extensively investigated in order to improve therapeutic strategies and provide targeted therapy.

The current recommended treatment for RS is functional hemispherectomy.

In this paper, we describe the first case of a pediatric patient diagnosed with RS who has been successfully treated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).

SECTION

Case report

PARAGRAPH

A 6.5-year-old South American girl with unremarkable history experienced her first nonprolonged, focal, unilateral clonic seizure associated with head and eye deviation to the left, during fever.

A month later, she starting experiencing daily seizures characterized by behavioral arrest, head and eye deviation to the left, and left hand twitching.

Neurological examination showed left hemiparesis and pyramidal signs (grade 2 at the modified Rankin scale (mRS) for children).

The patient did also showed mild speech impairment.

PARAGRAPH

Her EEG (Fig. 1A) revealed slowed activity in the right hemisphere and interictal spike and wave discharges in roght fronto-temporal regions.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed right frontal and temporal cortical atrophy with T2 hyperintensity (Fig. 2A, 2B).

PET (Fig. 2C) scan confirmed reduced FDG uptake in the right hemisphere.

PARAGRAPH

Infectious and rheumatologic blood tests were performed on CSF/serum, including negative antiNMDA, antiVGK/LGI1, GABA B receptor, gangliosides, onconeuronal, antinucleous, cytoplasmic and peripheral antineutrophil, and antiphospholipid antibodies.

Search for TORCH complex, Parvovirus B19, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Entero-Rhino virus, Adenovirus, Polyomavirus JC and BK, and Tuscany virus, was negative.

Serum IgM tested positive for the EBV virus (268,5 KU/L, normal value < 10 KU/L) with perceptible DNA of EBV in blood (> 500 copies/ml).

Additionally, the IgG tested positive for the Zika virus (qualitative assay).

PARAGRAPH

According to current diagnostic criteria, even in absence of defined epilepsia partialis continua, the clinical picture and the unilaterality of brain involvement allow for the diagnosis of RE [1].

PARAGRAPH

The girl started antiseizure therapy with carbamazepine (up to 20 mg/kg/day) and then levetiracetam as add-on (up to 50 mg/kg) with no effect.

The patient received two cycles of systemic corticosteroid therapy associated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

Each cycle of IVIG was composed by 2 infusions of IVIG at the dosage of 1 g/Kg.

This resulted in a mild improvement of neurological deficits.

PARAGRAPH

However, due to the persistence of the seizure, after six months from disease onset, oral MMF up to 1000 mg/m2 was started, concomitantly to the tapering of corticosteroid.

The patient showed a dramatic response, with reduction of seizures, improved functional improvement (grade 1 according to mRS).

After 1 year of treatment, a reduction of the EEG slowing in the right hemisphere was evident (Fig. 1B); brain MRI showed stable inflammatory changes (Fig. 1 D).

The cognitive assessment performed one year after disease onset showed absence of progression of the cognitive decline.

The child was seizure-free for 10 months, and continued on MMF (750 mg/m2), carbamazepine (dose), and levetiracetam.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The described case offers interesting elements about the etiology, pathogenesis and treatment of RS.

The etiology of the disease is unknown, and several potential infectious causes have been investigated, without demonstrating a clear correlation between RS and specific agents.

To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric case of RS concomitant to an acute EBV infection.

Although this result has to be interpreted with caution, we suggest that the virus could have represented a trigger for the disease.

The virus has been evidenced in the encephalic tissue of pediatric patients, confirming its potential pathogenic role [2,3].

In our case, the identification of EBV in the brain tissue was not possible, as the clinical and radiological features allowed the diagnosis of RS without the necessity of a brain biopsy.

Moreover, the patients exhibited positive serology for previous Zika infection.

This association has never been described, and therefore further studies are needed to clarify the existence of a role of Zika in RS.

PARAGRAPH

The therapeutic approach to treating RS by means of agents that interfere with the immune system has been performed with different agents.

These include intravenous immunoglobulins, corticosteroids, azathioprine, and tacrolimus [4â€“10].

The purpose of agents active on the immune system in RS is to arrest or slow down the progression of brain atrophy.

It does not represent a definitive treatment.

PARAGRAPH

Therefore, most patients ultimately must undergo a functional hemispherectomy.

The immune mechanism underlying the disease, as evidenced by hystopathological findings and cytokine expression profiles, confirm that the T-cells (CD8 cells in particular) are crucial in the development of brain damage [11].

This supports the utility of T-targeted therapies.

PARAGRAPH

MMF acts by inhibiting purine synthesis in lymphocytes, inducing apoptosis in activated T cells and reducing the recruitment of lymphocytes, and it has been successfully used to treat other types of immune-mediated encephalitis.

Additionally, MMF is generally better tolerated than azathioprine [12].

PARAGRAPH

Based on this rationale, we treated our patient (who showed incomplete disease control with antiepileptic therapy and corticosteroids) with MMF while acquiring clinical and electroencephalographic data.

Moreover, the follow-up MRI showed an absence of progression of the cortical atrophy.

To date, there have been no other reports of patients with RS having successfully been treated with MMF, except for one published case of clinical response achieved with the combination of MMF and steroids [13].

PARAGRAPH

Interestingly, in our case MMF carried out its action both as a corticosteroid-sparing agent in the acute phase, and as a drug on its own with respect to the control of the disease's progression.

PARAGRAPH

Albeit surgery remains the only definitive treatment for patients with RS, it implies the development of hemianopia and hemiplegia.

Therefore, the search for effective drugs active on the immune system is crucial in the management of RS.

Despite the small size and the relatively short follow-up period, this case suggests that MMF, for its efficacy and safety, could represent an effective opportunity for the immune approach in patients suffering from RS.
