TITLE

Efficacy and tolerability of MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL in a pediatric RASMUSSEN syndrome

PARAGRAPH

Rasmussen syndrome (RS) is a chronic progressive encephalopathy with unihemispheric involvement, clinically featured by intractable focal seizures, epilepsia partialis continua, hemiparesis, and cognitive decline.

Despite immune-mediated pathogenesis, the only definitive treatment for RS is represented by functional hemispherectomy.

We describe the case of a 6.5-year-old female patient diagnosed with RS, who was firstly treated with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin and antiseizure therapy, showing an incomplete response.

Finally, the patient received therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), obtaining a good clinical response, demonstrated by the reduction of the seizure episodes, and the stability of the radiological findings.
