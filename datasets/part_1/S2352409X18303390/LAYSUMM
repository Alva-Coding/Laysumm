TITLE

A Late Holocene palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of Ulong Island, Palau, from starch grain, charcoal, and geochemistry analyses

PARAGRAPH

This paper presents, for the first time, the results of starch grain and geochemistry analyses conducted on a sediment core from Ulong Island, Palau.

Along with charcoal and radiocarbon analyses, the results provide a history of human arrival and activity at Ulong and reveal three phases of land use.

Phase 1, from 3000-2000 BP, represents an initial phase of clearance and gardening associated with temporary/intermittent use of the island.

Phase 2 is a period of reduced and stabilized gardening associated with more permanent habitation from 2000-1000 BP.

Finally, Phase 3 represents the period of island abandonment, after 1000 BP, up to the arrival of Europeans in 1783.
