ABSTRACT

TITLE

Combining dynamic finite state machines and text-based similarities to represent human behavior

PARAGRAPH

The analysis of human behavior is a popular topic of research since it allows obtaining specific information about individuals, their motivations, and the problems and difficulties they can encounter.

Human behavior can be grouped to elaborate profiles that would enable the classification of individuals.

Nevertheless, the elaboration of profiles related to human behaviors presents some difficulties associated with the volume of data and the number of parameters typically considered.

Thus, the development of software able to automatize the manipulation of data through graphical assistants to produce understandable visualizations of the human behaviors is crucial.

In this paper, the VISUVER framework is presented.

It uses finite state machines to represent and visualize the dynamic human behavior automatically.

This behavior could be provided by real data collected by specific sensors or simulated data.

The state machines are built in sequential steps in order to illustrate the dynamic evolution of the behavior over time.

VISUVER also includes similarity metrics based on text mining techniques to establish possible profiles among the analyzed behaviors.

The Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) domain has been considered in order to validate the proposal.
