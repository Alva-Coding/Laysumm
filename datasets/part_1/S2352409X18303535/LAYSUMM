TITLE

Mobility and trade in Mediterranean antiquity: Evidence for an ‘Italian connection’ in Mycenaean Greece revealed by ancient DNA of livestock

PARAGRAPH

This article aims to shed light on trade connections and mobility in the Aegean during the Mycenaean palatial and postpalatial periods (1400-1050 CE) through ancient DNA of livestock.

We sequenced pig and cattle mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from Tiryns, Greece and discovered an Italian pig haplotype during the palatial period, which is the first time that this haplotype is found outside Italy.

We were unable to trace diachronic changes in the composition of cattle livestock, because only the palatial period samples yielded ancient DNA.

The results of this study corroborate that pigs were translocated through various patterns of Mediterranean mobility.
