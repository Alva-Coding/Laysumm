TITLE

Multi-agent architecture for information retrieval and intelligent monitoring by UAVs in known environments affected by catastrophes

PARAGRAPH

The consequences of natural or man-made catastrophes can be devastating.

To minimize its impact, it is crucial to carry out a rapid analysis of the affected environment after they occur, without putting human lives at risk.

This research work discusses an architecture that allows the deployment of teams of drones that are intelligently controlled by software agents.

These agents are able to analyze what happens in the environment, detecting dangerous situations and supporting the security personnel.

A case study is presented in which the spread of toxic smoke in an industrial complex which has suffered an earthquake is monitored.
