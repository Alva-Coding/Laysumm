TITLE

A new hierarchical approach to requirement analysis of problems in automated planning

PARAGRAPH

Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence - AI are being revised and improved but much attention is dedicated to machine learning, while the other side of machine intelligence suitable to control and automation is not well explored.

Intelligent Planning is a key issue in machine intelligence but needs to have its design process enhanced and revised.

This paper revisits the design of planning solutions with a knowledge engineering approach.

Such an approach can open the possibility to apply AI Planning in more complex engineering problems.
