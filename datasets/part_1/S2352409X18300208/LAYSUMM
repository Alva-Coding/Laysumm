TITLE

Revisiting the date of the Java Sea Shipwreck from Indonesia

PARAGRAPH

Forty-one ceramic boxes from the twelfth/thirteenth-century Java Sea Shipwreck were analyzed at Chicagoâ€™s Field Museum using elemental analysis (portable x-ray fluorescence, PXRF).

Twenty-two samples are bluish-white qingbai-type wares and nineteen have painted black decorations originally covered by a bright green glaze.

The main goals were to test whether visually similar ceramics shared similar elemental compositions and to identify ceramics from different production sites (kilns).

Based on this study, although PXRF can be successfully used to some degree to differentiate between different groups of qingbai-type ceramics, more research needs to be done on its applicability to painted ware pieces.
