TITLE

Epilepsy in Christianson syndrome: Two cases of Lennoxâ€“Gastaut syndrome and a review of literature

PARAGRAPH

Christianson syndrome (CS) is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the brain during infancy.

Clinical features include intellectual disability, limited speech, difficulties with coordination and with walking in addition to seizures that may become drug-resistant.

We describe two patients with CS who developed Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

Our two cases highlight the features of seizures and EEG findings in CS in children with drug-resistant epilepsy.
