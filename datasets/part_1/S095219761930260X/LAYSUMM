TITLE

Non-convex hull based anomaly detection in CPPS

PARAGRAPH

Just as normal objects, data also may have shapes.

Think about a flock of birds where each bird is placed at a specific position in the sky but the flock as a whole may have a distinct shape.

And analogously, individual data points also have a position (in an abstract mathematical space) and form different shapes as a whole.

Data from production plants have very complex shapes and in this paper a new method has been developed which identifies these shapes.

Once this shapes have been computed, it is easy to identify not-normal data points, i.e. error situations.
