TITLE

Through diachronic discontinuities and regionalization: The contribution of the analysis of the lithic industries from Grotta della Serratura (Strata 10-9) in the definition of Epigravettian in the southern Italian peninsula

PARAGRAPH

Within the evolutionary dynamics of post-Gravettian techno-complexes, one can observe an intense regionalization phenomenon.

To date, typological studies have led to the recognition of several Italian Epigravettian facies in the lithic complexes.

With this work we want to add information related to technological pattern which contributes to the debate on the latest Pleistocene complexes to southern Italy.

The Grotta della Serratura represents an excellent reference site for the Southern Italy.

Thus it begins to bring new technological data that can make important contributions to the discussion of the lithic complexes in the Mediterranean area from the late Upper Paleolithic.
