ABSTRACT

TITLE

Through diachronic discontinuities and regionalization: The contribution of the analysis of the lithic industries from Grotta della Serratura (Strata 10-9) in the definition of Epigravettian in the southern Italian peninsula

PARAGRAPH

Within the evolutionary dynamics of post-Gravettian techno-complexes, one can observe an intense regionalization phenomenon, both on a European scale, with the creation of two main provinces, and within the Italian peninsula.

To date, typological studies have led to the recognition of several Italian Epigravettian facies, identifying trends, similarities, and differences in the lithic complexes.

An important contribution was made by the technological method which in recent years has allowed us to identify the evolutionary processes of the lithic industries in numerous deposits of northern Italy.

It is the intent of this reporting to add information which contributes to the debate on the latest Pleistocene complexes, expanding the area to southern Italy.

The Grotta della Serratura, by virtue of a large and well-detailed stratigraphy, the optimum state of conservation of the findings, and for previous interdisciplinary studies that have been undertaken, represents an excellent reference site for the lower Tyrrhenian Italian coast.

Thus it begins to bring new technological data to already known collections in an area rich in archaeological evidence that can make important contributions to the discussion of the lithic complexes in the Mediterranean area from the late Upper Paleolithic.
