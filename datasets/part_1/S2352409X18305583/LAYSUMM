TITLE

A comparison of biodegradation caused by Teredinidae (Mollusca:Bivalvia), Limnoriidae (Crustacea:Isopoda), and C. terebans (Crustacea:Amphipoda) across 4 shipwreck sites in the English Channel

PARAGRAPH

Marine wood borers live in large aggregations with the ability to reproduce and grow rapidly, causing extensive damage to wooden underwater cultural heritage (UCH).

Hence, the need to protect UCH is paramount, and understanding environmental conditions and species abundance is essential to identifying high risk sites.

The study assessed the rate of degradation on UCH sites in different marine environments by deploying wooden test panels.

Upon recovery, test panels were photographed, X-rayed and degradation was recorded with CAD software.

Results indicated sediment type and coverage was a key factor controlling abundance of marine wood borers and the rate of biodegradation.
