ABSTRACT

TITLE

Perampanel: A therapeutic alternative in refractory status epilepticus associated with MELAS syndrome

PARAGRAPH

To our knowledge, there are no reports of status epilepticus (SE) associated with mitochondrial diseases and treated with perampanel (PER).

We present three cases of patients with refractory SE associated with MELAS syndrome who responded favorably to PER.

PARAGRAPH

All cases were diagnosed as non-convulsive SE (focal without impairment of level of consciousness).

After an initial treatment with other anti-seizure drugs, PER was added in all cases (8, 16 and 12 mg) and cessation of SE was observed within the next 4-8 hours.

All the cases involved a stroke-like lesion present on brain MRI.

PARAGRAPH

In our patients, PER was an effective option in SE associated with MELAS syndrome.
