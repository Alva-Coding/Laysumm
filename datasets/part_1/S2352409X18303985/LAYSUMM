Histological age assessment in a prehispanic Maya sample from Xcambó, Yucatan, Mexico: Benefits and limitations

PARAGRAPH

This study evaluates and compares several microscopic age estimation formulae and standard macroscopic age estimates for a population of prehispanic Maya at Xcambó, Mexico.

Differences between estimates provide interesting insights into the applicability of histological age assessment in archaeological material.

Results support the use of regionally adjusted formulae for age estimation, but also encourage future exploration regarding microstructural variation in population samples linked to lifestyle and other regional factors.
