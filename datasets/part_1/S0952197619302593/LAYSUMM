TITLE

Manta ray foraging optimization: An effective bio-inspired optimizer for engineering applications

PARAGRAPH

This paper presents a new bio-inspired optimization algorithm, named Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (MRFO), based on intelligent behaviors of manta rays.

MRFO is a swarm-based technique that simulates three unique foraging strategies of manta rays, including chain foraging, cyclone foraging, and somersault foraging.

The performance of MRFO is assessed with thirty-one benchmark optimization functions and eight engineering design problems.

The experimental results reveal that the proposed method is far superior to other state-of-the-art optimizers, especially for the real-world engineering applications, MRFO is more competitive in terms of computational expense and solution precision.
