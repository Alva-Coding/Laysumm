TITLE

Valproic acid as a monotherapy in drug-resistant methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) duplication-related epilepsy

PARAGRAPH

We present the case of a rare genetic form of epilepsy (MECP2 duplication syndrome) that is usually unresponsive to drug therapy.

In our case, we show how valproic acid can help control seizures in some children with this rare genetic condition.

The benefits of using valproic acid include its effectiveness as a single drug therapy, its ability to target multiple brain mechanisms, and the possibility of combining it with other drugs for an enhanced effect.

There are side effects of valproic acid, but these can be addressed by reducing the drug dose and closely monitoring the patientâ€™s bloodwork.
