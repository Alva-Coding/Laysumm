TITLE

Communities of weavers: A methodology for analyzing textile and cloth production

PARAGRAPH

In this paper, we develop a methodology for identifying groups of textiles that feature consistent associations among techniques used in distinct production phases.

We employ this methodology to analyze 141 textiles recovered from a single grave in the middle Chincha Valley, Peru that dates from the Late Horizon (AD 1400 – 1532) to the Colonial Period (AD 1532 – 1825).

Six groupings of textile production techniques were identified, each of which may have corresponded to a distinct community of weavers associated with this grave.

We argue that this methodology can provide insights into communities of weavers within and outside the Andes.
