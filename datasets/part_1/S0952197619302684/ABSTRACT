ABSTRACT

TITLE

Interval-valued fuzzy reasoning algorithms based on Schweizer–Sklar t-norms and its application

PARAGRAPH

Based on the normalized Minkowski distance in Hausdorff metrics, we study the sensitivity of interval-valued Schweizer-Sklar t-norms and their corresponding residual implications.

Moreover, we investigate the robustness of interval-valued fuzzy reasoning triple I algorithms based on Schweizer–Sklar operators and illustrate the feasibility of the algorithms by a numerical example.

Finally, the interval-valued fuzzy reasoning triple I algorithms are applied to medical diagnosis.
