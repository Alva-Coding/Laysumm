ABSTRACT

TITLE

Registering and documenting the stratification of disruptions and restorations in historical edifices. The contribution of archaeoseismology in architecture

PARAGRAPH

This work deals with the application of archaeological methods and modern methodologies of point clouds survey to structural analysis, with the purpose of creating a series of products, such as Elevation Maps, Orthophotos, 3D Models, in order to highlight the building and mechanical past of the examined buildings and to further the knowledge of the territory's seismic history.

These products are to be used as a base for the study of the cognitive process of the material structure, the constructive techniques and the restoration of a specific context, of importance for future vulnerability and restoration analyses.

The present paper will focus on the trinomial “technology-archaeoseismology-earthquakes” in order to bring to the attention of the scientific community the advantages and critical issues of an innovative point of view.

The historical center of Florence and, specifically, the church of San Remigio, has been chosen as a case study to illustrate the methodology.
