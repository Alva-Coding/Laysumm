TITLE

Successful use of pure cannabidiol for the treatment of super-refractory status epilepticus

PARAGRAPH

With success in clinical trials for treatment of rare forms childhood epilepsy (Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome), cannabidiol has emerged as an exciting new addition to the physicianâ€™s toolbox.

Cannabidiol may also be effective in the treatment of other forms of epilepsy.

We present a case of extraordinarily severe seizures (super-refractory status epilepticus) in a 12-year-old girl, in which seizures resolved soon after the introduction of pure pharmaceutical cannabidiol.

Although this report does not establish definitive proof of effectiveness, this case provides a blueprint for future study.
