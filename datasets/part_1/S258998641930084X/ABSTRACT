ABSTRACT

TITLE

Adolescent-onset absence epilepsy years after resolution of childhood epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures

PARAGRAPH

We present a case series of three boys with childhood epilepsy with myoclonicâ€“atonic seizures (EMAS) who achieved complete remission during childhood only to develop absence seizures during early adolescence.

In all three cases, the recurrent seizures resolved again with antiseizure drugs, and two are currently medication-free for a second time.
