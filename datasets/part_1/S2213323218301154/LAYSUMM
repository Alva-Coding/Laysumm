TITLE

Mesial temporal extraventricular neurocytoma (mtEVN): A case report and literature review

PARAGRAPH

Extraventricular neurocytomas (EVN) are benign tumors that are generally found in children and young adults and can present in a variety of locations in the central nervous system.

EVNs located in the temporal lobe can cause drug-resistant focal seizures.

These seizures can look like lip smacking, staring, drooling and clenching of extremities.

This report presents a rare case of a mesial temporal EVN and describes the clinical, radiological, pathological, and prognostic differences of EVNs located in the mesial temporal lobe with EVNs located in the neocortical temporal lobe.

Gross total resection of mesial temporal EVNs with seizure monitoring during surgery provides an excellent prognosis and successful seizure control.
