ABSTRACT

TITLE

Autosomal dominant temporal lobe epilepsy associated with heterozygous reelin mutation: 3 T brain MRI study with advanced neuroimaging methods

PARAGRAPH

Autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE) is a genetic focal epilepsy syndrome characterized by focal seizures with dominant auditory symptomatology.

We present a case report of an 18-year-old patient with acute onset of seizures associated with epilepsy.

Based on the clinical course of the disease and the results of the investigation, the diagnosis of ADLTE with a proven mutation in the RELN gene, which is considered causative, was subsequently confirmed.

The aim of this study was to use 3 Tesla (3 T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and advanced neuroimaging methods in a patient with a confirmed diagnosis of ADTLE.

PARAGRAPH

3 T MRI brain scan and advanced neuroimaging methods were used in the standard protocols to analyzse voxel-based MRI, cortical thickness, and functional connectivity.

PARAGRAPH

Morphometric MRI analysis (blurred grey-white matter junctions, voxel-based morphometry, and cortical thickness analysis) did not provide any informative results.

The functional connectivity analysis revealed higher local synchrony in the patient in the left temporal (middle temporal gyrus), left frontal (supplementary motor area, superior frontal gyrus), and left parietal (gyrus angularis, gyrus supramarginalis) regions and the cingulate (middle cingulate gyrus) as compared to healthy controls.

PARAGRAPH

Evidence of multiple areas of functional connectivity supports the theory of epileptogenic networks in ADTLE.

Further studies are needed to elucidate this theory.
