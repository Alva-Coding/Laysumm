TITLE

A preliminary study of the effects of cannabidiol (CBD) on brain structure in patients with epilepsy

PARAGRAPH

Cannabidiol (CBD) improves seizure frequency and severity in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy, but its effects on brain structure are poorly understood.

Cannabis-induced neurotoxicity is thought to be mediated by Î”9-tetrahydrocannabidiol (THC).

However, whether a pharmaceutical-grade CBD isolate with less than 0.3% THC contributes to such effects has not been investigated to date.

We obtained imaging before and after 10-12 weeks of treatment with CBD and quantified structural brain changes with voxel- and surface-based morphometry.

This preliminary study is the first to document that CBD does not significantly change grey matter volume or cortical thickness, despite improvements in seizure control.
