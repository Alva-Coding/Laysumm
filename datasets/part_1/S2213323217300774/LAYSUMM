TITLE

Visual hallucinations: A novel complication after hemispherectomy

PARAGRAPH

We describe two patients who experienced visual hallucinations, or visions of things not actually there, following brain surgery for uncontrollable seizures.

The first patient had severe seizures at 20 months of age from brain injury due to traumatic head injury, and experienced frightening hallucinations for 3 months after having brain surgery at 3 years of age.

The second patient had seizures from malformation of tissue in the brain and experienced scary visualizations 18 months after undergoing brain surgery at 6 years of age.

In both of these patients, though hallucinations were florid, they subsided within 3-6 months.
