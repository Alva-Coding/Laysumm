TITLE

Dynamic path planning for reconfigurable rovers using a multi-layered grid

PARAGRAPH

Rovers are currently exploring other planets.

Thus, this paper proposes a novel path planning algorithm that allows them to autonomously reach places of scientific interest in an efficient way.

The objective is to minimize the energy required to reach a goal position.

The proposed algorithm considers the use of multiple modes of locomotion, which is a characteristic of reconfigurable rovers.

Moreover, this algorithm can merge satellite maps, whose resolution is limited, with detailed maps of the rover surroundings built upon its sensory information.

This is useful for recalculating the path to avoid obstacles non detected in the initial satellite maps.
