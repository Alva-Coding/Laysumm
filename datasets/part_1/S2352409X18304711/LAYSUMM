TITLE

Integrating a complex late prehistoric settlement system: Neutron activation analysis of pottery use and exchange at Saruq al-Hadid, United Arab Emirates

PARAGRAPH

This paper presents the results of a geochemical study conducted on pottery from a site in the Rubâ€™ al-Khali desert in the United Arab Emirates.

This site is unusual in that there is no evidence of permanent architecture.

It appears to have been inhabited episodically, with people continuously returning to the site from around 2000 BCE to 800 BCE and then less regularly from 800 BCE up to the recent past.

The compositional analysis of the pottery found that the people gathering at this site were integrated into the larger regional economy.
