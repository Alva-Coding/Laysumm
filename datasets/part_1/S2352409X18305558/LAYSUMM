TITLE

Archaeological recontextualization and first direct 14C dating of a “pseudo-excise” decorated antler point from France (Pégourié Cave, Lot). Implications on the cultural geography of southwestern Europe during the Last Glacial Maximum

PARAGRAPH

In France, the Badegoulian age traditionally accepted for the “pseudo-excise” decorated antler artifacts is mostly based on arguable data from old excavations and/or problematic archaeostratigraphic contexts.

We have focused our attention on Pégourié Cave (Lot, France) in order to establish the chronocultural attribution of these specific artifacts.

While an archaeostratigraphic reassessment shows that Pégourié can no longer be considered a reliable stratigraphy, direct 14C dating confirms the Badegoulian age of the “pseudo-excise” technique.

The defined chronological-range is comparable to data recently obtained in Asturias for “pseudo-excise”-yielding industries, fueling the long-lasting debate around the existence of Badegoulian-like traditions in Spain.
