ABSTRACT

TITLE

A population-based iterated greedy algorithm for no-wait job shop scheduling with total flow time criterion

PARAGRAPH

The no-wait job shop where no waiting time is allowed between two successive operations of a job has a strong industrial background, especially in steel-making industry and concrete manufacturing.

This study formulates the no-wait job shop problem with a total flow time criterion based on time difference and decomposes the problem into timetabling and sequencing subproblems.

Several timetabling methods are designed for the total flow time criterion to generate a sequence timetable.

By adopting favourable features of the iterated greedy algorithm, the population-based iterated greedy (PBIG) algorithm for the sequencing subproblem is proposed.

The individuals in the population evolve by means of a destruction and construction perturbator and an insertion-based local search.

In each iteration, a tournament selection is designed to replace a relatively worse solution.

In order to generate starting solutions with a certain quality and diversity, the Nawaz–Enscore–Ham-based heuristics for flow shop scheduling are extended in no-wait job shops.

In computational experiments based on well-known benchmark instances, timetabling methods are investigated, and it is shown that the left timetabling is superior to other timetabling methods for the total flow time minimisation.

Computational results also show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art metaheuristics, and it could be applicable to practical production environment.
