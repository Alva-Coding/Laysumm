TITLE

Genetic analyses of Scandinavian desiccated, charred and waterlogged remains of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)

PARAGRAPH

We evaluate 250â€’850-year-old Scandinavian barley grain materials preserved under three different contexts; desiccated, waterlogged and charred, for their potential to be used in genetic studies.

No traces of barley DNA were found in charred specimens.

Waterlogged specimens appeared to contain barley DNA, but in too low quantities to allow further analysis.

Desiccated samples were by far the most successful and could even be used to study population structures.

These analyses support previous claims regarding temporal preservation of population structures in southern Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark), showing that they extend from late 17th to late 19th century at least in southern Sweden.
