TITLE

Application of XRD and digital optical microscopy to investigate lapidary technologies in Pre-Pottery Neolithic societies

PARAGRAPH

Beads were an important form of personal ornamentation in Pre-Pottery Neolithic societies in the Levant.

Symbolic practices and exchange networks practiced by these communities can be revealed by establishing the mineralogical composition of stone beads and the methods used to manufacture the beads.

Here, we apply XRD and 3D digital optical microscopy to investigate raw material selection and bead manufacture from two distinct time periods at the Pre-Pottery Neolithic settlement of el-Hemmeh, Jordan.

We reveal changes in color selection, material choice, and production methods across the two time periods, linking them to broader cultural shifts.
