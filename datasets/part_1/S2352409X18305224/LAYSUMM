TITLE

Finding eulachon: The use and cultural importance of Thaleichthys pacificus on the northern Northwest Coast of North America

PARAGRAPH

The Northern Tsimshian are an Indigenous people whose homeland includes the coastal islands around the city of Prince Rupert, British Columbia, and parts of the Skeena and Nass rivers.

Each year, thousands of eulachon (small, oily fish) spawn in the lower reaches of the Nass.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Tsimshian households had rights to harvest eulachon, which were smoked, dried, or rendered into oil.

Some Northern Tsimshian households became wealthy by controlling the eulachon oil trade.

Our paper explores the deep history of eulachon fishing in the region through zooarchaeological, ethnographic, and oral historical lines of evidence.
