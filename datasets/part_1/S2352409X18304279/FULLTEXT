TITLE

Impact of biodeterioration on structure and composition of waterlogged foundation piles from Riga Cathedral (1211 CE), Latvia

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

The historic centre of Riga is included in the UNESCO World Heritage list.

Riga Cathedral (1211) is one of the oldest sacred buildings of the medieval period in Latvia and also the Baltics.

In recent years, deformations (cracks) have been observed in a number of historic buildings, including the Cathedral.

Those buildings are supported by wooden foundation piles.

Extensive research work with many expert institutions has been carried out to understand the reasons for the deterioration of Cathedral constructions.

It is found that the mortar foundation is stable but the ground complex underneath, containing wooden piles and ground material, could be the main reason for super-normative deformations.

The piles are situated under permanent groundwater; however, because of water level fluctuations, the upper parts of piles could be exposed above the water for longer periods.

The main geotechnical problem is the declined load bearing of damaged piles which is unpredictable and can lead to an increased construction's settlement in future.

PARAGRAPH

Wooden foundation piles have been used to stabilise urban settlements for thousands of years.

Depending on the local soil conditions and the building above, pile foundations differ in construction type, pile length, timber species and timber quality applied, and the degree of conservation.

It is estimated that millions of wooden foundation piles are still in service, carrying small buildings like family houses, or bigger buildings like churches and palaces or constructions in water-like quay walls or bridges.

Many of these buildings are old and therefore wooden foundations are an important asset for cultural heritage.

This is not always realised probably because foundations are hidden in the soil and therefore not visual as part of the building and because the wooden pile has been replaced by concrete since the 1950s (Klaassen and Creemers, 2012).

A number of these buildings have suffered from structural instability because their foundations have lost supporting strength.

The strength loss is associated with the activity of bacterial degradation that can colonise and destroy wood under low-oxygen conditions below the groundwater level (Huisman et al., 2008).

Studies on the microbial decay of foundation piles and archaeological wood from sites in the Netherlands (Klaassen, 2008a), Germany, Italy (Huisman et al., 2008), the Mediterranean Sea area (Palla et al., 2013) and Sweden (Björdal, 2012) have been carried out.

PARAGRAPH

Degradation of wood cell walls by bacteria was confirmed only in the 1980s.

Using light and electron microscopy, isolated bacterial consortia were observed, degrading lignified wood cells (Daniel and Nilsson, 1986).

Two main groups of wood-degrading bacteria are erosion bacteria (EB) and tunnelling bacteria (TB) (Nilsson and Daniel, 1992).

EB represent the dominant form of attack in waterlogged wood and contribute significantly to the deterioration of wooden foundation piles and waterlogged archaeological wood.

EB tolerate near anaerobic or fully anoxic environments, whereas TB appear to have a higher demand for oxygen (Björdal et al., 1999).

Modern molecular DNA technology results show that sequences representing bacteria from waterlogged archaeological wood belong to the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides (CFB) complex and the Pseudomonas group, with relatives of the Cellvibrio and Brevundimonas groups also present (Landy et al., 2008).

As a result of degradation by EB, wet wood is damaged easily and is also susceptible to damage and deformation during drying out.

Sites where oxygen was available showed evidence of degradation by soft rot (SR) fungi (Huisman et al., 2008).

SR fungi are present in aquatic and terrestrial environments in large numbers.

They are considered to have lower requirements for oxygen than basidiomycetes, which are rare in aquatic environments (Eaton and Hale, 1993).

PARAGRAPH

The aim of the present study was to investigate the reason of deterioration of foundation piles leading to the deformations of Riga Cathedral building.

The alteration in wood cell microstructure and chemical composition of piles were studied by different laboratory methods.

Materials and methods

SECTION

Pile samples

PARAGRAPH

8 foundation piles were obtained from the sondage of Riga Cathedral (1211) (Fig. 1A, B).

The piles were located in the ground consisting of loam, occasionally mixed with dolomite splinter and lime mortar in the upper part and with very dense sand in the lower part.

Unbarked piles were located in the ground with a pointed end at 15° angle.

The age of piles was estimated to be around 800 years.

The dimensions of piles ranged from 9 to 16 cm in diameter and 86 to 135 cm in length.

The upper parts of piles were soft and visually damaged; the damage was observed also in the middle and lower parts.

PARAGRAPH

5 cm thick discs were cut off the pile's upper parts and stored in a groundwater medium at the temperature of 4 °C.

A total of 16 samples were collected from the inner and outer parts of each disc for further analyses (Table 1).

The wood species, type and degree of biodegradation were determined microscopically.

Changes in wood components were analysed by chemical and instrumental methods.

SECTION

Light microscopy (LM)

PARAGRAPH

Microscopic assessment of wood samples was performed on thin, hand-cut transversal, radial and tangential sections.

First, the sections were treated with 1% safranin for selective staining of the wood tissue.

After 5 min, the stain was washed off with distilled water, and the sections were immersed in aqueous glycerine solution (1:1) and examined with a Leica DMLB microscope at magnifications of 200× and 400×.

The images were captured using a video camera Leica DFC490 using calibrated image analysis software (Image-Pro plus 6.3, Media Cybernetics, Inc.).

PARAGRAPH

The identification of wood species was done according to the key (Schoch et al., 2004).

PARAGRAPH

The degree of degradation was classified as weak (cell walls partly degraded), moderate (degraded cells in the matrix of sound cells), severe (almost all cell walls degraded), and total (all cell walls completely eroded) (Klaassen, 2008a).

SECTION

Sample preparation for analyses

PARAGRAPH

Pile samples were ground in a Retsch (Germany) mill to pass through a 0.6 mm screen.

Two replicates were analysed for each sample.

In parallel to the pile wood, sound wood samples were analysed as a reference material.

SECTION

X-ray diffraction (XRD)

PARAGRAPH

X-ray analysis was used to identify inorganic impurities in the pile samples.

X-ray spectra were recorded using 1 g of each sample by an X-ray diffractometer D8 ADVANCE (Bruker AXS GmbH, Germany) with a radiation source CuKα lamp, capacity of the tube 40 kV, current 40 mA.

The crystalline structures were determined by software DIFFRACplus Basic Evaluation Package (EVA) (Bruker).

The samples No. 15m and 15v represented the outer and inner parts of softwood, and the samples No. 26m and 26v – the respective parts of hardwood.

SECTION

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)

PARAGRAPH

FTIR spectra of the samples were recorded in KBr pellets by a FTIR spectrometer Spectrum One (Perkin Elmer, UK) in the range of 4000–450 cm−1 (resolution: 4 cm−1, number of scans: 64).

The pellet contained 2 mg of the sample and 200 mg of KBr (IR grade, Sigma Aldrich).

SECTION

Chemical analyses

PARAGRAPH

Air dried wood chips from each sample (10 g) were extracted with acetone in a Soxhlet apparatus for 8 h and, after rotary vacuum-evaporation, expressed as a percentage of the original weight of the wood sample according to TAPPI T 264.

PARAGRAPH

Klason lignin was determined according to TAPPI T 222.

1 g of the extracted sample was weighed into a locked flask, and 15 ml of 72% H2SO4 was added.

The mixture was placed in a thermostat at 25 ± 0.5 °C and stirred frequently to assure complete solution.

After 2 h, the solution was diluted and transferred quantitatively to a 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask, using 560 ml of water, and heated for 4 h.

The solution was then filtered through a Büchner funnel, dried in oven and weighted.

All results are reported relative to the 105 °C oven-dried weight of the sample.

PARAGRAPH

Kürschner-Hoffer cellulose determination is based on the delignification and acid hydrolysis of hemicelluloses.

1 g of the extracted sample was heated in a water bath at 92 °C in a reaction vessel of the concentrated nitric acid and ethanol mixture (4:1).

The procedure was repeated 3–4 times, and finally the sample was washed with warm, deionised water.

The dry substance was weighted to determine cellulose content gravimetrically.

PARAGRAPH

Ash content was determined according to TAPPI T 210.

2 g of wood chips was weighted into a crucible with a cover and placed in a muffle furnace at 575 ± 25 °C for 6 h.

After ignition, the crucible was placed in a desiccator to cool to room temperature, weighted, and the percentage of ash was calculated based on the moisture-free weight of the sample.

PARAGRAPH

Neutral sugar composition was determined by an alditol acetate procedure (Blakeney et al., 1983) after the treatment with 72% H2SO4 at room temperature for 1 h.

The acid was diluted with water to give 4% H2SO4 and heated at 121 °C for 1 h. Alditol acetates were quantified by gas chromatography GC (Agilent 6850 Series GC System, column TC17) using methyl‑α‑d-glucopyranoside as an internal standard.

The total amount of sugars was expressed as a sum of the obtained rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, galactose and glucose.

Results and discussion

SECTION

Microstructure of pile wood

PARAGRAPH

The microstructural observations were based on latewood tracheids of softwoods and latewood fibres of hardwoods because of thicker secondary walls that showed pronounced signs of degradation.

PARAGRAPH

Some piles (No. 15, 16, 17, 18-4, 18-5) were identified as pine (Pinus sylvestris), and some (No. 22, 23) as black alder (Alnus glutinosa).

One pile sample (No. 26) was totally destroyed.

The presence of vessels allowed to identify it as a hardwood (most likely, alder).

According to Klaassen (2008b), pine (Pinus sylvestris), spruce (Picea abies), larch (Larix europaea), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), oak (Quercus robur, Quercus petraea), and black alder (Alnus glutinosa) species were frequently found in (archaeological and historical) pile foundations.

PARAGRAPH

The outer layers of piles showed severe decay in all cases, while the inner parts were moderately to severely degraded.

The hardwood pile No. 26 was totally degraded.

PARAGRAPH

EB were dominant degraders of piles.

The secondary wall was preferentially degraded while compound middle lamella (CML) was not affected.

As a result, a swollen granular residual material was produced.

PARAGRAPH

An example of the moderate degradation of the inner part of the pinewood pile (No. 17v) is shown in Fig. 2, where etching from the cell lumen into the secondary wall occurred.

Few cell walls were heavily degraded, while some appeared intact.

PARAGRAPH

In severely degraded softwood and hardwood samples (Fig. 3A, B), the lumen and degraded cell walls were filled with degradation products that consisted of bacterial slime and residual lignin.

The CML remained intact.

PARAGRAPH

The presence of SR decay adjacent to the EB attack was observed in few piles (No. 15, 16, 18-4), in both the outer and inner parts.

In the cross-section, SR holes in cell wall S2 layers were observed (Fig. 4).

It is in line with Björdal et al. (1999) that SR and EB are occasionally found within the same part of wood tissue, suggesting no strong antagonistic behaviour.

Zabel and Morrell (1992) report that microbial invasion of wood is highly dependent on environmental conditions, especially on moisture and oxygen.

Within the wood tissue, local microcosms are formed where the antagonistic and symbiotic behaviour of microorganisms towards each other controls their growth, development, and wood degradation.

PARAGRAPH

In our study the detailed analyses were carried out for pile samples taken from the upper parts.

However we observed that also middle and lower parts of piles were soft and visually damaged.

It is in line with Klaassen (2008a) that foundation piles were mostly degraded along their whole length.

SECTION

FTIR spectroscopy

PARAGRAPH

FTIR spectroscopy was used to estimate the changes of the chemical composition of the studied samples.

All spectra were normalised to the highest absorption maxima in the range of 2000–450 cm−1.

The FTIR spectrum of black alder (Alnus glutinosa) wood was used as a reference sample.

The highest absorption maxima of alder wood corresponded to CO vibrations of sugars at 1054 cm−1.

After bacterial attack, the highest absorption maxima of the sample No. 23 was 1124 cm−1, that corresponded to lignin aromatic CH in-plane vibrations, but for the sample No. 26 at 1595 cm−1, that corresponded to aromatic skeletal vibrations and double bonds (Faix, 1991a).

FTIR spectra of the inner and outer parts of the sample No. 23 were quite similar, as shown in Fig. 5 and both significantly differed from the reference spectrum.

The sample No. 23 did not have many absorption bands in the range of 1200–1000 cm−1 related to polysaccharide compounds of wood, but the absorption maxima of the aromatic part of wood (lignin) were clear and much stronger.

We observed an aromatic skeletal vibration at 1595, 1510, 1426 cm−1 together with the CH deformation mainly of the lignin CH3 group at 1460 cm−1, strong absorption at 1328 cm−1 typical for syringyl and condensed guaiacyl lignin units, and aromatic CH in plane vibrations at 1124 and 1030 cm−1.

Absorption maxima at 1124 and 835 cm−1 (CH out-of-plane of syringyl units) were characteristic of hardwood lignin.

On the other hand, many absorption maxima typical for wood carbohydrate disappeared, namely, absorption at 1737, 1266 (acetate group of hemicellulose) and many absorption bands in the range of 1200–1000 cm−1 (various CO stretches typical for sugars).

PARAGRAPH

FTIR spectra of the inner part of the sample No. 26 were similar to those of the sample No. 23; however, the peak at 1595 cm−1 that corresponded to aromatic skeletal vibration plus double bond vibrations had different intensity of absorption maxima and the highest absorption.

In this case, lignin was transformed and more condensed as reported earlier by Faix (1991b).

The outer part of the sample No. 26 significantly differed from the other samples.

In this spectrum, we observed a strong absorption of inorganic silicates, SiO vibrations at 470 cm−1 and in the range of 1080–1030 cm−1 and, in addition, small peaks at 3696 cm−1 typical for the inorganic OH group.

A huge amount of inorganic compounds did not allow analysing the organic part of this sample.

For detailed analyses of inorganic compounds, X-ray spectroscopy was performed.

PARAGRAPH

Fig. 6 shows FTIR spectra of waterlogged softwood; pine wood (Pinus sylvestris) was used as the reference sample.

Waterlogged softwood contained an inorganic admixture, which was identified as calcium carbonate based on the characteristic FTIR absorbance at 1423, 895 and 712 cm−1 (Miller and Wilkins, 1952).

Our results of X-ray spectroscopy confirmed this suggestion.

The outer parts of samples contained more carbonate admixture than the inner parts of wood.

The amount of carbohydrates in archaeological softwood was significantly lower than in the reference sample, according to the FTIR absorbance in the range of 1200–1000 cm−1.

Inorganic carbonates strongly affected the spectral shape, but typical absorption maxima of guaiacyl lignin at 1515, 1461, 1423 and 1269 cm−1, especially in the case of the inner part of samples, were recognised.

PARAGRAPH

The obtained results showed that, after bacterial attack during long term waterlogged storage, the carbohydrate part of hardwood and softwood was significantly destructed.

Both hemicellulose and cellulose from the inner to outer part were degraded that coincides with the chemical analyses of this study (Tables 2, 3).

The lignin part was well preserved.

Probably, it also underwent some changes, such as condensation reactions as approved by Faix (1992).

SECTION

X-ray diffraction (XRD)

PARAGRAPH

X-ray analysis provided more elaborate information about the impurity types which were found in FTIR analysis.

The main impurities in the softwood sample No. 15v taken from the inner part of the pile were calcite (CaCO3) and quartz (SiO2) (Fig. 7B).

The calcite found in the sample had the hexagonal-rhombohedral crystal system and the quartz-hexagonal crystal system.

Quartz was hard to identify in the spectrum of the sample 15m, taken from the outer part of the softwood pile, due to the background noise and increased amount of calcite at 2Θ = 29–30 and 2Θ = 47–48 (Fig. 7A).

The sample No. 15m had four to five times stronger signal of calcite than the sample No 15v.

The increased amount of calcite in the outer part of the pile is explained by its deposition from the surrounding lime mortar, which contains this mineral as specified by Oates (1998).

PARAGRAPH

The hardwood samples No. 26v and 26m contained large amounts of impurities.

The sample No. 26v (Fig. 8B) from the inner layer of the pile contained quartz (SiO2) with the hexagonal crystal system and ferrosilite (FeSiO3) with the orthorhombic crystal system.

In the sample No. 26m (Fig. 8A) from the outer part of the pile, quartz, sodium magnesium silicate (Na2Mg2Si6O15) with orthorhombic crystals and muscovite (K0,77Al1,93(Al0,5Si3,5) O10(OH)2) with a monoclinic system were identified.

Due to the strong quartz peak at 2Θ = 26–27, the identification of other impurities in the sample No. 26m were challenging due to the background noise.

The surrounding environment with loam, sand and lime mortar promoted the accumulation of quartz minerals into the hardwood tissue.

The stronger signal of quartz deposits indicated its five times greater amount in the outer part of the pile.

PARAGRAPH

There was a clear tendency that the amount of impurities decreased from outside towards inside of piles.

The most common impurity of softwood pile samples was calcite, followed by quartz in hardwood samples.

Hardwood, compared to softwood, contained different impurities.

The pile No. 26 was totally destroyed as shown by microstructural investigations.

Also chemical analyses confirmed a high ash content in the sample No. 26 (Table 2) that showed the deposition of inorganic particles in the biodegraded wood structure.

Probably, the unique impurities were washed into the piles by water movement.

It was found (Klaassen, 2008b) that the axial water flow through pine and spruce was much – up to 100 times – faster than the radial flow.

SECTION

Chemical analyses

PARAGRAPH

The organic part of pile wood was degraded and, as a result of mineralisation, the ash content increased (Table 2).

In sound pine and alder wood, the ash content was 0.33% and 0.25%, respectively.

By pronounced degradation, the ash content increased to 33.7% in pine samples and 73.2% in totally degraded alder wood.

A higher ash content was observed in the outer part of both softwood and hardwood piles.

The long burying period of waterlogged wood and the biological deterioration caused the deposition of salts, oxides and other inorganic compounds, which constitute the composition of ash within the wood tissue.

The X-ray analyses verified the presence of different impurity types in piles, including calcite, quartz, sodium magnesium silicate and muscovite.

Macchioni et al. (2016) reported the increased ash content >50% in wood from Venice foundations.

PARAGRAPH

In all pile samples, the cellulose content significantly decreased and lignin content increased.

However, the lignin content in samples 17m and 18m4 was close to the pine control.

In this case, the recalculation of lignin content to the organic part of wood (non-ash part) was done.

The results showed an increase of lignin from 26.4% in the control to 37.0% and 49.3% in the samples 17m and 18m4, respectively.

In other samples, we also observed the influence of the high ash content on the results of organic components.

There was no pronounced difference in the loss of cellulose in the outer or inner layer.

Our microscopy investigations proved an extensive degradation of secondary cell walls, rich in cellulose, while lignin rich CML seemed to be almost intact.

The main wood cell degraders were bacteria but in some extent the attack can be attributed to SR fungi.

SR preferably degrades cellulose and hemicelluloses while lignin is not (or little) attacked (Goodell et al., 2003).

PARAGRAPH

Cellulose in hardwood samples was degraded in a higher amount than in softwood.

This can be attributed to the differences in anatomical structure and chemical composition of both wood types.

It is known (Goodell et al., 2003) that up to 95% of softwoods consists of tracheids, while hardwoods have more complicated anatomy including vessels, fibres, fibre tracheids, libriform fibres and others.

Normally hardwoods have a lower lignin content than softwoods.

A major distinction between hard- and softwoods is the type of lignin monomer.

Softwoods have guaiacyl lignin and hardwoods both syringyl and guaiacyl lignins.

Lignin has a significant role in natural wood protection with high lignin levels and presence of guaiacyl lignin which provide better natural protection than low lignin levels and syringyl lignin.

Pizzo et al. (2013) reported that polysaccharides in waterlogged wood were much more easily degradable by biotic agents than lignin, and conifers decayed more slowly than hardwoods.

PARAGRAPH

In general, the severe degree of degradation corresponded to the higher loss of cellulose (Table 2).

However, in some samples (No. 15 and 16) with severe degradation, the cellulose content still remained >25%; in contrast, in moderately degraded wood (No. 17v), the cellulose was extensively depleted.

Gelbrich et al. (2008) reported that the changes in the levels of soluble sugars, phenolic compounds, and ash content seemed not to be associated with the degree of bacterial attack in foundation piles and archaeological wood.

PARAGRAPH

Analyses of monosaccharides showed that the glucose content in the control samples after hydrolysis was the highest, followed by mannose in softwood and xylose in hardwood (Table 3).

A drastic decrease of the glucose content matched well with the cellulose reduction in degraded samples (Table 2).

PARAGRAPH

Arabinose, xylose, mannose and galactose are the main hemicellulose forming sugars.

In foundation piles, the degradation ability of hemicellulose monomers depended on a monosaccharide itself.

For example, the content of mannose and xylose in softwood and hardwood hydrolysates significantly decreased while arabinose and galactose tended to increase, especially in alder wood.

The increased content of these sugars could be (i) derived from microorganisms or (ii) linked with the restricted degradation of these sugars by microbes.

Moers et al. (1990) and Oades (1984) reported that plant-derived carbohydrates in soils are represented by relatively greater proportions of pentoses (e.g. arabinose and xylose), whereas sugars of microbial origin are relatively richer in hexoses (e.g. galactose and mannose) and deoxysugars (e.g. rhamnose).

PARAGRAPH

Table 3 shows that the Ara/Xyl ratio in softwood and hardwood was higher than in the control that indicated the restricted degradation ability of arabinose in comparison with xylose.

PARAGRAPH

The changes in the content of arabinose and galactose also depended on their location in the outer/inner part of the pile.

The degradation of these sugars was more pronounced in the outer part, because the microorganisms primarily established there.

This could be attributed to the higher intensity of the water flow that promoted the distribution of bacteria in the outer layer.

In experiments it was shown (Klaassen, 2008b) that the water flow through wooden piles could be of crucial importance in explaining the intensity and velocity of bacterial decay.

It became obvious that the species known to be more susceptible to bacterial decay, such as alder, oak, and especially pine, appeared to be most permeable to water.

SECTION

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

The Riga Cathedral wooden piles underneath the mortar foundation were mainly deteriorated by erosion bacteria and in some cases by soft rot fungi.

The degree of degradation was classified from moderate to total.

PARAGRAPH

FTIR results showed a significant reduction in the carbohydrate part of hardwood and softwood piles that coincided with chemical analyses.

The restricted degradation of hemicellulose sugars – arabinose and galactose – was characteristic of bacterial wood degradation.

The lignin part was well preserved.

PARAGRAPH

FTIR spectroscopy proved itself as a quick and efficient method for determination of wood components in archaeological pile samples in comparison with chemical method.

PARAGRAPH

The increased ash content (up to 70%) in waterlogged wood consisted of deposited salts, oxides and other inorganic compounds, including calcite, quartz, sodium magnesium silicate and muscovite.

PARAGRAPH

The piles of Riga Cathedral do not ensure the support function of mortar foundation but serve as a compound in a total ground complex (piles with a ground substance) underneath the foundation.

In the case of continuous groundwater fluctuations, it is possible that the upper parts of piles are exposed above water and subjected to active microbial degradation.

This could lead to further deformations in construction.
