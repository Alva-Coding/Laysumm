TITLE

Impact of biodeterioration on structure and composition of waterlogged foundation piles from Riga Cathedral (1211 CE), Latvia

PARAGRAPH

Riga Cathedral (1211 AD) is one of the oldest sacred buildings of the medieval period in Latvia and also the Baltics.

In recent years, deformations (cracks) have been observed in a number of Riga historic buildings, including Riga Cathedral.

These buildings are supported by waterlogged wooden foundation piles.

In this paper, the state of the art of archaeological foundation piles of Riga Cathedral was evaluated by microscopic, chemical and instrumental methods.

Severe biological deterioration caused by microorganisms in the majority of pile samples was determined.

The loss of foundation supporting strength is considered as the main reason for building deformations.
