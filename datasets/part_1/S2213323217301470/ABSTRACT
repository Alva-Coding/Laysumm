TITLE

Conjoint glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 and P/Q voltage gated calcium channel antibodies in autoimmune epilepsy: A case report

PARAGRAPH

Numerous autoantibodies are implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune epilepsy.

In the past decade, many case series reported the association of glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD 65) antibodies with epilepsy.

Conjoint presence of GAD 65 antibodies with antinuclear, anti-thyroid, and anti-parietal cell antibodies has often been demonstrated.

However, concomitant elevated levels of GAD 65 and P/Q voltage gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibodies is rare.

We report a case of autoimmune epilepsy with conjoint GAD 65 and P/Q VGCC antibodies in the absence of malignancy.

This report highlights a possible role of P/Q VGCC antibodies in the pathogenesis of autoimmune epilepsy.
