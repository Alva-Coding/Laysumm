TITLE

UAV trajectory optimization for Minimum Time Search with communication constraints and collision avoidance

PARAGRAPH

This article proposes an algorithm that optimizes the routes of several Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that search for targets with uncertain locations and dynamics as fast as possible.

The proposed ant colony based algorithm incorporates communication and collision avoidance constraints, ensuring that the UAVs are able to complete the search mission without colliding or losing communication with the ground control station.

This approach is highly relevant nowadays, because UAV flight regulations often entail monitoring the state of the UAVs during the whole mission, requiring UAV deployments with continuous communication to the ground control station.
