TITLE

IRESE: An intelligent rare-event detection system using unsupervised learning on the IoT edge

PARAGRAPH

"With the exponential growth in data production rates, the available network resources are becoming the actual bottleneck for several IoT applications where the most critical requirement is the low latency.

This implies the need to overcome the typical approach of raw data consumption happening at the opposite endpoint with respect to its production.

In the context of IoT data stream analytics, for instance, the detection of anomalies or rare events is one of the most demanding tasks, as it needs prompt detection to increase its significance.

This paper presents IRESE, a rare-event detection system able to apply unsupervised machine learning techniques on the incoming data, directly on affordable gateways located in the IoT edge.

IRESE has been tested against various audio rare-event categories, achieving precision and recall measures above 90%."" "
