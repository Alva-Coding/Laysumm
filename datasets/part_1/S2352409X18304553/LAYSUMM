The chu-nam putty excavated from the Ming Dynasty site of Baochuangchang Shipyard was analyzed.

The results proved that the putty was quite compact and mainly consisted of calcite, quartz and carboxylates.

Tung oil was applied as waterproofing agent and the mixture of jute was used to prevent it from crack.

It was well preserved and possesses good sealing property which could ensure long-time oversea voyage.

These overall revealed the shipbuilding skills of the Baochuanchang Shipyard.
