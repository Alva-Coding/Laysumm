TITLE

Diachronic variation in secondary burial practices in Bronze and Iron Age Moravia

PARAGRAPH

Different funeral traditions might have coexisted in European prehistory.

One rite is traditionally considered dominant or “normative” since it is more visible in the archaeological record, the other(s) is (are) termed less dominant or “deviant”.

Burial rites changed and transformed in time.

The 2nd millennium BCE in Central Europe is characterized by dramatic transformation in both the dominant and the less dominant burial rite as reflected by changing practices of body processing.

Cremation, bone modification with tools, and fragmentation started to prevail in funeral traditions.

The aim was possibly a quick defleshing of the body for bone curation.
