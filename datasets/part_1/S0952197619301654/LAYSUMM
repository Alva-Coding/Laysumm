TITLE

Adaptive Range Genetic Algorithm: A hybrid optimization approach and its application in the design and economic optimization of Shell-and-Tube Heat Exchanger

PARAGRAPH

The work presents a hybrid version of evolution-based Genetic Algorithm (GA) with society-based Cohort Intelligence (CI) Algorithm.

It is referred to as adaptive range GA.

The population of chromosomes in GA undergo different operations such as Selection and Crossover.

Some of the fittest chromosomes are probabilistically chosen to undergo a mutation characterized by sampling interval shrinking approach of CI.

This significantly enhanced the local search ability of GA.

The authors have validated this algorithm by solving a variety of test problems.

The practical applicability of the algorithm is demonstrated by designing three distinct cases of Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger.
