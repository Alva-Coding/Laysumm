TITLE

Population movements and identity in Postclassic Yucatan. Bioarchaeological analysis of human remains from the East Coast of the Yucatan peninsula

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Human mobility and biological affinity among Maya groups have been studied under different bioarchaeological lenses, including head shape (Sierra Sosa et al., 2014; Tiesler, 2014; Tiesler and Cucina, 2012, 2010; Tiesler and Ortega Muñoz, 2013), aDNA (González-Oliver et al., 2001; Matheson et al., 2003; Merriwether et al., 1997), dental morphology (Austin, 1978; Cucina, 2013, 2015, 2016; Cucina and Ortega-Muñoz, 2014; Cucina et al., 2008, 2009, 2018; Tiesler and Cucina, 2012; Wrobler and Graham, 2015), morphometric criteria (Cucina and Tiesler Blos, 2004; Scherer, 2007; Scherer and Wright, 2013, 2015; Serafin et al., 2013, 2014; Wrobler and Graham, 2015), as well as with trace elements (Cucina et al., 2011) and strontium and oxygen isotope ratios (Buikstra et al., 2003; Freiwald, 2011; Freiwald et al., 2014; Olsen et al., 2014; Price et al., 2006a, b, c, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2014, 2015, 2018; Scherer and Wright, 2013, 2015; Sierra Sosa et al., 2014; Wright, 2005, 2012; Wright et al., 2010; Wrobler et al., 2014).

PARAGRAPH

Scholars have pointed out that the homogeneity, low genetic variability and genetic continuity among Lowland Maya populations from Classic (250–1000 CE) to Postclassic (1000–1550 CE) periods is reflected in a continuous and intense interchange of items and genes (Austin, 1978; Cucina, 2015; Cucina and Ortega-Muñoz, 2014; Cucina and Tiesler Blos, 2004; Ibarra-Rivera et al., 2008, Serafin et al., 2013; Scherer, 2007; Scherer and Wright, 2015; Wrobler and Graham, 2015).

Connections in the form of corridors and paved roadways between main and secondary cities of the lowland Maya areas and among northern coastal localities of the Yucatan peninsula were established (Cucina, 2015; Cucina and Tiesler Blos, 2004).

PARAGRAPH

The “collapse” at the end of the Classic period and the following changes in the political spheres of influence in the region generated a population dynamic that responded to the mutated socioeconomic and political scenario.

Scholars debate the nature and the dynamics of continuous massive migrations.

Within a complex scenario that varied from region to region within the Maya realm, two main events are thought to have influenced these dynamics in the northern Maya lowlands.

The first one concerns the potential arrival at Chichen Itza of non-Maya, or “nahuatized Maya” groups, like the Chontales or Putunes around the 10th century CE — maritime traders influenced by the culture of Central Mexico (Miller, 1982; Thompson, 2003).

The second one refers to the potential migrations described by Folan et al. (2000) of groups from the Peten to the northern territories of the Yucatan peninsula on the eve of Late Postclassic (around 1200 CE).

The goal of this paper is to assess the effects that migrations had on the population structure of the East Coast of the Peninsula of Yucatan during the Late Postclassic (1200–1550 CE), through the combined lenses of strontium and oxygen isotopic analyses and dental morphology.

PARAGRAPH

The analyses of strontium and oxygen isotope ratios have been applied to study individual residential mobility in human skeletal remains across past societies (Bethard et al., 2008; Turner and Armelagos, 2012) and have been recently applied to the ancient Maya settlements (Freiwald, 2011; Price et al., 2006a, 2010, 2014, 2015; Scherer and Wright, 2015; Suzuki et al., 2018; Wright, 2012).

They allow one to identify individuals who can be considered non-local, i.e., individuals who were not born in the place (site) where they were eventually interred.

PARAGRAPH

Dental morphology, on the other hand, focuses on the extent of biological affinities resulting from biological relationships (gene flow) among populations (Austin, 1978; Cucina, 2015; Cucina et al., 2008, 2009, 2018; Cucina and Ortega-Muñoz, 2014; Cucina and Tiesler Blos, 2004; Scherer and Wright, 2013; Tiesler and Cucina, 2012; Wrobler and Graham, 2015).

These analyses provide different perspectives on population dynamics; the decision to implement both chemistry and morphology in this study rests on the concept that we are not witnessing a single migratory event from the Peten region, but an often-complex series of events that might have occurred during the span of the Postclassic, as well as from previous periods of time (from the lens of dental morphology).

It is with this in mind that we selected the skeletal collections from the archaeological sites of El Meco, El Rey and Tulum, which were fully integrated in Late Postclassic (1200–1550 CE) commerce and exchange system on the East Coast of the Peninsula of Yucatan, in the modern state of Quintana Roo, Mexico.

SECTION

The East Coast in the Postclassic period

PARAGRAPH

The East Coast of the Peninsula of Yucatan constitutes a cultural region defined by an architectural and sculptural style that flourished in the Postclassic period (Andrews, 1976, 1983, 1986; Lothrop, 1924) (Fig. 1).

It was bound to Cobá during the Late and Terminal Classic periods (800–1000 CE), then, in the next centuries to Chichen Itza and its new trading partners in the peninsula's coastal areas, where intense commercial networks arose (Cobos, 2015; González and Cobos, 2006).

There, long distance trade networks promoted coastal sites, like ports, trans-shipment stations, villages and service posts like Isla Cerritos, San Gervasio and Chac Mool.

PARAGRAPH

The onset of the second millennium AD marked important political changes, due to the collapse of Chichen Itza and of its allies, resulting in the geopolitical reorganization of the coastal region, and in the creation of provinces like Ecab, with steady economic and demographic growth beginning in the Late Postclassic period (Andrews, 1976, 1983; Barrera Rubio, 1980; Márquez Morfín et al., 1982; Vargas, 1988).

During the Late Postclassic, Mayapan established connections to coastal elites, with the exchange of raw materials, finished products, and the movement of people inside and outside of the peninsula (Serafin et al., 2013, 2014).

PARAGRAPH

The skeletal samples from the three sites analyzed here come from the Ecab province, which was characterized by a military defensive system (walled cities) that can still be appreciated at some coastal localities like Xel Ha, Xcaret, and Tulum (Vargas, 1978, 1984, 1988, 1997).

Vargas claimed that the defensive nature of these settlements suggested that different ethnic groups populated the East Coast, and that they were looking for ways to protect themselves.

SECTION

Tulum

PARAGRAPH

Tulum is the most widely known archaeological site along the east coast of the Peninsula of Yucatan (Barrera Rubio, 1980; Vargas, 1988).

It is located at 20°12′52.69″N and 87°25′45.23″O, about 400 m from the modern Tulum-Cancun highway (Fig. 1).

Tulum is an ancient city, whose walls reached 5 m in height.

Most of the masonry buildings are located inside the wall, and Andrews (1975) interpreted this as a boundary between sacred places and dwellings of commoners.

Although the history of Tulum goes back to the Classic period, the city reached its splendor during Mayapan times.

Another characteristic of Tulum is the building of a second and a third wall that restricted the access to, and protected, certain dwellings.

Vargas (1988: 99) hypothesized that the elites of Tulum did not belong to the autochthonous population of the town, and that these second and third walls served to isolate them from the rest of the population.

PARAGRAPH

The constructive splendor of Tulum in the Late Postclassic was a consequence of its hegemony in the maritime trade (Barrera Rubio, 1980), though it was also an important place of cult and religion (Miller, 1977).

Evidence of trade is seen in the presence of pottery from Tabasco and of obsidian from the deposits of the Ixtepeque region in Guatemala that arrived on the peninsula via the Gulf of Honduras (Barrera Rubio, 1980: 31, 35).

SECTION

El Rey

PARAGRAPH

El Rey is located at km 18.5 of the “Zona Hotelera” on Cancun Island, Quintana Roo.

Its coordinates are 21°, 04′, 11″ N and 86°, 46′, 51″W (Fig. 1).

The name of El Rey comes from Silvanus G. Morley and Thomas Gann who, on the occasion of their visit in 1918, named Structure 3B as “The Palace of the King (El Palacio de El Rey)” (Vargas, 1978).

During the 19th and 20th centuries, several archaeological explorations were undertaken and 60 structures were excavated and eventually restored in 1975.

The demographic peak of the archaeological site dates to the Late Postclassic period (1200–1550 CE), even though there is some evidence of occupation of the settlement in earlier times (Ramos, 1978; Ramos Rodríguez et al., 1980).

The site's main buildings and two plazas characterize the central area that divides the site in two: the northern and southern compounds.

The structures consist of residential platforms, altars, palace-style buildings and a pyramidal structure, all of them built following the East Coast architectural style (Mayer-Guala, 1990).

PARAGRAPH

The excavations during the 1970s recovered large quantities of polished lithic materials, ceramics, animal remains as well as 53 human skeletal remains deposited both inside and outside the platforms.

The inhabitants of the site participated in a maritime trade network around the Yucatan peninsula.

Foreign products like obsidian, jadeite, basalt and copper (and their by-products) were traded in exchange for goods like mollusk shells, wax, honey, fish and salt (among others).

SECTION

El Meco

PARAGRAPH

The site of El Meco is located along the road connecting Puerto Juárez/Punta Sam to Cancun, on the mainland facing Isla Mujeres (21°12′40.10″N and 86°48′14.74″O, Fig. 1).

The original name is unknown; the name of El Meco corresponds to the nickname of a local resident, owner of a coconut trees plantation in the 19th century.

Andrews (1978) suggests that the place could be Belma, the capital town of the province of Ecab; however, there is no archaeological or ethno-historical data yet that corroborates this hypothesis.

PARAGRAPH

El Meco covers a surface of some 130,000 m2.

The site arose around 300 CE as a small settlement of fishermen, later abandoned to be eventually resettled, reaching its apex during the Postclassic period (1000–1550 CE), and in particular during its later phase (1200–1550 CE) (Andrews and Robles, 1986).

The dating of the site to the (Late) Postclassic period was confirmed by the ceramic analysis (Andrews and Robles, 1986).

The archaeological material (goods from the Gulf of Mexico and Central America) suggests that the site was an important trading port, because of its strategic location.

At the same time, the site was also an important religious center given its closeness geographically to Isla Mujeres.

PARAGRAPH

Only the civic-ceremonial complex, which consists of three plazas, has been explored so far.

This complex is formed by fourteen larger structures, alongside a pyramidal building.

This pyramid is the tallest on the entire East Coast of the peninsula and has five construction phases.

Twenty residential structures and altars, all in the East Coast style, surround the central plaza.

SECTION

Material and methods

PARAGRAPH

The skeletal collection from El Rey consists of 47 skeletons, excavated in 1976, 2006, and 2013 (Mayer-Guala, 1990; Terrones González et al., 2009), while 47 skeletons from El Meco,were excavated in 1998 and 2002 (Leira, 2002).

All of the burials from El Meco and El Rey were primary interments.

The remains from Tulum, recovered from six different structures excavated in 1980, are largely ossuary burials (Cívera, 1998:267).

These individuals belong to the Late Postclassic according to ceramic associated with each burial (Cívera, 1998; Leira, 2002; Ramos, 1978; Terrones González et al., 2009).

PARAGRAPH

Every individual was analyzed for sex and age at death.

Sex was determined using the degree of cranial and pelvic morphological dimorphism in the adult segment of the population (Ferembach et al., 1979; Phenice, 1969).

Sex cannot be determined in young subadults.

Age at death was estimated in adults using the methodology described in Lovejoy et al. (1985a, b) and Meindl and Lovejoy (1985); in subadults by tooth formation and eruption (Bass, 1995:289–290).

PARAGRAPH

The analysis of these remains employs two analytical approaches: isotope analysis and dental morphology.

Dental morphology is based on the information reported in Cucina et al. (2008, 2009) and Cucina (2015, 2016).

It was scored on all permanent teeth available for analysis; for every individual, a total of 79 dental morphological traits are recorded, according to each trait's degree of expression, following the ASUDAS guidelines (Arizona State University Dental Anthropology System - Turner et al., 1991).

Once all traits had been scored, they were either dichotomized into present or absent (Scott and Turner, 1997), where teeth traits manifesting degrees of expression below the thresholds were considered as absent, while those equal to or above the thresholds were considered as present, or into ranges of degree of expression (i.e., absent, moderately expressed or fully expressed) (Cucina, 2015).

Twenty-four traits, for a total of 36 variables, were selected for statistical analyses among those that showed the highest degree of variability, and after traits showing high correlation with one another were removed (Cucina, 2015).

PARAGRAPH

For dental morphology, we examined 28 individuals from El Meco, 36 from El Rey and a minimum number of 62 from Tulum belonging to both sexes (this analysis was performed by AC and AOM).

Original statistical analyses included UPGMA-based (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean) and Ward's-based Cluster Analyses, Principal Component Analysis and Maximum Likelihood, and were performed using Statistica package (StatSoft®) (Cucina, 2015).

PARAGRAPH

Conversely, for analysis of intra-site morphological variability, all 79 traits were used in their present or absent form.

Such variability was calculated as the average value from all 79 traits based on the 2 ∗ xi ∗ yi formula, where xi and yi represent the frequency of presence and absence of each dichotomized trait (Cucina, 2013, 2016).

It rests on the assumption that the highest degree of variability of a dichotomized trait is reached when its frequency equals 50%.

PARAGRAPH

The strontium (87Sr/86Sr) and oxygen (δ18O) isotopes analysis provides information on past human movement (Knudson, 2007; Price et al., 2000, 2002).

The strontium isotopes in human bones and teeth come from the food — the plants and animals — of the place where the individual lived when these tissues were forming, so that they reflect the geology of the local environment.

Oxygen isotopes enter human tissues from drinking water and are related to rainfall in the region.

Oxygen isotope ratios in rainfall vary geographically with latitude, temperature, elevation, distance from water source, and amount of rainfall.

Tooth enamel incorporates strontium and oxygen from the gestational period until the early childhood and remains largely unchanged through life.

Thus, the isotope ratios in the enamel of those teeth forming in the early years of life (like the permanent first molar) are a marker of the place of birth and early infancy (Katzenberg, 2008:413; Knudson, 2007).

PARAGRAPH

Therefore, if an individual has a ratio of strontium and/or oxygen in his/her teeth that differs from that of the place of death, it can be inferred that the individual had moved from his/her place of origin.

On the contrary, if the isotope ratio of the burial place is similar to that in the tooth enamel, it is likely that the individual died and was interred near his/her place of birth.

PARAGRAPH

The isotopic signature of the place of burial is obtained to provide baseline data for a study (Price et al., 2002).

It is obtained by ratios of strontium from local fauna samples, like mice, deer, peccary, shells, and land snails (Price et al., 2000, 2006b, 2010).

Price et al. (2008, 2010) provide baseline sample averages and inter-quartile ranges of isotopic measurements from different regions of Mesoamerica (Tables 1 and 2).

Local values for El Rey and Tulum were obtained from faunal samples (gopher teeth) collected directly at the archaeological sites.

Local values for El Meco are not available due to the lack of fauna samples in the archaeological record of the site.

However, Wright (2012:339) suggested that “…we can expect the majority of the population to have been born locally at most sites, and if they consumed locally grown foods and the local environment is geologically monotonous, we should expect a normal distribution of Sr isotope ratios”.

This implies that, given the stability of certain dietary and environmental variables, the plateau of individuals' isotopic signature at any site should be representative of the isotope's local range of variability.

PARAGRAPH

The human archaeological sample consists of 37 individual teeth, divided into 29 first molars, seven second molars and a third molar (four individuals from Tulum, 13 from El Meco, and 20 from El Rey).

As regards El Meco, 11 individuals were from domestic context, and two from palace context (Leira, 2002).

Six individuals from El Rey are from a domestic context, eight from ritual-domestic contexts and six individuals have an unknown context.

At Tulum, the four individuals are from the structures inside the city wall in a domestic context (Table 4).

Dental morphology

PARAGRAPH

Cucina (2015) and Cucina et al. (2008, 2009, 2018) noted that the three sites, although geographically close to one another and with shared cultural elements, are not biologically very similar.

Within the complex and entangled population dynamics that characterized the peninsula during Classic and Postclassic times, El Meco and El Rey are morphologically closer to each other than to Tulum (Cucina, 2015); the latter tends to more closely resemble other coastal and inland sites (Fig. 2).

PARAGRAPH

The picture obtained from the perspective of intra-site morphological variability (Cucina, 2013), instead indicates that Tulum manifests one of the lowest levels of heterogeneity (0.1797) in comparison with El Meco (0.2061) and El Rey (0.2148).

The overall level of heterogeneity from a total of twenty-four samples ranges between 0.1748 and 0.2478 (Cucina, 2013).

SECTION

Strontium and oxygen isotopes

PARAGRAPH

The mean isotopic values of 87Sr/86Sr of the human teeth for Tulum is 0.7089 (±0.0003), for El Meco is 0.7091 (±0.00001) and for El Rey is 0.7090 (±0.0003) (Table 3).

El Meco has more homogeneous isotopic values than El Rey and Tulum.

Tulum has most varied isotopic values of the three collections analyzed (Fig. 3), even though only one individual could be foreign (ID F9212, Table 3).

This individual, recovered from an ossuary context, was a 25 to 35 years old male, with parallelepiped cranial modification.

His 87Sr/86Sr value was 0.7083, and his place of origin could be in the inland territories of the northern Lowlands, or along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Fig. 4).

Similar geographical origins could be inferred from the analysis of oxygen isotopes (δ18O = −2.6) (Fig. 5, Table 2).

PARAGRAPH

At El Meco, all the individuals analyzed are locals from the east coast of the Peninsula of Yucatan, according to the baseline values of local fauna (values of animal teeth of El Rey and Tulum we used as proxy data; they show the same isotopic ratios – 87Sr/86Sr = 0.7092 and 0.7091 respectively).

Oxygen δ18O values are very homogeneous, with a median of −3.0 (ranging from −2.8 to −3.9), and hence these individuals were likely born in the northern region of the Yucatan peninsula, in Belize or along the Gulf Coast (Fig. 5).

PARAGRAPH

At least four individuals of the 20 analyzed at El Rey (20% of the sample) seem to be non-local (ID: F9243, F9240, F9232 and F9244; Table 3).

The first is the individual from Burial 28 (ID F9243), which was found in a ritual-religious context.

It is an adult of undetermined sex, who died at an age older than 30 years, with a tabular erect/intermediate variant cranial modification.

He had been interred in a secondary and indirect context, and it is possible that he belonged to the commoner class.

The 87Sr/86Sr value is 0.708064 and δ18O is −4.5; these values indicate either territories in the southern lowlands, like Tikal (87Sr/86Sr = 0.7080) or the Gulf Coast of Mexico (87Sr/86Sr = 0.7080) (Table 1 and Fig. 4).

PARAGRAPH

The second is Burial 23-1 (ID F9240), a female beyond 30 years of age, without cranial modification and recovered from a domestic context; she too had been interred in a secondary and indirect context and belonged to the commoner class.

Her strontium value is 0.7085 and δ18O is −1.5.

The origin of this individual could be the northern coast of Belize (Fig. 4) or northern Peten based on the δ18O (Fig. 5).

The third individual is Burial 7 (ID F9232), a 30 years old male sporting a tabular erect modification.

The grave goods associated to this individual included a jade plate, tweezers and a copper ax, a deer antler, pottery vessels and 32 snail shells, all in a ritual-religious context.

The associated materials suggest that this individual pertained to the site's elite class.

The 87Sr/86Sr value is 0.7088 and δ18O is −1.2.

The place of origin could be along the northwestern coast of the Yucatan peninsula and the oxygen isotopic values are enriched (Price et al., 2010).

PARAGRAPH

Burial 32 (ID F9244) is a female of unknown age, with tabular erect deformation found with an obsidian knife in a domestic context, interred in a primary and direct way.

The isotopic values are: 87Sr/86Sr, 0.7090 and δ18O, −2.9.

While the strontium ratio seemingly indicate that she was local, or from some place in the northern lowland territories (range inter-quartile 87Sr/86Sr = 0.7087–0.7090, Table 1), the oxygen value seemingly indicates the Peten or northern Peten region (Table 3, Fig. 5).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The debate concerning the origins of the population that settled on the East Coast of the Peninsula of Yucatan in prehispanic times still has not reached clear and definitive answers.

The question whether the Classic period Mayas were replaced by foreign groups like the Chontales was initially supported mainly by historical sources (Miller, 1982; Thompson, 2003).

However, Cobos (2015) questioned this hypothesis, stating that population continuity characterized the region at the onset of the Postclassic, implying that the cultural changes evidenced in the material record at Chichen Itza were not the result of massive migrations.

PARAGRAPH

Similarly, mitochondrial DNA studies carried out in the region show differences in the composition of haplogroups among various parts of the Maya area (González-Oliver et al., 2001; Matheson et al., 2003; Ibarra-Rivera et al., 2008) and suggest migratory waves from different territories and quite possibly from the Peten region.

Yet, the people who inhabited the northern and central territories of the East Coast of the Peninsula of Yucatan, despite having a homogeneous “cultural” substrate expressed by architecture and pottery types (Andrews, 1976, 1983, 1986; Andrews and Robles, 1986; Vargas, 1978, 1984, 1988), exhibit varied socio-cultural and mortuary patterns (Cucina et al., 2018), as well as economic and biological dynamics within and between sites.

PARAGRAPH

It must be remembered that population dynamics are the result of complex systems and the Yucatan peninsula was not an exception.

We cannot dismiss, therefore, the idea that the biological and cultural structure of the population along the East Coast of the peninsula might have been the result of population movements from various parts of the region through time, including the southern and northern coastal and inland territories of the Maya lowlands.

PARAGRAPH

In this perspective, during the Classic period, the evidence from trace elements and from isotopes of strontium and oxygen (Cucina et al., 2011; Price et al., 2010, 2014) suggests relationships between the northern and inland sites of the peninsula with the Guatemalan Peten and various other parts of the northern Maya lowlands.

Similarly, dental morphology suggests the presence of inland corridors connecting the northern Peten region to the northern peninsula's inland sites during Classic times (Cucina, 2015).

The coastal regions likely experienced the influence of different migratory paths that occurred along the coasts, as a common pattern of dental morphology seemingly emerges among coastal sites of the Classic and Postclassic periods (Cucina, 2015).

PARAGRAPH

Instead, head shaping analyses performed by Tiesler and Ortega Muñoz (2013) showed that the upper flat, erect modeling “parallelepiped” forms that resulted in a conic look, and whose origins can be traced to the West Coast areas, initially appeared on the peninsula during the Late Classic, but became common in the central localities of the peninsula's East Coast only during the Late Postclassic (for the “parallelepiped” term see Tiesler, 2014).

The authors have showed that erect modeling variants are diverse, in particular at the central site of the East Coast (Tulum) and at San Gervasio (on the island of Cozumel).

On the contrary, in places like El Meco and El Rey, the conical variant has not been detected, while common variants within the erect form were the norm.

PARAGRAPH

Our isotopic analyses of the population of El Rey indicates that at least 20% of the sample was non-local from various areas of the Yucatan Peninsula and even outside, with potential ties to the Peten.

This percentage of immigrants is comparable with Copan during Classic period (Price et al., 2010) or coastal sites like Xcambó (Sierra Sosa et al., 2014).

PARAGRAPH

This pattern fits with the hypothesis of Ramos Rodríguez et al. (1980) that suggests the existence of commercial and demographic corridors from the Peten to the East Coast from the Late Classic, which could have lasted until the Late Postclassic.

This high variability and pattern of population migration contrasts with the homogeneity of the cranial silhouettes of the inhabitants of El Rey.

This has to do with the replacement of the oblique silhouettes with erect forms from Classic to Postclassic times (Tiesler, 2014; Tiesler and Ortega Muñoz, 2013); this pattern is particularly visible in coastal areas in comparison with inland settlements that still tended to perform oblique cranial modifications (Tiesler, 2014).

At El Rey all the head shapings follow the erect form (as Table 4 shows).

Of the variants forms within the tabular erect, El Rey presents three cases of intermediate and three of occipital plane forms, which is slightly more varied than at El Meco, which only shows intermediate variants.

However, out of the four non-locals, only one shows an intermediate form.

It is too small a sample to make inferences on the possible correlation between individuals' mobility and head shape.

We are aware of the limits imposed by small sample size, and the need to expand the sample of individuals to have a better picture of migration to the coast during the Late Postclassic.

PARAGRAPH

No sex-specific pattern could be detected among the people who migrated to El Rey, and the migrants could be recovered from both elite and commoners contexts.

This is in agreement with that reported by Price et al. (2010, 2014) who observed foreigners among both high and low status social classes.

The wide array of areas of possible origin for the foreigners of El Rey follows a pattern that has already been reported in cities like Tikal (Scherer and Wright, 2013), Copán (Price et al., 2010, 2014), Xunantunich (Freiwald et al., 2014) or Xcambó (Cucina et al., 2011; Sierra Sosa et al., 2014).

PARAGRAPH

Cucina et al. (2009) argued at the time that the site of Tulum maintained some biological proximity to locality of Champotón, suggesting that this may have been the result of a biological pre-Chontal or Chontal substrate, whose presence becomes noticeable on the coasts of the Yucatan peninsula.

The reduced morphological variability suggests that the collection was somehow genetically isolated and could not have been representative of the local population, probably buried outside the wall (Cucina, 2015).

Serafin et al. (2013, 2014) comment that some Late Postclassic individuals buried in mass graves at Mayapan could belong to foreign elites of the northwestern (coastal) Yucatan.

PARAGRAPH

Isotopic data indicate that the only foreign individual from Tulum may have come from the northern part of the peninsula or from the Gulf Coast, suggesting that Tulum contained a largely locally-born population (even though the small sample size suggests caution in making final interpretations).

In this perspective, the cranial deformation patterns at Tulum add important evidence.

Tiesler (2012) assigned the extreme upper-flattened and conical forms as an ethnic marker linked to Prehispanic maritime trade systems.

They increased in frequency in northern Yucatan as a consequence of the pan-coastal mobility from the Gulf Coast, which spread head shape styles that were typical of specific sectors of the population, such as the merchants.

Again, the foreign individual at Tulum sported a parallelepiped deformation or upper-flattened form suggesting the ethnic feature identifying an individual from the area of the Gulf of Mexico.

PARAGRAPH

Finally, El Meco was a small town that showed dental morphological affinity with the neighboring population of El Rey.

The site is not one with the highest levels of intra-site variability; this, coupled with homogeneity in cranial forms, as well as an eminently local population, both in terms of elite people and the general population, indicate a homogeneous, local population not subject to (intensive) immigration and complex population dynamics.

Although Andrews (1978) hypothesized that El Meco could have been the capital town of the province of Ecab, more recently Andrews and Robles (1986) proposed that El Meco was indeed a secondary town in the province of Ecab, and of relatively low importance in the regional trading system.

Future bioarchaeological work involving the analysis of a greater number of individuals could sustain this hypothesis.

Conclusion

The results of the combined analyses of Sr isotopes and dental morphology do contribute to the ongoing discussion on the peopling of the East Coast in pre-Hispanic times.

Results indicate that the East Coast of the Peninsula of Yucatan during the Late Postclassic, despite some homogeneity in material culture (architecture and ceramics), was diverse in social, cultural, biological and demographic characteristics.

As at other archaeological sites dated to the Classic and Postclassic, non-local people, where detected, did not originate from a single region, but from a wide array of potential sources of out-migration.

This suggests a complex and entangled set of biological and cultural relationships throughout the Maya territories.

Individual dynamics depended on the importance and centrality of each site in terms of its own commercial and strategic position.

Tulum, set at the southern boundary of the province of Ecab, was configured as an endogamic population of elites in the northern region of the Yucatan peninsula, with few morphological affinities with the neighboring sites.

El Rey, on the contrary, was a town of high biodiversity, population mobility and growth, and in a strategic location especially for trade.

Last, El Meco was a secondary site, with some level of morphological affinity with El Rey.

The site' secondary position is evident in the people's biocultural, chemical and demographic homogeneity in comparison to the other sites located along the eastern coast of the peninsula, right before the contact with the Spaniards.

However, it is important to stress that reduced sample size and commingled burial context, in particular for Tulum, limit the extent of inferences from the isotopic data.
