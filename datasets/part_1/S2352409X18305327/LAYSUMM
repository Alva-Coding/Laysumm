TITLE

Population movements and identity in Postclassic Yucatan. Bioarchaeological analysis of human remains from the East Coast of the Yucatan peninsula

PARAGRAPH

Different hypotheses exist to explain settlement on the East Coast of the Yucatan Peninsula during Late Postclassic.

The analyses of dental morphology, 87Sr/86Sr and Î´18O isotopic data of the human skeletal of El Meco, El Rey, and Tulum (AD 1200-1550) depict different scenarios.

El Meco consists of local people only, while 20% are considered as foreigners at El Rey.

Tulum has the most varied isotopic values.

Yet, Tulum and El Meco display lower dental morphological heterogeneity, while El Rey shows high morphological variability.

On regional population dynamics, our results indicate broad trends in population movement along the Yucatecan coast.
