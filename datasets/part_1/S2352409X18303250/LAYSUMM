TITLE

Integrated characterization of ancient burial mounds using ERT and limited drillings at the Hepu Han Tombs, in coastal area of Southern China

PARAGRAPH

The Hepu Han Tombs, located on the south coast of China, can date back to the Han dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD), when Hepu was an important international trade port of the maritime Silk Road, spreading strong and persistent cultural influence to neighboring countries from ancient China, and also connecting China with African, European and other Asian countries in national migration, religious communication, political, trade, technical and cultural exchanges, and so on.

With the aim of detecting two burial mounds at Jinjiling Site of Hepu Han Tombs, ERT and limited drillings were performed in the area.
