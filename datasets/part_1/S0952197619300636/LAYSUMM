TITLE

On the regulation of personal data distribution in online advertising platforms

PARAGRAPH

Online advertising builds on a system (real-time bidding, RTB) where ad impressions are auctioned among hundreds of advertisers interested in displaying their ads.

Tons of user data are provided to such advertisers in order to guide their bidding decision and maximize the profit of ad platforms.

However, serious risks to privacy arise.

We propose a system that regulates user data distribution to potentially interested bidders by limiting the number of participants in auctions.

Our system is designed to ensure that the revenue of ad platforms is maximized while the abuse of malicious advertisers is prevented to a large degree.
