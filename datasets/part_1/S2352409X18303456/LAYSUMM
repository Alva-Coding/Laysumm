TITLE

A handful of fractured bifaces. “Caching” hunter-gatherer variability in the Tar River valley (Santa Cruz, Argentine Patagonia)

PARAGRAPH

Los Bifaces site comprises an assemblage of at least 11 bifaces that were recovered on a surface of 2 m².

They show intermediate stages of manufacture and would have been deposited at the same time and in a grouped manner.

The high percentage of intentional fractures should be noted.

Los Bifaces site is understood as a cache formed during the first moments of the settlement of the Tar and San Martín glacial lakes basin, and fractures are related to a ritual behavior.

This broadens the considerations on caching and hunter-gatherer occupations in southern Patagonia.
