ABSTRACT

TITLE

Effects of fermentation on the carbon and nitrogen isotopes of Chinook salmon

PARAGRAPH

Fermentation is seldom considered in paleodietary analyses of Arctic and Subarctic peoples despite its ubiquitous traditional use as a cooking technique in high latitudes.

Further, chemists have yet to assess the potential isotopic effects of fermentation on animal tissues, though isotopic research has documented measurable isotopic effects associated with other cooking techniques such as stewing and boiling.

To measure the effects of fermentation on stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes, muscle tissues from 11 central Alaskan Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were fermented following ethnographic methods.

The results of this experiment demonstrate statistically significant isotopic differences in both carbon (−1.5‰) and nitrogen (+1.3‰) values taken from fermented muscle tissues compared to raw muscle tissues.

Additionally, this study found a significant physiological fractionation effect between bone collagen and raw muscle (+3.3‰) consistent with previous research on Pacific salmon.

In contrast to previous research, however, these tissues' nitrogen values show no significant fractionation.

These findings have implications for central Alaskan dietary reconstructions, residue analyses, and our understanding of past subsistence practices in the Arctic and Subarctic.
