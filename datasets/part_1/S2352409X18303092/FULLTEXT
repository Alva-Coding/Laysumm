TITLE

Effects of fermentation on the carbon and nitrogen isotopes of Chinook salmon

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Dietary reconstructions are fundamental to anthropological assessments of past human behavior.

During the last half-century, archaeologists have increasingly based dietary reconstructions on isotopic data.

In contrast to faunal or paleobotanical analyses, an isotopic analysis can be directly applied to human remains to evaluate the types of food that individuals consumed in the past.

However, accurate isotopic dietary reconstruction requires precise isotopic baseline values for food items in the trophic web (Schwarcz, 1991).

Further, recent isotopic research has shown that certain food processing or cooking techniques have a significant isotopic effect, and therefore, dietary reconstructions on past human populations must also account for the effects of food processing techniques (Warinner and Tuross, 2009; Brettell et al., 2012).

Fermentation is a culturally and historically significant fish processing technique, and it may yield a recognizable isotopic effect that anthropologists have yet to incorporate into isotopic dietary mixing models (Speth, 2017; Tanasupawat and Visessanguan, 2014).

PARAGRAPH

The two central goals of this study are 1) to characterize potential changes in carbon and nitrogen isotopic values associated with the fermentation of raw salmon muscle tissue and 2) to measure the isotopic offset in carbon and nitrogen between bone collagen and muscle tissue from 11 central Alaskan Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha).

The research presented here has significant potential for future archaeological studies because it provides initial measurements on the isotopic effects of fermentation in fish and records average isotopic differences between salmon bone collagen and muscle tissue caused by physiological fractionation.

This study offers new isotopic data that can be applied to Arctic dietary reconstructions that could establish the antiquity of fish fermentation and salmon consumption across the Arctic and Subarctic.

Isotopic research and dietary reconstruction

PARAGRAPH

Anthropologists measure the relative abundance of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes preserved in bone to reconstruct the diets of past peoples and our hominin relatives through linear mixing models (Schwarcz and Schoeninger, 2011; Bocherens et al., 2005; Lee-Thorp and Sponheimer, 2006; Richards et al., 2003).

This functions on a basic principle, aptly put by DeNiro and Epstein (1976): “You are what you eat (plus a few per mil).”

The nitrogen and carbon isotopes preserved in our tissue correlate with the isotopes that we consume.

International standards are set for carbon and nitrogen isotopes: Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) and AIR, respectively.

These standards represent the ratio of 13C to 12C and 15N to 14N, and this ratio is noted in delta units per mil (δ13C ‰ and δ15N ‰).

PARAGRAPH

Isotopic chemists have identified several consistent isotopic fractionation effects by measuring the average isotopic composition of modern plant and animal samples, and anthropologists have employed these data to successfully reconstruct past diets (DeNiro and Epstein, 1978; van der Merwe, 1982; Lee-Thorp et al., 1989; Schoeninger et al., 1983).

Isotopic studies have found consistent fractionation effects associated with metabolic processes, such as the photosynthetic pathways in C3 and C4 plants (Calvin and Benson, 1949).

Archaeologists have applied this information to human remains and archaeological features to identify the spread of maize cultivation across the Americas (Vogel and van der Merwe, 1977; Chisholm and Matson, 1994; Burleigh and Brothwell, 1978).

Both nitrogen and carbon isotopic values increase with trophic level, particularly in marine ecosystems (DeNiro and Epstein, 1981; Gannes et al., 1997; Bocherens and Drucker, 2003).

Upon this principle, anthropologists have attempted to quantify the amount of fish in hunter-gatherer diets (Schoeninger et al., 1983; Chisholm et al., 1982) and estimate the amount of meat in Neanderthal diets (Richards et al., 2001).

PARAGRAPH

Successful dietary reconstructions rely on baseline isotopic data that document the physiological fractionation of dietary items, or the differential routing of isotopes that occurs during the formation of bone collagen, muscle, and other tissues (Gannes et al., 1997; Schoeninger and Deniro, 1984; Schwarcz, 1991; Tieszen et al., 1983).

Bone collagen typically has higher δ13C values than other tissues because it is largely composed of isotopes from dietary protein rather than bulk diet isotopes (Gannes et al., 1997).

The physiological fractionation of nitrogen isotopes varies by animal and by diet, with previous studies on fish suggesting that bone collagen nitrogen values are typically lower than muscle tissue values (Misarti, 2007; Sholto-Douglas et al., 1991).

Arctic and Subarctic dietary reconstructions consistently seek to investigate the amount of fish in past diets (Choy et al., 2016; Misarti et al., 2009), and this research depends on mixing models that accurately account for differences between tissues that would have been consumed, such as muscle tissue or organs, and tissues found in archaeological contexts, such as bone collagen.

Additional background isotopic data on larger cohorts of fish from distinct geographic areas can improve the accuracy of these models and refine our understanding of past Arctic subsistence.

PARAGRAPH

Archaeologists have successfully applied isotopic data on dietary items to archaeological remains but have rarely considered the effects of food preparation techniques, or cooking, on the isotopic chemistry of potential dietary inputs.

During the first decade of isotopic paleodietary research, isotopic chemists established that moderate heat does not affect the isotopic composition of carbon or nitrogen in bone collagen (DeNiro et al., 1985).

However, recent experimental studies have measured significant effects associated with heat-based cooking (i.e. roasting, boiling, smoking) on carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopes in cooked foods (Brettell et al., 2012; Royer et al., 2017; Doering, 2017).

Additionally, a recent study also measured a significant isotopic effect in consumers of alkaline-cooked foods (Warinner and Tuross, 2009).

This recent research highlights the importance of investigating potential isotopic effects associated with ethnographically-significant cooking techniques.

PARAGRAPH

Importantly, no anthropological studies have attempted to measure the isotopic effects of fermentation, a ubiquitous Arctic cooking technique that is applied to salmon and numerous other fish species to this day (Tanasupawat and Visessanguan, 2014; Starks, 2011; Skåra et al., 2015).

Further, the complex exchange of carbon- and nitrogen-based molecules that comprise fermentation suggests a potential isotopic effect in bulk carbon and nitrogen values.

If fermentation is associated with isotopic fractionation, isotopic dietary reconstructions may be able to identify past Arctic fermentation and fermented food consumption.

SECTION

The biochemical effects of fermentation

PARAGRAPH

Fermentation is a food processing technique that encompasses bacterial actions that produce desirable and significant biochemical modifications associated with putrefaction in food products (Campbell-Platt, 1987).

During fermentation, two important biochemical processes take place that could produce an isotopic effect in salmon tissue: the off-gassing of volatiles and the bacterial production of lactic acid.

As lipids break down in muscle tissue, several nitrogenous volatiles are released, such as ammonia (NH3), putrescine (C4H12N2) and cadaverine (C5H14N2; Kuley et al., 2012, Abdel-Aziz et al., 2016, Cobaugh, 2013, Metcalf et al., 2016).

Isotopic chemists have associated the off-gassing of nitrogenous volatiles during the decomposition of plant matter with isotopic fractionation in nitrogen (Tolstikhin and Marty, 1998; Delwiche and Steyn, 1970).

This research has shown that lighter isotopes are released more easily, resulting in a significant increase in the nitrogen values of the decomposing substrate.

A similar effect may occur during the fermentation of salmon.

PARAGRAPH

Effective fish fermentation depends on lactic acid (C3H6O3) to eliminate harmful bacteria and preserve the final food product (Vandenbergh, 1993).

Naturally-abundant lactic acid bacteria introduce significant amounts of this acid into putrefying tissue, which may affect the carbon isotopic composition of fermented foods (Leroy and De Vuyst, 2004; Vandenbergh, 1993; Abdel-Rahman et al., 2013).

Lactic acid forms through a complex bacterial metabolic process that draws carbon indiscriminately from surrounding organics, including lighter carbon isotopes from the soil (Ehleringer et al., 2000).

Significant decreases in bulk carbon isotopic signatures could reflect the complex metabolic action of lactic acid bacteria and would signal another potential isotopic effect associated with fermentation.

Salmon fermentation in the Arctic

PARAGRAPH

Through isotopic chemistry, archaeologists have established that central Alaskans have incorporated spawning salmon into their diets for at least 11,500 years (Halffman et al., 2015; Choy et al., 2016).

Arctic peoples have developed many strategies for preserving salmon long after their inland migration, including smoking, drying, and fermentation (Anderson et al., 1998; Fienup-Riordan, 1986; McKennan, 1959).

Among these storage techniques, fermentation provides many unique benefits.

Lactic acid produced during the fermentation process increases mineral solubility and facilitates the absorption of critical micronutrients (Reddy and Pierson, 1994).

Fermentation also preserves B and C vitamins because it does not involve heat and stifles the oxidation of lipids, or oxidative rancidity (Reddy and Love, 1999; de Moreno de LeBlanc et al., 2015; Kuley et al., 2012).

Additionally, fermentation does not require wood or any of the finite resources required of smoking, roasting, or the construction of drying racks (Speth, 2017).

Trees are absent in the Arctic today and were scarce in the Subarctic until after 6000 years ago (Anderson et al., 2003).

Fermentation is comparatively well-suited to salmon preservation in the Subarctic and Arctic because it entails a relatively small material investment and results in a nutritious product.

PARAGRAPH

Today and in the recent past, Alaskans ferment salmon en masse after their mid-summer migration to interior spawning locations using a range of fermentation techniques that follow a general pattern (Table 1).

Ethnographic and historic reports describe how people across the Subarctic typically placed whole salmon, salmon heads, or salmon roe in organic-lined subterranean pits during the autumn for at least two weeks to produce fermented salmon that could be stored through the winter (Shaffer et al., 1990; Spray, 2002; Miller and Jefferys, 1761; Munn, 1922).

The salmon fermentation method used in this study (Section 2.1) reflects the practices recorded in historic and ethnographic descriptions.

PARAGRAPH

The contemporary ubiquity of fish fermentation in Alaska and the Arctic hints at its potential importance in the past.

Indeed, Alaskan archaeologists have identified several late Holocene features lined with preserved birch bark at archaeological sites in coastal and central Alaska that reflect the potential antiquity of this technique (AHRS, 2018).

Yet, unlike heat-based cooking, archaeologists and paleoanthropologists have made few attempts to trace the origins of this traditional food processing technique (Speth, 2017).

Discovering an isotopic effect associated with fermentation could allow Arctic archaeologists to track the role of this technique diachronically through isotopic analyses applied to human remains and archaeological features.

Identifying the isotopic correlates of fish fermentation has the potential to enhance our understanding of past subsistence and storage practices in the Arctic and Subarctic.

Hypotheses

PARAGRAPH

The primary objective of this study was to measure the effects of fermentation on carbon and nitrogen isotopes in muscle tissue from spawning Chinook salmon.

I hypothesize fermented samples will demonstrate significant differences from raw samples in bulk carbon and nitrogen isotopic values due to the biochemical reactions associated with fermentation.

I predict that the off-gassing of ammonia (NH3) and other volatiles would yield an overall increase in δ15N values as lighter isotopes are more susceptible to volatility (DeNiro and Epstein, 1981; Schoeninger and Deniro, 1984).

As lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid during the process of fermentation, I also predict that the overall δ13C values of fermented tissue will decrease as they will contain an abundance of lactic acid composed of lighter carbon isotopes from the surrounding soil (Ehleringer et al., 2000).

PARAGRAPH

The secondary objective of this study was to measure the physiological fractionation between raw muscle tissue and extracted bone collagen.

Following the results of previous isotopic research on Pacific Northwest salmon, I hypothesize that average bone collagen δ13C values will be higher than muscle tissue and average bone collagen δ15N values will be lower than muscle tissue due to physiological fractionation effects that differentially routes dietary isotopes during tissue formation (Misarti, 2007, Gannes et al., 1997, Schoeninger and DeNiro, 1984).

Bone collagen is typically composed of isotopes reflecting of protein isotopic composition rather than bulk dietary isotopic composition, bone collagen should comprise isotopic dietary inputs from earlier periods in the salmon's life (Gannes et al., 1997; Tieszen et al., 1983).

Measuring the physiological fractionation between bone collagen and muscle tissue will provide the comparative data necessary for dietary reconstructions that incorporate archaeological bone collagen from central Alaskan Chinook salmon and improve our understanding of physiological fractionation in salmonids.

Methods

SECTION

Fermentation of fish specimens

PARAGRAPH

The eleven Chinook salmon analyzed in this study were collected from the Salcha River close to Fairbanks, Alaska in the summer of 2015 with permission from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (Fig. 1, Fish Resource Permit # SF2015-209).

After size and sex data were recorded (Table A.1), each salmon was immediately gutted and frozen whole.

From each fish, ca. 1 g of raw, untreated muscle tissue was removed and lyophilized, or freeze-dried, at this stage.

PARAGRAPH

Previously frozen muscle tissue from each salmon was sub-sampled in ca. 75 g portions and fermented underground north of Fairbanks, Alaska following methods related to season, duration, and materials detailed in relevant ethnographic and historic sources from across the Subarctic (Table 1).

To keep small tissue samples intact during the fermentation process, sub-samples were wrapped in birch bark, a typical organic aid the Subarctic.

The samples were then placed in individual 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm-deep holes in a sandy loam on an eastern-facing hillside abundant in birch (Fig. 2).

Ethnographic sources commonly cite a minimum fermentation period of two weeks beginning in late summer or early autumn.

Following this protocol, samples were covered with ca. 5 cm of loose sandy loam and left to ferment for 17 days during late August.

While samples were fermented, the average daily temperature was 13 °C, the temperature did not fall below 2 °C, and it rained on 10 of 14 the days the salmon were buried (Wendler, 2018).

None of the tissue samples were disturbed during the fermentation process.

After 17 days, the fermented samples were exhumed and immediately frozen.

From these frozen fermented samples, approximately 1 g of muscle tissue was lyophilized.

SECTION

Collagen extraction

PARAGRAPH

Collagen extraction followed standard protocols (DeNiro and Epstein, 1981; Bocherens et al., 1991).

Two vertebral samples from each salmon were cleaned of muscle tissue with forceps, then crushed and sonicated in distilled water to remove remaining muscle tissue.

After the bone fragments had dried, 0.5 M HCl was added and samples were placed on a rocking table at room temperature for 48 h. Samples were repeatedly rinsed with distilled water and centrifuged until they reached a neutral pH, and subsequently placed in 0.125 M NaOH for 24 h.

After repeated rinsing with distilled water and centrifugation, samples were then immersed into 10−3 M HCl and transferred to glass vials.

To solubilize the solution, samples were placed in a 95 °C oven for 4 h, after which 100 μL 1 M HCl was added and samples were returned to a 95 °C oven for an additional 4 h.

The solubilized solution was centrifuged at 5000 rpm and the supernatant was lyophilized.

SECTION

Analyzed fractions

PARAGRAPH

Following fermentation or collagen extraction, 53 lyophilized muscle tissue and bone collagen sub-samples each weighing approximately 600 μg were submitted to the Stable Isotope Facility at the University of California-Davis.

For each sample, δ13C and δ15N isotopic values were measured using a PDZ Europa ANCA-GSL elemental analyzer interfaced to a continuous flow PDZ Europa 20-20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer.

These samples were run against four USGS laboratory standards calibrated against NIST Standard Reference Materials.

Carbon values are reported in delta notation parts per thousand (‰) relative to VPDB (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite) and nitrogen values are reported relative to atmospheric N2.

Analysis against four laboratory standards yielded an average standard deviation of ±0.05‰ for δ15N and ±0.04‰ for δ13C with one standard deviation around the mean and a standard error of <0.01 for both isotopes.

Based on these data, overall precision was better than 0.10‰ for δ15N and 0.09‰ for δ13C.

Results

SECTION

Effects of fermentation

PARAGRAPH

The average carbon and nitrogen isotopic values for fermented and raw muscle tissue are presented in Table 2, and complete results can be found in Appendix Table A.1.

An unpaired t-test was conducted to compare isotopic composition in treated (fermented) and untreated (raw) salmon muscle tissue samples.

The results show that fermentation is associated with significant average decrease in average carbon isotopic values (−1.5‰) and an increase nitrogen isotopic values (+1.3‰; Table 2).

PARAGRAPH

An unpaired t-test was conducted to compare carbon and nitrogen values in fermented and raw salmon muscle tissue samples.

This test confirmed that fermentation had an extremely significant effect on both carbon and nitrogen isotopic values (p < 0.0001; Figs. 3, 4).

Average variation within individual salmon was much less than the variation between treatments, though average individual variation was greater for δ13C values than δ15N values (Table 2).

The results show that fermentation had a significant effect on the isotopic composition of the sampled salmon tissue.

PARAGRAPH

The isotopic differences between raw and fermented salmon are consistent with the expectations for isotopic variation associated with the biochemical reactions that produce fermented foods (Section 1.4).

Fermented samples exhibited higher nitrogen values on average than raw samples.

This is consistent with previous isotopic studies of plant fermentation that have shown that the off-gassing of ammonia and other nitrogenous gases is associated with the release of lighter nitrogen isotopes and higher average δ15N values in fermented foods (Tolstikhin and Marty, 1998; Delwiche and Steyn, 1970).

PARAGRAPH

An average decrease in δ13C values likely owes to the lactic acid produced during fermentation.

Lactic acid bacteria typically found within fish likely incorporated carbon from surrounding sources indiscriminately to produce lactic acid (Leroy and De Vuyst, 2004).

The introduction of lighter carbon isotopes from soil or birch bark during fermentation likely accounts for overall lower δ13C values (Ehleringer et al., 2000).

The standard deviation for fermented δ13C values was over three times as great (SD = 1.3‰) as unfermented samples (SD = 0.3‰) with one standard deviation around the mean.

This also suggests that carbon was incorporated indiscriminately from surrounding organic sources (i.e., salmon tissue, soil, birch bark) during the bacterial production of lactic acid in the fermented tissue.

In sum, the results demonstrate significant isotopic differences associated with fermentation both average carbon (−1.5‰) and nitrogen (+1.3‰) isotopic values consistent with expectations for isotopic effects associated with fermentation.

SECTION

Bone collagen

PARAGRAPH

The carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition of salmon bone collagen and raw muscle tissues are presented in Table 3.

An unpaired t-test was conducted to compare the isotopic composition in bone collagen and raw muscle.

The results show that bone collagen has significantly higher average δ13C values than raw muscle (+3.3‰, p < 0.0001) but no significant fractionation in average δ15N values from these two tissue substrates (Figs. 3, 4).

Interestingly, average isotopic results in nitrogen also showed much tighter standard deviations than carbon (Table 3), further indicating that no significant physiological fractionation exists in nitrogen values.

The results show a physiological fractionation in bone collagen carbon isotopic values that is consistent with previous research on salmon, but no statistical difference in δ15N isotopic composition.

PARAGRAPH

Previous research on salmon bone collagen and muscle tissues has documented significant physiological fractionation in both carbon and nitrogen isotopes (Misarti, 2007: Appendix A).

While this study reflects similar δ13C results to previous research on Pacific salmonids, the salmon sampled here do not demonstrate a significant difference in the nitrogen composition of muscle tissue and bone collagen (Fig. 5) suggesting that nitrogen is not differentially routed during the formation of these two tissue types.

The small sample size (n = 7) and disparate populations sampled in the original study (Misarti, 2007) may have led to equivocal results on the physiological fractionation of nitrogen in salmonids.

The difference in nitrogen values reported on the first study is characterized by a large standard deviation in bone collagen nitrogen values (SD = 0.73‰; Fig. 5).

Further, an unpaired t-test confirmed that the difference between nitrogen composition in sockeye bone collagen and muscle tissue reported the original study is not quite statistically significant (p = 0.06; Misarti, 2007: Appendix A).

In contrast, the results presented here draw from a large sample size (n = 20) from one cohort of salmon, and thus this study's conclusions are likely less ambiguous than the previous study.

PARAGRAPH

The results from this study are consistent with previous comprehensive studies that considered mammalian isotopic routing and showed no fractionation of nitrogen between bone collagen and muscle tissue (Koch, 1994).

The results presented here may also be the result of the catabolic process that occurs when salmon cease feeding during their inland spawning migration (Kadri et al., 1995).

Additional research on Pacific salmonids is necessary to characterize the physiological fractionation of nitrogen isotopes, but this study does verify the consistent physiological fractionation of carbon isotopes in bone collagen and muscle tissue that previous studies have reported.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The first aim of this study was to measure the isotopic effects of fermentation in central Alaskan salmon.

The results demonstrate that fermentation has a significant isotopic effect on average δ13C (−1.5‰) and δ15N (+1.3‰) values in muscle tissue.

Two chemical reactions central to the fermentation process likely produced this measurable effect: the generation of carbon-based lactic acid and the off-gassing of nitrogenous volatiles.

These results suggest that lighter nitrogen isotopes are typically off-gassed in the form of ammonia and other volatiles, while carbon is indiscriminately incorporated from available organic sources, including lighter carbon isotopes from the soil and birch bark found in the fermentation pit.

This explanation is borne out in the high standard deviation across δ13C values from fermented tissue and the relatively low standard deviation in δ15N values and is further supported by previous isotopic research on plants (Tolstikhin and Marty, 1998; Delwiche and Steyn, 1970).

PARAGRAPH

This research presents preliminary evidence for an isotopic effect associated with fermentation, but future laboratory, ethnographic, and archaeological research would provide a more nuanced understanding of the isotopic effects of fermentation.

Studies in sterile laboratory conditions could measure the isotopic composition of the lactic acid and volatiles that are produced during the fermentation process and identify the specific bacteria involved in the putrefaction of samples.

Additionally, this preliminary study did not explore the isotopic effects of fermentation at different durations, which may have a scalar effect, or with alternative ethnographic methods, such as seal poke fermentation (Frink and Giordano, 2015).

Finally, fermentation may produce different isotopic effects in other animal species.

Future studies are necessary to further characterize the causal isotopic effects of fermentation following diverse methods in a range of dietary items.

PARAGRAPH

The second aim of this study was to measure the physiological fractionation in bone collagen and raw muscle tissue in central Alaskan Chinook salmon to refine isotopic data employed in dietary mixing models.

The results show that average bone collagen δ13C values are higher than raw muscle values (+3.3‰), which is consistent with average differences between bone collagen and muscle tissue reported in previous research on sockeye salmon (+ 3.0‰; Misarti, 2007).

However, in contrast to previous isotopic research on fish, the isotopic results presented here demonstrate no difference in δ15N values (Misarti, 2007; Sholto-Douglas et al., 1991).

Instead, these results resemble previous research on other animals that demonstrated no significant nitrogen fractionation associated with isotopic routing (Koch, 1994).

These results may also be related to the catabolic process that salmon undergo during their migration (Kadri et al., 1995; Gannes et al., 1997).

Additional isotopic research on salmonids is needed to characterize the physiological fractionation of nitrogen isotopes in bone collagen and muscle tissue in fish and to explain the differential routing of nitrogen isotopes, if verified.

Such research could refine standard offsets used in archaeological dietary reconstructions in this region and improve our understanding of behavior and diet throughout Arctic antiquity.

PARAGRAPH

This study provides the first evidence that archaeologists may be able to identify fermentation isotopically in either preserved human bone collagen or soil features related to fermentation.

However, additional research is needed to determine whether the significant isotopic effect demonstrated here is meaningful enough to incorporate into archaeological dietary studies.

Research that demonstrates the isotopic effect of eating different quantities of fermented foods in model organisms, such as pigs, could be applied to dietary mixing models in archaeological contexts (Warinner and Tuross, 2009).

Additional research that assesses isotopic differences in different foods or with different fermentation bacteria could further refine isotopic dietary reconstructions.

The results of this study demonstrate that fermentation is isotopically identifiable and future research could determine whether the isotopic effect of fermentation can be identified isotopically in archaeological materials.

This study highlights the value of considering diverse food processing techniques in archaeological research and reemphasizes the importance of employing comprehensive isotopic profiles of local dietary items in archaeological dietary reconstructions.

Conclusion

PARAGRAPH

The data presented here demonstrate that fermentation has a significant effect on both carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition.

Fermentation was associated with a significant decrease in δ13C values (−1.5‰) and a significant increase in δ15N values (+1.3‰) in the Chinook salmon muscle tissue sampled here.

The constituent biochemical processes of fermentation (lactic acid accumulation, off-gassing of nitrogenous volatiles) provide the most parsimonious explanation for this isotopic effect.

The results of this study have potential implications for dietary reconstructions on archaeological remains in the Arctic and Subarctic where fish fermentation remains an important cooking technique to this date.

PARAGRAPH

This study also provides information on the physiological fractionation in muscle tissue and bone collagen in spawning Chinook salmon that can be employed in future archaeological research in the region.

On average, bone collagen has higher δ13C values (+3.3‰) than raw muscle, but the results show no significant physiological fractionation in nitrogen isotopes.

This study provides much-needed isotopic profiles from central Alaskan salmon bone collagen and muscle tissues that can be applied to ongoing and future archaeological research concerned with the antiquity of salmon fishing.

PARAGRAPH

These results, while focused on one ethnographically-derived fermentation technique applied to a single cohort of migrating central Alaskan Chinook salmon, present compelling evidence for the effects of fermentation on fish and reveal several directions for future research.

Archaeologists have yet to consider the isotopic effects of fermentation and this study shows that this may be an important component of archaeological dietary reconstructions.

These initial findings suggest that future isotopic research centered on salmon and fermentation will contribute to a refined understanding of diachronic change in Arctic subsistence that can be compared to other regions around the world.

Additional isotopic studies that incorporate fermentation that could improve our understanding of human behavior in the Arctic and beyond.
