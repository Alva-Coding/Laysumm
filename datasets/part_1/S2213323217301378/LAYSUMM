Seizures in HIV: The case for special consideration

PARAGRAPH

In a study of 604 people living with HIV (PLWH), it was found that these individuals are more likely to suffer from seizures or epileptic fits than the general population.

Seizure treatment in PLWH was not always effective, possibly because of the drug interactions between anti-HIV medicines commonly known as antiretroviral therapy (ART) and anti-seizure drugs (ASDs), which can lead to low bloodstream levels of ASDs.

PLWH were also more likely to disengage from the hospitalâ€™s neurology services.

The ASD prescription and the provision of supplementary support services needs to be carefully considered for PLWH presenting with seizures.
