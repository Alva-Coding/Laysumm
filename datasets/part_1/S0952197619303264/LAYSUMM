TITLE

A fitting model based intuitionistic fuzzy rough feature selection

PARAGRAPH

Feature subset selection is an essential machine learning approach aimed at the process of dimensionality reduction of the input space.

The fuzzy set and the rough set are two different but complementary theories that apply the fuzzy rough dependency as a criterion for performing feature selection.

However, this concept can only maintain a maximal dependency function.

It cannot fit a particular data set well.

Therefore, in the current study, a novel intuitionistic fuzzy rough set model is proposed that fits the data well and prevents misclassification.

Firstly, intuitionistic fuzzy decision of a sample is introduced using neighborhood concept.

Then, intuitionistic fuzzy lower and upper approximations are constructed using intuitionistic fuzzy decision and parameterized intuitionistic fuzzy granule.

Furthermore, a new dependency function is established.

Moreover, a greedy forward algorithm is given using the proposed concept to calculate reduct set.

From the experimental results, it can be observed that the proposed model provides more accurate reduct set than existing model.
