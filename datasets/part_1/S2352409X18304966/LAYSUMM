TITLE

Deciphering Neolithic activities from a Cardial burial site (Cova Bonica) on the western Mediterranean coast

PARAGRAPH

Cova Bonica has yielded one of the few assemblages of Cardial Neolithic records of directly dated human remains (5470 and 5220 yr.

cal.

BC) in the Iberian Peninsula.

A minimum of seven individuals have been ascribed on the basis of the disarticulated human bones.

The paper concludes that the funerary and ritualistic practices of the Cardial Neolithic are difficult to reconstruct because human remains are often scattered in archaeological layers where other activities may also have been conducted.

Only a multi-proxy analysis of the archaeological material is capable of evaluating different processes and their associated activities.
