TITLE

Deciphering Neolithic activities from a Cardial burial site (Cova Bonica) on the western Mediterranean coast

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

The transition from hunter-gatherer to farmer populations meant radical economic and social changes from the ways of nomadism to more sedentary ways of life (Guilaine, 2013).

According to palaeogenetic data (Gamba et al., 2014; Olalde et al., 2015; Rivollat et al., 2015), farming appears to have been introduced into central and western Europe around 8000 years ago by new migrant populations, while the archaeological evidence suggests at least two distinct, but well-defined, migration routes: up the Danube valley and along the Mediterranean shoreline (Cruz Berrocal, 2012; Guilaine, 2013; Zilhão, 2001).

The Neolithic period in the associated archaeological sites shares close links with the Linearbandkeramik (LBK) culture in central Europe and with the Impressa and Cardial traditions in southern Europe, characterized by the domestication of plants and animals, and the use of a new lithic technology and raw materials, among other features.

Scholars have employed a range of approaches in their study of Neolithic phenomena in Europe, including, the determination of the rhythms of this process, radiocarbon dating, stratigraphy, and analyses of the social structure, economy, funerary practices, etc. (Bickle and Whittle, 2013; Binder, 2000; Bogaard, 2004; Cruz Berrocal, 2012; Davison et al., 2006; Gronenborn, 1999; Oross and Bánffy, 2009).

PARAGRAPH

Identifying the funerary practices of these cultures is of particular value as they are a good reflection of associated social behavior, providing us with insights into these past societies.

The study of the early Neolithic in Europe should enable us to establish, and distinguish between, the funerary patterns of each specific area (LBK, Cardial, Impressa, etc.) and between the latter and those of the Near East.

Archaeological evidence of the treatment of the dead in central Europe is well defined and suggests there was much uniformity throughout the LBK world.

At least three funerary patterns have been recorded in the LBK/Rubané groups (Jeunesse, 1996): a) isolated burials in pits associated with living areas; b) small groups of burials associated with living areas; and, c) isolated necropolises.

Skeletons were often buried individually, with corpses in the left decubitus position, while the most common grave goods were bracelets and Spondylus shell-beads, polished adze blades and beads made from a range of different raw materials (Jeunesse, 2003).

A differentiation between male and female burials has been suggested based on the grave goods recorded in the sepultures.

Additionally, many corpses were sprinkled in ochre and data from the Herxheim site (Palatine, Germany) (Boulestin et al., 2009; Zeeb-Lanz et al., 2009) and other synchronous sites demonstrate that violence and cannibalism were not rare (Jeunesse et al., 2014; Meyer et al., 2015).

PARAGRAPH

These well-defined funerary patterns differ from those of the early Neolithic in the western Mediterranean area.

Although some funerary structures (pits, graves and individualized sepultures) have been documented, inferences concerning mortuary rituals or practices from Impressa and Cardial horizons are not easy because human bones usually occur non-articulated and scattered in the archaeological layers of caves and rock-shelters together with artifacts from other activities.

Indeed, this archaeological record may be related to practices in which corpses were not actually buried but were left to rot in caves or rock-shelters, with an absence of negative structures, that is, the creation of an artificial place to serve as a grave and the covering of the corpse with the removed sediment, or alternatively corpses may have been interred by disturbing and moving previously buried skeletons.

As a result, human remains are commonly found commingled with archaeological artifacts (animal bones, lithics, charcoal, etc.), making it difficult to distinguish between grave goods and functional or domestic artifacts.

In fact, at many sites – including Abri de Jean Cros (Guilaine, 1979), Cova de Can Sadurní (Blasco et al., 2012) and Cova de l'Or (García Borja et al., 2011) – a large number of Cardial human remains are associated with domestic waste.

Less frequently, human remains are covered by blocks, as occurs at Grotte d'Unang (Paccard, 1987) and l'Abri de Pendimoun (Binder et al., 1993), with primary inhumations being rare (Utrilla et al., 2008; Zemour et al., 2017).

PARAGRAPH

The Cova Bonica site, located in the NE of the Iberian Peninsula, has yielded a rich assemblage of Cardial Neolithic human bones dated between c.5470 and 5220 years cal.

BC.

The site is a rare example of Cardial Neolithic funerary contexts in the Iberian Peninsula and one of very few in the western Mediterranean area in which Cardial human remains have been directly dated and associated with archaeological artifacts excavated in the last 20 years.

Moreover, the recent publication of the complete genome of a Cova Bonica human has renewed interest in the cave.

This genetic material constitutes the first complete genome of an Iberian farmer and also the first ancient genome to be reconstructed in the entire Mediterranean area (Olalde et al., 2015).

PARAGRAPH

The objective of this paper is to reconstruct the history of Cova Bonica based on the archaeological materials recovered and, more specifically, to infer the funerary practices conducted during the Cardial Neolithic in the western Mediterranean area.

Here, we used detailed excavation procedures, combined with a multi-proxy analysis of the assemblage, focusing on the anthropological remains, lithics and bone tool use, faunal and botanical remains, radiocarbon dating and spatial distribution, to explore the association between human corpses and other archaeological artifacts.

This study was conducted in cave layers IV-IV2, where the human remains were found, and it provides an opportunity to identify the events that occurred at the site and to examine the use of the cave during the Cardial Neolithic period, i.e. when the corpses were deposited.

SECTION

Site description

PARAGRAPH

Cova Bonica lies in the Garraf Massif (Vallirana municipality), some 30 km south of the city of Barcelona (41°22′10.29”N, 1°53′38.64″E) and 402 m asl (Fig. 1.1 and 1.2).

The site, frequently visited during the 19th and 20th centuries by members of the Centre Excursionista de Catalunya (Fig. 1.3 and 1.5), was first excavated in 1936 under the direction of the archaeologist J. de C. Serra-Ràfols; however, his team did not publish any results.

Later studies of the materials recovered during this fieldwork, and preserved in the Museu d'Arqueologia de Catalunya (MAC), focused on the pottery assemblage (Baldellou, 1974; Petit, 1985).

The site was furtively excavated during the eighties by J. Aznar.

Current archaeological work was initiated in 2008 by the Grup de Recerca del Quaternari (GRQ) (Barcelona University), which has described the site's human remains.

Indeed, the cave is one of very few sites with Cardial human remains in what is a secure chronological and stratigraphic context of the Iberian Peninsula.

Subsequent excavations at the site produced genetic (Olalde et al., 2015), pottery (Oms, 2014), and chronological (Martins et al., 2015) studies of the site (Oms et al., 2017) and of the materials recovered.

PARAGRAPH

The cave's original morphology and its speleothem formations were modified as a result of sparry calcite (dogtooth spar crystals) mining, while the cave's sediments were partially destroyed by earthmoving and mushroom farming during the fifties and sixties (Olalde et al., 2015; Oms, 2014) (Fig. 1.3 to 1.8).

The site consists of a principal chamber (SP) and two smaller, lateral chambers to the right of the SP, one next to the entrance (SL1) and the other in the inner area (SL2) (Figs. 1–2).

The area directly in front of the cave is occupied by a small terrace (40 m2), corresponding to the cave sediment infill, exposed by the erosion attributable to slope retreat and sealed by slope deposit.

Ongoing archaeological excavations, initiated in 2008, involve the cleaning of the rubble produced by mining activities, the excavation of the preserved remnants in the cave and the digging of a test-pit in the terrace.

PARAGRAPH

Only two remnant areas (Fig. 1.6) of the original Cardial infillings (layers IV and IV2) have been preserved following mining activities in the excavated area: one corresponds to a surface area of 11 m2 in SL1 (layer IV) and the other to an area of 7 m2 in SP-Graó 1 (layer IV2).

The test-pit dug in the terrace and the other areas excavated present no preserved Cardial layers.

Materials and methods

SECTION

Excavation methods

PARAGRAPH

Current fieldwork at Cova Bonica involves the excavation of 57 of the 230 m2 occupied by the site, corresponding primarily to the cave's northern sparry calcite mine (Fig. 2.2).

Part of the Holocene deposits were destroyed by mining and mushroom farming and, to date, only an area of ~18 m2 of anthropogenic deposits inside the cave has been identified.

Excavation was carried out using the standard archaeological methodology, with the three-dimensional plotting of finds.

Remains were mapped in situ prior to removal, while small fragments were bagged by 1-m2 units of provenience.

Open-source software Quantum GIS (QGIS) was used to map the spatial distribution of finds.

PARAGRAPH

All sediments were processed by water flotation to recover small artifacts and sieved through 5-to-1 mm mesh screens.

Stratigraphic description is based on sediment texture, color, structure, stratigraphic boundaries, and the description of any cultural or biological materials present in the HG34, HL41, HK41, HG37, HH50 and HS32 profiles (Schoeneberger et al., 2002).

SECTION

Dating

PARAGRAPH

Twenty samples were selected for accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dating at the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit (Oxford, UK), the Beta Analytic Laboratory (Miami, USA) and the Centro Nacional de Aceleradores (Sevilla, Spain).

They were then calibrated using IntCal 13 curve (Reimer, 2013) and OxCal v4.3 software (Bronk Ramsey, 2009).

Samples were prepared at each laboratory following routine procedures to remove contaminants and obtain solid graphite samples for AMS measurement (Brock et al., 2010; Bronk Ramsey et al., 2004; Santos Arévalo et al., 2015).

PARAGRAPH

Fourteen samples were collected from the Cardial layers (layers IV, IV2, IV-EC1 and IVc).

Of these, five corresponded to human remains from layers IV2 (#6, #7, #8, #9) and IV (#4), seven to faunal remains from layer IV (#5) and IV2 (#10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15), one to a shell ornament from layer IV (#3) and one to a charcoal fragment recovered from the post-hole (#2).

The chronology is completed by additional dates from the archaeological layers that cap the Cardial layers IV2 (#17a, #17b, #18a, #18b) and IV (#16), and from the underlying layer V (#1).

Finally, two samples from human remains collected from the cave surfaces during the 1980s were dated (#19a/b and #20a/b).

The same software was used to perform a Bayesian analysis on layer IV2 (stratigraphic model per phase), in order to determine the homogeneity of the layer as a single phase.

SECTION

Human remains

PARAGRAPH

The osteological analysis involves the estimation of the minimum number of individuals (MNI), the demographic profile (age and sex) and the major traits of the population.

The remains were grouped into age clusters and labeled as CB (Cova Bonica) #1 to #6.

To estimate the MNI, we took into account each bone repetition and, in the case of paired bones, size was used to identify a different cluster.

PARAGRAPH

Age at death of immature specimens was estimated according to tooth eruption criteria (Crétot, 1978; Ubelaker, 1978), fusion of the epiphysis (Scheuer et al., 2000) and development of postcranial bones (López-Costas et al., 2012; Rissech and Black, 2007; Rissech and Malgosa, 2005; Rissech et al., 2008, 2013).

Tooth wear was used to determine the age of adults (Brothwell, 1987).

SECTION

Bioarchaeology record

SECTION

Faunal remains

PARAGRAPH

The zooarchaeological analysis of large mammal remains adhered to standard methods.

Taxonomic assignments, skeletal elements, portion of element according to side and age (infantile, juvenile, adult or senile) for the bone remains were determined (Reitz and Wing, 2008).

The non-identifiable fragments were assigned to broader anatomical categories in relation to skeletal tissue (e.g. flat, long or spongy bone) and body size categories (e.g. small, medium or large ungulates).

To evaluate the faunal assemblage, the number of remains (NR), the number of identified specimens (NISP) and the MNI indices were calculated for each taxon (Lyman, 2008; Poplin, 1981).

The criteria used to distinguish sheep and goats were in line with those employed by Payne (1985) and Zeder and Lapham (2010).

Taphonomic analyses focused on bone surface modifications and breakages and included identification of cut and gnaw marks, traces of burning and bone breakage patterns.

Although some bird remnants were present in the assemblage, they are not analyzed here.

PARAGRAPH

Palaeontological analyses to identify small-mammal species include the study of cranial and post-cranial elements: for Soricidae, mandibles and maxilla (Cuenca-Bescós et al., 2008; López-García, 2008; Reumer, 1984); for Chiroptera, mandibles, maxilla, isolated teeth and humeri (Bruijn and Rumke, 1974; Menu and Popelard, 1987; Sevilla, 1988); for Arvicolinae, the first lower molars (Cuenca-Bescós et al., 2008; van der Meulen, 1973); for Murinae, mandibles, maxilla and isolated teeth (Cuenca-Bescós et al., 2008; López-Garcia, 2008; Pasquier, 1974) and for Gliridae, mandibles, maxilla and isolated teeth (Cuenca-Bescós et al., 2009; Daams, 1981; López-García, 2008).

The taphonomic analysis of the small-mammal accumulations was conducted in order to differentiate between various activities.

SECTION

Charcoal

PARAGRAPH

The charcoal study is based on the analysis of 546 fragments collected by hand and bucket flotation using the traditional anthracological method (Chabal et al., 1999).

Identification of each fragment was conducted using an optical microscope (Olympus BX41) with dark and bright fields and 100x, 200x, 500x magnifications.

Each fragment was fractured by hand to observe the tree-wood anatomical structure that permits taxon identification.

Different taxonomic categories were used, including species, genus and family.

When differentiation was not possible, we used type or we regrouped the taxa: for example, Quercus sp. evergreen includes Quercus ilex, Quercus suber and Quercus coccifera and Pinus sylvestris type includes the mountain pine trees, Pinus uncinata, Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra, on the grounds of their similar wood anatomy cell structure.

To complete identification, we used a wood anatomy atlas (Schweingrüber, 1990).

Quantification was based on the number of fragments (the sum of remains collected both by hand and flotation).

SECTION

Microarchaeology: phytoliths, ash pseudomorphs and faecal spherulites

PARAGRAPH

A total of 16 samples were collected from different areas of the cave in order to analyze the following elements: phytoliths, ash pseudomorphs and faecal spherulites.

Phytoliths, silica microremains that formed in living plants, provide information about plant taxa and plant part provenience.

They can be found in soils and sediments as well as in association with any other archaeological remains in which plants were present.

Wood/bark and leaves of trees and bushes are rich in calcium oxalate crystals and when these plants burn (at temperatures between 400 and 500 °C), these crystals transform into a more stable calcitic phase in which their original shape is preserved – these mineral compounds are known as ash pseudomorphs (Brochier and Thinon, 2003; Franceschi and Horner, 1980; Franceschi and Nakata, 2005).

Finally, spherulites are calcitic aggregations formed within the digestive system of certain ruminants – specifically sheep, goats and cows – and are commonly found in their faeces (Canti, 1997, 1999; Portillo et al., 2012).

When identified, they are indicative of animal dung.

Both spherulites and ash pseudomorphs are well preserved in alkaline conditions (Canti, 1999; Gur-Arieh et al., 2014).

PARAGRAPH

Of the 16 samples analyzed, one corresponded to a post-hole (F14: #293); five were related to a possible fumier deposit (IVC: #353, #145, #303, #304 and #305); five corresponded to a whitish accumulation (EC3: #2622, #2629, #2630, #2621 and #2647); and, the last five samples were collected from the funerary area (IV2: #3653, #3654, #3655, #3229a and #3229b).

Phytolith extraction was conducted in line with Katz et al. (2010).

Between 20 and 50 mg of sediment were placed in a 0.5 ml Eppendorf tube and 50 μl of HCl 6 N was added.

On completion of the reaction, 450 μl of sodium polytungstate solution [Na6(H2W12O40)∙H2O] with a density of 2.4 g/ml was added.

The tube was vortexed and sonicated for 10 min and then centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm.

The supernatant liquid was removed and transferred to another tube.

Fifty microlitres of the aliquot was placed on a microscope slide and covered with a 24 × 24 mm cover-slip.

Morphological identification and counting of phytoliths was performed under the optical microscope (Olympus BX41) at 400× and 200×, respectively.

Morphological identification of phytoliths was based on our own modern reference collection (www.phytcore.org) as well as on that of the standard literature (Brown, 1984; Mulholland and Rapp Jr, 1992; Piperno, 2006; Twiss et al., 1969).

Wherever possible, the International Code for Phytolith Nomenclature (ICPN) was followed in naming the phytoliths (Madella et al., 2005).

PARAGRAPH

Ash pseudomorphs and faecal spherulites were analyzed in line with Canti (1997).

About 1 mg of dry sediment was placed on a microscope slide, prepared with Entellan New Merck and covered with a 21 × 21 cover-slip.

Both types of microremain were identified under cross-polarized light using an optical microscope (Olympus BX41).

SECTION

Archaeological artifacts

PARAGRAPH

The techno-functional analysis of the bone tools and the use-wear of lithics were both conducted using a binocular microscope Leica MZ16A (10×-90×), together with a metallographic microscope Leica DM2500 with an integrated Leica DFC camera in the case of bones and an Olympus BH2 (50× to 400×) equipped with a Canon 450D camera in the case of lithics (González and Ibáñez, 1994; Keeley, 1980).

PARAGRAPH

Morphological types and the raw materials used (shell, stone and coral) in ornamental objects were identified.

The technological procedures used in making the ornaments were studied using a binocular microscope (up to 80×) and their use-wear was observed to describe functionality.

PARAGRAPH

Pottery fragments were analyzed macroscopically.

Features such as color, texture, temper, decoration and technique were used to establish the minimum number of vessels.

This overall analysis also provided information on the forms and volumes of vessels (Bernabeu Aubán et al., 2012; Oms, 2014).

SECTION

Results

SECTION

Stratigraphy and chronology

PARAGRAPH

The lithological succession of Cova Bonica is represented primarily by five stratigraphic profiles (Fig. 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3), the cave sediments being preserved in the northern section thanks to the erosive processes associated with earlier mining activities.

Archaeological excavations have not been carried out between rope rows HF and GY in the cave's southern section (Fig. 2.2).

The stratigraphic profiles are located mainly within the cave; columns HK41 and HL41 are located in SL1; columns HG34 and HG37 are located in SP and HH50 corresponds to a unified profile of the excavation area located in the cave entrance and on the terrace (Fig. 2.3).

Profile HS32 is located in SL2 and corresponds to a mining shaft which presents a ~2-m stratigraphic profile.

The sediments preserved in the original stratigraphic position are scarce and correspond to an area occupying 11–14 m2 in SL1, ~7–19 m2 in SP and 4 m2 of the terrace.

PARAGRAPH

Twenty-seven layers identified during excavation were correlated across the different areas and profiles of the site.

These layers are referred to in this article using Roman numerals (I to XXVII), while Arabic numerals are used to group these layers into five episodes ranging from the Holocene to the Pleistocene; however, the bedrock was not reached during excavations (Supplementary Table 1).

Episodes 5 and 4 are composed of layers VI and V, respectively, and correspond to inner karstic sediments with well-developed flowstones.

They are located at the base of SP1 (profiles HL41 and HK41) and in the terrace area (HH50); both layers may correspond to an ancient phase prior to the ceiling collapse Episode 5 is located in SL1 and on the terrace and contains isolated palaeontological remains.

It alternates between phases of well-developed flowstones and endokarstic lutites (layer VI).

The same episode is located at a higher altitude in SL2 (HS32) and at the base of SP (HG34), probably signaling their presence across the entire cave at a time when its entrance was restricted.

Episode 4 is located in SL1 (layer V) and comprises cemented sediments that change laterally into soft sediments.

The uppermost part is hard-cemented and formed the speleothem bed floor of SL1 during the Neolithic.

Based on a date obtained for a charcoal fragment (Table 1 and Fig. 2.3 - Sample #1) (10.7–10.5 ka cal.

BP), Episode 4 corresponds to an Early Holocene deposit.

PARAGRAPH

Episode 3 corresponds to an early Neolithic horizon and is recorded only in the cave; however, it was eroded by sparry calcite mining, resulting in two small, separate remnants or areas, one located close to the entrance (SL1-layer IV) and the other in the principal chamber (SP-layer IV2).

The floor of SL1 is formed by the cemented Episode 4 (layer V).

Fourteen post-holes (labeled as F) have been identified in this episode and filled and covered by layer IV (Fig. 2.4 and 2.5).

Post-hole number 14 (labeled as F14) has been radiocarbon dated (Table 1 and Fig. 2.3- sample #2; 7.4–7.1 ka cal.

BP) and sealed by a 20-cm diameter combustion feature (labeled EC1) (samples #3 and #5; 7.1–6.9 ka cal.

BP).

The thickness of layer IV increases (2–4 cm) to the south (HK41) and the top of this layer (sub-layer IVc) corresponds to another slightly more recent burned area (sample #16; 6.9–6.7 ka cal.

BP), dated to the so-called Epicardial Neolithic.

The second remnant is exposed in SP (profile HG34) and separated by the discontinuity created by the mine.

The correlation between the two remnants is only tentative, as the distance between them is ~3.5 m. For this motive, the layer has been differentiated from layer IV and labeled as layer IV2 (samples #6 to #15; 7.4–7.1 ka cal.

BP); however, both layers contain the same archaeological artifacts.

This second layer lies in a depression formed by the cave's bedrock morphology and between large collapsed speleothems (layer XXVII).

In this area, an accumulation of ash has been detected and labeled as EC3.

At this stage of the study, Episode 3 is only preserved in SL1 and SP, that is, at a higher altitude than (the more recent) Episode 2, probably because the sediment was retained by the stalagmitic bedrock, which would have acted as a barrier.

PARAGRAPH

Episode 2, recorded in several areas of the cave, represents the earliest prehistoric phase of sedimentation, spanning from the late Neolithic to the Bronze Age.

A test pit excavated in the slope deposit preserved in the terrace (profile HH50) has documented a late Neolithic-Veraza horizon (layer XXIV) with some hundred vessel fragments.

The same cultural horizon has been identified in the sediments preserved after mine erosion in SP (layers XVIII, XIX and XX) and consists of mud sediments containing varying amounts of speleothems, bedrock limestone clasts and scant archaeological remains corresponding to the Bronze Age (Sample #19; layer XIX; 3.5–3.4 ka cal.

BP).

In profile HG34, Episode 2 (layer XIX2) overlies the early Neolithic facies (IV2) and contains abundant fragments of charcoal, scant pieces of late Neolithic pottery and faunal remains.

Two different facies can be identified: an upper level characterized by the accumulation of pottery fragments and a lower level characterized by an assemblage of micromammal bones.

From this early stratigraphic episode, the femur of an Ovis aries has been dated (Sample #18), yielding a range between 3.5 and 3.4 ka cal.

BP.

PARAGRAPH

The uppermost infilling of the stratigraphic sequence (Episode 1) corresponds to mixed sediments removed by mining (layer 0) and mushroom farming (sub-layer 0M) and contains prehistoric, Iberian-Roman, and Medieval-Modern ceramics as well as several Cardial artifacts.

Several human remains recovered from layer 0 of SL2 during the J. Aznar excavation and deposited at the Museu de Gavà have been dated (#19a/b–20a/b) to evaluate their relationship with the currently identified stratigraphy.

The reported ages suggest a more recent funerary phase hitherto unidentified at the site of the cave.

PARAGRAPH

Table 1 summarizes the radiocarbon measurements and the chemical data associated with the selected samples sorted according to the identification number (Id) used in this paper.

The Cardial human bones from layers IV (#4) and IV2 (#6, #7, #8, #9) present a good cluster of bone dates and their δ13C values are clearly indicative of a terrestrial diet.

A single Bayesian model is presented in Supplementary Fig. 1 (Indices = Amodel 107.7; Aoverall107.7), in which all the dates are treated as belonging to a single phase of activity or, at least, as being very close to each other in time, located between 5473 and 5345 cal BC (at 1σ) and 5516–5328 cal BC (at 2σ).

A t-test and chi-square test were also performed, confirming that they constitute a homogeneous set at the 95% confidence level (t-test = 2.5915; X2 = 9.49 at four degrees of freedom).

Six bone and teeth samples (#10–15) from faunal remains (goat or sheep), recovered from layer IV2, were processed in the CNA lab.

Samples were processed according to standard procedures for the extraction and purification of collagen, including ultrafiltration processes.

Five of the six samples presented similar results during sample preparation, and the organic material recovered was scarce, presenting an unusual foamy, sticky texture.

Thus, only one sample could finally be dated, although the quality of the bone was not entirely optimal.

Collagen yield was low at 0.65%, but the carbon content and the C/N ratio presented normal values (34% and 3.1, respectively).

However, given the low collagen content, and the problems identified during the pretreatment process of the other five samples, the results for sample 12 should be treated with caution.

SECTION

Spatial distribution

PARAGRAPH

Archaeological remains are present at varying densities in Cardial areas (IV2 and IV of SL1), though the density inside the cave is greater (IV2).

In this area the remains tend to accumulate, filling the depression as a direct result of the cave floor topography (Fig. 3).

The density of remains decreases progressively the further they are from grid squares HI36/37.

Human bones are found primarily in this area and are, in fact, scarce in SL1.

Ornaments, lithics, pottery, bone tools and faunal remains are also found in both areas.

Post-holes have only been documented in SL1 (layer IV).

PARAGRAPH

Although the archaeological horizons are not readily distinguishable owing to the narrowness of the layers, i.e. just 10 cm in the case of IV2 and a mere 5 cm in that of IV, a number of differences were detected in the respective distributions of faunal and human bones, though not, however, in their general spatial distribution, but rather in their vertical location.

Indeed, it can be seen that both are quite well separated in section A–B (Fig. 3).

SECTION

Human remains

PARAGRAPH

A total of 315 human remains were analyzed.

No anatomical connections were documented and the remains were fragmented (Fig. 4).

However, all body regions are represented: limbs being the most abundant (NR = 143, 46%), including shaft and epiphysis fragments as well as carpal and tarsal bones, followed by axial (NR = 87, 28%) and cranial skeletons (NR = 57, 18%), of which 41 are isolated teeth.

Pelvic – 3% (NR = 9) – and shoulder structures – 2% (NR = 7) – are poorly preserved (Table 2).

PARAGRAPH

Based on MNI analysis, seven individuals were identified and sorted in six age clusters at death.

Cluster CB1 corresponds to two adults aged ~25–35 years old, CB2 to a 12–13 year old juvenile, and CB3, CB4, CB5 and CB6 correspond to four children aged 8–9, 4–5, 2.5–3 and 6–7 years old, respectively.

Age was determined in all seven cases by dentition and postcranial bones and the discriminant function was applied to clusters CB2, CB3, CB4, CB5 and CB6.

DNA analysis determined that the adults in cluster CB1 were, at least, two females (Olalde et al., 2015).

Of the 315 human remains, 149 have been assigned to different clusters.

CB1 is the best represented cluster (88/149), corresponding to two females aged between 25 and 35.

CB3 and CB4 are represented by 20 and 22 bones, respectively (19/149 and 22/149), CB5 by 11 bones (12/149), while the most underrepresented clusters are CB2 and CB6 with 6 and 2 bones, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

Pathologies are scarce in the assemblage, being observed only in the dentition.

Dental calculus was present in 34% of the isolated teeth (NR = 14/41) in the adult clusters CB1 and in CB2.

Dental enamel hypoplasia was recorded in one case (canine crown of CB6).

No defleshing marks, nor any traces of activity of rodents or small carnivores, were observed; only trampling marks were recorded.

Bioarchaeology

SECTION

Large mammals

PARAGRAPH

A total of 660 large mammal bones were analyzed from layers IV and IV2 (Table 3 and Supplementary Table 2).

The ovicaprines dominate the assemblage (NISP = 431, 65%) with an MNI of nine.

Large bovid is represented by eight remains and by a MNI of, at least, two juveniles.

Suids are represented by only five remains, but with a minimum of at least one adult and one juvenile, and the horse is identified by just one lower tooth corresponding to an adult.

A carnivore remain can be determined by the fragment of a limb epiphysis, but its fragmented nature means the species cannot be identified.

Finally, seven lagomorpha remains were recovered.

PARAGRAPH

Ovicaprines, the most abundant taxa in the assemblage, are represented mainly by axial (47% of ovicaprine remains), followed by limb (23%), distal limb (19%) and cranial elements (11%).

However, half these remains correspond to neonate specimens (age at death ≤1.5 months), represented mainly by complete skeletal elements.

Reflecting the abundance of ovicaprines, “small” is the predominant ungulate size class of the fragmented material.

PARAGRAPH

Taxonomic assignments were not possible, nor could we distinguish between wild and domesticated species in the assemblage, due to the fragmentation or scarcity of the samples.

However, it should be stressed that, in the case of ovicaprines, the fragmentation of adult remains does not provide reliable diagnostic features to distinguish goat (Capra hircus) from sheep (Ovis aries).

Having said that, the morphology of the decidual dentition (Payne, 1985), especially that of the lower dP3, is more similar to that of Ovis than that of Capra.

Moreover, it proved impossible to distinguish between wild and domesticated species of suid, large bovid and horse.

The osteometric data for the single, large bovid astragalus suggest the animal was larger than other domesticated bovids (Bos taurus) (Martín et al., 2009) but smaller than an auroch (Bos primigenius); thus, because of the sexual dimorphism, it is not possible to rule out the possibility of it having been a wild species, for example, Bos sp.

PARAGRAPH

Anthropogenic activity on the bones was documented, including various cut-marks (NR = 7) and, mainly, in the fresh fracture pattern presented by the material, with the exception of the ovicaprine neonates.

Burnt bones were present, showing different degrees of burning (NR = 42).

Gnawing damage inflicted by carnivores (NR = 6) and by rodents (NR = 3) were documented in a small number of remains.

SECTION

Small mammals

PARAGRAPH

The sample studied comprised a total of 1061 identifiable small-mammal remains, belonging to 555 individuals from at least 11 taxa, according to Bañuls-Cardona (2017): Crocidura russula, Myotis myotis-blythii, Myotis nattereri, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus euryale-mehelyi, Miniopterus schreibersii, Iberomys cabrerae, Microtus (Terricola) duodecimcostatus, Apodemus sylvaticus, Eliomys quercinus and Glis glis (Table 4).

PARAGRAPH

The most abundant species in the assemblage is Apodemus sylvaticus, representing 66.9% of the small mammals identified in this layer (Table 4).

The forest is the best represented environment with the presence of Apodemus sylvaticus (66.7%), Eliomys quercinus (11.7%) and Glis glis (0.4%).

Moreover, a high number of typical Mediterranean taxa, including Crocidura russula, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus euryale-mehelyi, Miniopterus schreibersii, Iberomys cabrerae and Microtus (Terricola) duodecimcostatus, have been identified (Bañuls-Cardona et al., 2017).

PARAGRAPH

The mandibles and isolated teeth of the rodent and insectivore remains present a slight degree of digestion (Table 4), suggesting that the accumulation of these small mammals in the cave might be attributed to a category 1 predator, that is, to a nocturnal bird of prey displaying an opportunistic trophic pattern and producing slight modifications of the bones it ingests (Andrews, 1990).

In contrast, the chiropteran bones present no modifications due to digestion, indicating that the Chiroptera were not accumulated by a predator but probably died a natural death (Table 4).

The large number of remains belonging to the same taxon, the case, for example, of Myotis myotis-blythii (11.35%) (Table 4), points to the presence of a hibernation colony, in which a majority of adult individuals died (Kowalski, 1995).

SECTION

Charcoal

PARAGRAPH

The anthracological record comprises largely similar values of Quercus sp. deciduous, Quercus sp. evergreen, Pinus halepensis and Arbutus unedo.

These taxa show values between 12 and 20% in both layers.

Pinus sylvestris type and Juniperus show higher values in layer IV2, where they are up to 6.9 and 11%, whereas in layer IV they only reach c. 2% (Table 5).

The rest of the taxa, present in only low values, correspond to small trees or shrubs.

A study of their respective ubiquity (presence/absence) patterns shows very similar results for both layers, the sole exceptions being Prunus and Fabaceae, which, while present in layer IV2, are absent from layer IV (Table 5).

The anthracological records of layers IV and IV2 are very similar, the most represented taxa corresponding to evergreen and deciduous oaks, Pinus halepensis and Arbutus unedo.

As such, the assemblage would appear to correspond to that of a mixed oak forest with small trees and a shrubby and liana component with Acer, Prunus, Erica, Rhamnus alaternus/Phillyrea, Hedera, Lonicera and Lamiaceae, among others.

Other heliophilous species such as pines and other shrubby vegetation with Rhamnus, Erica, Juniperus, might also have developed in open land areas.

Overall, the similarity of values presented by the most significant taxa might indicate that they correspond to the same assemblage.

The exceptions of the values presented by Pinus sylvestris type and Juniperus, however, might point to a difference in terms of the use of space.

SECTION

Microarchaeology: phytoliths, ash pseudomorphs and spherulites

PARAGRAPH

Phytoliths are scarce to absent in the record, whereas ash pseudomorphs and spherulites are present in all samples.

Of the 16 samples analyzed, only four presented enough phytoliths (>50) to be interpreted morphologically (Site #145, #303, #304 and #305 – from an ash accumulation corresponding to a possible fumier).

The concentrations of the remains analyzed are reported in Table 6.

PARAGRAPH

According to Gur-Arieh et al. (2014), the ratio between ash pseudomorphs and phytoliths (henceforth PSR) is an indication as to whether sediments are derived primarily from dung or from wood ash – that is, dung containing small amounts of ash pseudomorphs or wood not producing spherulites.

Thus, a PSR value higher than five indicates a predominantly wood ash composition, while a value near zero indicates the predominance of dung.

The results, reported in Table 6, show that four samples are unequivocally formed from wood ash (sample 145, which corresponds to the ash accumulation, and samples #2629, #2630 and #2621, which correspond to the whitish patch).

The rest of the samples are formed from dung.

Among the ash pseudomorphs, rhombohedral types, common in angiosperms such as oak, are the main morphotypes identified (Franceschi and Nakata, 2005).

PARAGRAPH

The main phytolith morphotypes recovered correspond to grasses, especially short cell rondels and trapeziforms from the C3 Pooideae subfamily, indicative of a temperate, humid climate (Brown, 1984; Piperno, 2006; Twiss, 1992; Twiss et al., 1969).

The phytolith characteristics of the inflorescence of this family, such as long-cell dendritics and echinate or epidermal papillae, are scarce in all samples from SL-IV.

PARAGRAPH

Although the ash pseudomorphs identified in all the samples indicate the presence of dicotyledonous plants, the presence of phytoliths is scant, represented primarily by wood and bark phytoliths.

This is not unexpected given that the wood and bark of dicotyledonous plants produce few or almost no phytoliths (Albert and Weiner, 2001; Tsartsidou et al., 2008).

Leaves, which produce a higher amount of identifiable phytoliths, have not been recovered though.

Archaeological artifacts

Bone tools

PARAGRAPH

Six bone tools were recovered from layer IV (site #509 –Fig. 5.3, #48 –Fig. 5.5, and #3) and IV2 (site #2392 –Fig. 5.1, #2914 –Fig. 5.2,– and #3568 –Fig. 5.6).

Of the three tools recovered from layer IV, two are fragmented awls and the third is the fragment of an awl or smoother.

Two of the fragments present marked heating alterations (site #48 –Fig. 5.5 and #63 –Fig. 5.4), and the third presents gnawing marks, possibly produced by a small carnivore (site #509 –Fig. 5.3).

All three items show signs of use.

The use-wear observed in the distal portion of the awl (site #509) could result from the working of an animal hide or leather (Fig. 5.2.

a–b).

Based on the degree of fragmentation, alteration by fire and use-wear, all of these objects appear to be associated with a domestic context.

PARAGRAPH

The three remains recovered from layer IV2 are relatively intact and present no significant depositional or taphnomic damage.

The first corresponds to a small, completely intact, awl (site #2392 –Fig. 5.1) made from an ovicaprid metapodial bone, presenting a calcite concretion almost over the entire surface.

Use-wear polishing can be observed in the distal tip, related possibly to the working of fresh clay during pottery making – to produce incisions or perforations (Maigrot, 2010; Gijn, 2006) (Fig. 5.1.

a,b,c).

Alternatively, the use-wear documented may correspond to its having been used in working with plant fibers with a strong siliceous component (Gates St-Pierre, 2007).

At the base of the tool traces of its having been gripped by hand, or of a leather handle, can also be observed (Gijn, 2006) (Fig. 5.1.

d).

PARAGRAPH

The second artifact is a cervid antler point (site #2914 –Fig. 5.2) that has been subject to very little taphonomic alteration.

An examination of its morpho-functional characteristics suggests it was the tip of a missile weapon (Hughes, 1998), the traces of use observed being associated with repeated impact with the ground and some specific impact against rock surfaces (Fig. 5.2.

a, b).

The third element is a flat object with smooth lateral bevels (site #3568 –Fig. 5.6) worked from an indeterminate bone support and covered with a calcite coating of taphonomic origin.

Its morphology suggests it is the functional end of a small spoon or spatula.

It presents a fracture in its narrowest part, possibly corresponding to the proximal end.

Small spoons or spatulas of this type are relatively common in the early Neolithic record, especially among the Cardial ware (Pascual Benito, 1998).

Macroscopic inspection (8×) of the artifact detected manufacturing marks: broad, rounded striations that are more evident in the narrow zone near the proximal fracture.

Additionally, the entire piece presents a visible polish.

Inspection at high magnification (50× to 200×) shows that polishing and other microscopic stigmas (such as striations) are attributable to the combination of the final steps in its manufacturing and a significant taphonomic alteration.

The alteration is manifest at a magnification of 100×/200×, revealing the polish as presenting a corroded appearance with very bright spots randomly distributed over the surface.

The artifact's characteristics make it impossible to infer its function based on the analysis of the use-wear traces.

SECTION

Lithics

PARAGRAPH

A total of 22 lithics were examined: 13 from layer IV and 9 from IV2.

The raw materials used in the manufacture of these instruments were identified as flint, quartz, jasper and rock crystal.

The state of preservation of the material impeded observation of use-wear traces in some of the tools studied.

However, the information we did extract is valuable for the contextual interpretation of both archaeological layers.

PARAGRAPH

Four lithics recovered from layer IV present use-wear traces related to various activities: a retouched flake has been used to scrape a dry hide, a geometric microlith appears to have been used as a projectile, a blade fragment shows traces of cereal harvesting, and a flake has been used to scrape an indeterminate or soft/semi-hard material.

The blade used for harvesting is of particular interest as it adheres to the hafting model employed to manufacture the first Neolithic sickles found in the Iberian Peninsula (Fig. 6).

Our research shows that the sickle implements are organized diagonally, with small aligned blades (Gibaja et al., 2014).

PARAGRAPH

In layer IV2, one trapezoid presents an impact fracture whereas the other samples – the two intact rock-crystal blades – present no traces of use (Fig. 6).

SECTION

Ornaments

PARAGRAPH

A total of 19 ornaments from layers IV and IV2 were studied (Fig. 7 & Supplementary Table 3).

Morphological typologies include marine gastropod pendants, circular shell beads, Dentalium vulgare beads, a perforated shell pendant, circular stone beads and a coral bead.

PARAGRAPH

Marine gastropod pendants were produced with Euspira catena and Columbella rustica (Fig. 7.7–13).

All specimens were perforated (creating a hole for suspension) with a lithic spike using combined percussion and pressing techniques.

These pendants present a pigmentation of red concretions.

PARAGRAPH

Circular shell beads were produced with Glycymeris sp. and Cardium sp. specimens.

The surfaces of the beads were polished by abrasion and then perforated centrally using a bipolar, concentric rotation technique.

The surface of the Cardium sp. bead retains its ribbed shell.

These beads also present a red-brown pigmentation of ochre or similar.

PARAGRAPH

The end of the Dentalium beads were deliberately fractured and polished so they could be inserted into a necklace or bracelet (Fig. 7.5–6).

The Glycymeris bimaculata shell pendant presents an apical perforation produced by abrasion and vertical parallel lines as a result of polishing (Fig. 7.7–13).

PARAGRAPH

Circular stone beads are grey/black with a central perforation (Fig. 7.2–3).

All surfaces and surroundings were polished by abrasive action, producing both parallel and multidirectional lines and leaving the footprint of a lithic tool used for the bipolar, biconical concentric perforation.

Use-wear evidence points to traces of rubbing along the edges of the piece.

PARAGRAPH

Finally, a spherical-globular bead of red coral was documented.

The piece is broken, and bears a central perforation in an abrasive plane, and a further three orifices, two in the same face (Fig. 7.1).

Perforations were produced by unipolar, biconical concentric rotation.

PARAGRAPH

In short, the ornamental objects recovered at Cova Bonica are representative of the typology and technology of such items from Ancient Neolithic archaeological sites between VI-V millennium BC in the NE of the Iberian Peninsula.

The presence of 11 fragments bearing a red-ochre pigmentation (site # 2549; 2587; 2792; 2815; 2902, 3142; 3204, 3206, 3209; 3326 –Fig. 7.17–24) appear to be associated with an intentional decorative use.

SECTION

Pottery

PARAGRAPH

The pottery record of layers IV and IV2 is very scarce (NR = 34 and NR = 121 respectively) (Fig. 8).

Fragments are small, ranging between 150 and 35 mm and no complete profiles have been recorded.

PARAGRAPH

In layer IV, the 34 fragments can be ascribed to a total of eight vessels.

Eleven fragments present morphological and/or decorative patterns.

The dark coloration of the fragments indicates they were fired in a reducing atmosphere (five of the eight vessels), there being a balance in the number of vessels receiving polished (4/8) and smoothed (4/8) surface treatments.

The few morphological features identifiable indicate that these vessels may have been spherical (3/8) and cylindrical (2/8), while the other three cannot be determined.

By typology, five vessels can be considered as having been medium-sized, two as large and one as small.

Only five of the vessels are decorated, three bear Cardial designs (one preserving its ochre pigmentation within the impression) and two present a plain horizontal cord.

The themes of the decorations are repetitive, the horizontal pattern being predominant with the exception of one piece which presents an angular “Tang” motif.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 121 potsherds were recovered from layer IV2.

The macroscopic analysis suggests a MNI of 28 ceramic vessels, 14 of which are decorated (50%).

The typological features are representative of classical early Neolithic morphologies: two bottles, six bowls, nine globular pots and four cylindrical storage pots.

The diameter index and the thickness of the potsherds points to the presence of two micro-vessels, five small vessels, two small to medium-sized, ten medium-sized, four medium to large, three large and two undetermined.

As regards decoration (14 vessels), the impression technique was predominantly used, accounting for 57.1% of the total (seven using the Cardial technique, and only one using a different impression technique), followed by relief molding (present in five pots, 35.7% of the sample) (Table 7).

The decorative patterns are quite plain, with only one Cardial double-technique (vessel 1) and another in which a Cardial impression and an incision are mixed.

The decorative themes of these Cardial Neolithic vessels are organized in well-defined horizontal bands.

Finally, seven vessels present ochre pigmentation, four of them with Cardial decorations.

SECTION

Discussion

SECTION

Coherence/consistency of the deposit based on its spatial distribution and chronology

PARAGRAPH

The Cardial Neolithic occupations of Cova Bonica present accumulations resulting from both natural and cultural processes (Table 8).

The record of the anthropogenic processes is documented in SL1 by the 14 post-holes, the combustion structure (EC1) and the burned area (IVc), and by the ash accumulation (EC3) in SP.

However, the archaeological materials recovered in association with these features do not present a sufficiently clear spatial distribution to determine the related anthropic activities.

PARAGRAPH

The anthropological study and spatial distribution of the remains indicate a clear relationship between layers IV2 (SP) and IV (SL1), with several human bones ascribed to the same individuals (the case of age clusters 1, 5 and 1 or 6) being recorded in both areas of the cave.

The greater accumulation of human remains in layer IV2 suggests that bodies were initially deposited in this area (or, at least, near this area) and were subsequently, and partially, displaced to SL1 after their skeletonization.

In short, the scattering of the human bones suggests that, if they do represent former burials, a post-depositional event or events dispersed the remains from their original location.

PARAGRAPH

Radiocarbon dating of the six human bones recovered in the two areas of the cave (layer IV and IV2) indicates that the remains formed an homogeneous assemblage.

Statistically, the results present the same radiocarbon age (mean pooled radiocarbon for five of the samples is 6393 ± 14 BP), giving a range that spans from 5321 to 5466 years cal.

BC (2σ).

Furthermore, data from the Bayesian analysis of the same bones suggest a relatively short or synchronic time-span for the deposition of the human corpses, in at least the three age clusters that have been dated.

PARAGRAPH

Human bones and faunal remains present a distinct pattern of distribution in the eastern sector of the SP-layer IV2.

Faunal remains are slightly separated and are found in a lower position than that of the human remains, suggesting they were formed by two sedimentation events.

However, this hypothesis cannot be sustained by the chronological results, as five of the six radiocarbon samples of the faunal bones from layer IV2 failed and one sample yielded <1% weight collagen causing the result to be rejected.

PARAGRAPH

The anthropic activities documented at Cova Bonica are concentrated in layer IV (SL1).

However, given the inaccuracy of the sample type, the radiocarbon dates obtained from this area hinder any accurate reconstruction of the timing of this deposition.

For example, the post-holes were filled by layer IV and the charcoal sample recovered from post-hole 14 gives statistically the same age; however, this sample is from a shrub tree that can live for decades or centuries and so we cannot rule out the possibility of the ‘old wood’ effect.

The radiocarbon age of the shell sample from layer IV matched this same time range, but again we cannot rule out a potentially biased result caused by the reservoir effect or the ‘old shell problem’ (Rick et al., 2005), that is, the use of old shells by humans to make beads and other artifacts, including shells collected from fossil deposits, older archaeological sites, and beaches.

Nevertheless, the radiocarbon result of the EC1-rubefacted deposit seems to corroborate the Cardial age of layer IV and the post-holes.

Our sample was taken from a short-lived sample (cf. Ovis scapula bone) obtained from a feature sealing post-hole 14.

As such, this sample seems to confirm that in terms of chronology the shepherds' activities post-dated the burial phase at Cova Bonica.

Furthermore, the dating of the second rubefacted area (EC3) is in accordance with the notion that intermittent, periodic herding activities were practiced in the Neolithic in the cave.

SECTION

Palaeoenvironment and landscape during the Cardial human occupations at Cova Bonica

PARAGRAPH

Mid-Holocene environmental conditions were a consequence of climate variations related mainly to changes in rainfall and fluctuations in aridity (Jalut et al., 2009; Pérez-Obiol et al., 2011).

These changes came to characterize a diverse landscape in terms of vegetation, in line with global climate conditions but also with specific biogeographical features (Carrión et al., 2010).

Thus, in NE Iberia, favorable temperate climate conditions during the early Holocene allowed the spread of deciduous oak; however, subsequent climate changes led to the retreat of deciduous forests in the mid-Holocene (Burjachs et al., 1997; Pérez-Obiol et al., 2011).

This period saw the development of mixed oak and evergreen oak forests and maquis shrubland at lower altitudes and in coastal areas (Allué et al., 2009; Carrión et al., 2010; Revelles, 2017; Riera and Esteban, 1994; Terradas et al., 2017).

Additionally, from the early Neolithic, the intensification of land use for crops, the exploitation of wood for building and fuel and more intense livestock practices combined to reshape vegetation cover (Allué et al., 2009; Revelles, 2017; Revelles et al., 2015; Riera and Esteban, 1994; Terradas et al., 2017).

PARAGRAPH

Palaeobotanical and micromammal studies conducted on the Cova Bonica's Cardial layers provide data about the palaeoenvironments and landscapes of the local vicinity.

The small-mammal assemblage identified is typical of the early Neolithic in the Iberian Peninsula: that is, it shows a high percentage of Apodemus sylvaticus (Bañuls-Cardona and López-García, 2009; Bañuls-Cardona et al., 2013; Cuenca-Bescós et al., 2008; Guillem-Calatayud, 1999; López-García et al., 2010, 2011).

Moreover, warm, wet climate conditions were documented in the Iberian Peninsula during this period (Tarroso et al., 2014), as evidenced by the high number of thermo-Mediterranean species (Crocidura russula, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus euryale-mehelyi, Miniopterus schreibersii, Iberomys cabrerae and Microtus (Terricola) duodecimcostatus) and, especially, the high percentage of Iberomys cabrerae (10.45%) (Table 4), in what are strictly Mediterranean taxa.

These taxa have also been identified at other Neolithic and Bronze Age sites in the Mediterranean region, including Cova de les Cendres (Guillem-Calatayud, 1999) and Cova Colomera (Bañuls-Cardona and López-García, 2009; López-García et al., 2010).

PARAGRAPH

The anthracological record provides data related to the vegetation cover and points to a an arboreal cover formed mainly from a mixed oak forest with small trees, combined with shrubby and liana components, consisting of Arbutus unedo, Acer, Prunus, Erica, Rhamnus alaternus/Phillyrea, Hedera and Lonicera, among others.

Other heliophilous species, such as Pinus halepensis, and other shrubby vegetation, such as Lamiaceae, Rhamnus, Erica, Juniperus, were also present with developing pines or open forests of shrubby vegetation.

Likewise, riverside forests and crop lands probably formed part of the landscape; however, the proxies used/available in this study did not allow us to identify them.

PARAGRAPH

The absence of any direct vestiges of human agriculture in Cova Bonica's palaeobotanical record is probably related to its distance (10 km) from the large plains that would have been suitable for farming.

The fact that the cave lies at the top of an escarpment and at the end of narrow valley does not allow us to speculate any further on the agricultural activity conducted in this area and as to whether Neolithic crops were well established in the region.

PARAGRAPH

Evidence regarding the Cardial vegetation from Cova Bonica is largely similar in the two areas of the cave (layers IV and IV2) in terms of the most significant taxa.

The two exceptions to this – the values presented by Pinus sylvestris and Juniperus – seem to point to a difference in human activities rather than to environmental change.

A comparison of the charcoal composition of layers IV and IV2 also reveals a slight difference in Juniperus and Pinus sylvestris type values.

However, the two taxa correspond generally to Pleistocene anthracological contexts (Badal et al., 2012) and evidence from early Neolithic sites in NE Iberia typically report values lower than 2% and only slightly greater than this at sites located at higher altitudes, such as Cova 120 (Molist et al., 2003).

Dating results of a Pinus sylvestris type fragment from layer IV2 at Cova Bonica indicates that it corresponds to the Neolithic.

Therefore, the presence of Pinus sylvestris type could correspond to the presence of this taxon in areas close to the site, but as a relict from the Pleistocene forests growing in colder environmental conditions or, alternatively, the remains could have been brought from higher altitudes for a specific purpose.

If located in a nearby area, this taxon could correspond to Pinus nigra, the mountain pine restricted to lower altitudes (Folch, 1986).

Moreover the presence of Pinus is related only to layers IV and IV2, being present in a single fragment in the middle and late Neolithic layers XIX, XVIII, XX (Allué et al., 2017).

PARAGRAPH

The open forest, or the development of shrubby vegetation, could point to anthropic disturbances related to agriculture or livestock management in the area.

Palynological and anthracological sequences show that deciduous oak trees spread from the early Holocene to form mixed forests during the early Neolithic in northern Iberia (Allué et al., 2009; Carrión et al., 2010; Piqué, 2005; Revelles et al., 2014, 2015, 2017; Ruiz-Alonso and Zapata, 2015).

In NE Iberia, in areas of lower humidity, deciduous oak grew together with sclerophyllous taxa forming mixed oak forests (Riera and Esteban, 1994; Allué et al., 2009; Revelles, 2017).

Anthropic markers can be identified from the early Neolithic in the archaeological, micropalaeontological and palynological sequences (López-Garcia et al., 2013; Revelles et al., 2015).

Evidence of Cerealia pollen and seed crops in various contexts is indicative of an early agricultural landscape.

Similarly, an increase in synanthropic taxa is evident in the case of some small-mammal assemblages, while livestock activities are indicative of forestry modifications (Euba et al., 2016; López-García et al., 2013).

At the Cova Bonica site, livestock activities probably affected the surrounding forests modifying their shape as animals consumed the trees' woody fodder.

The anthracological record from the late Neolithic at Cova Bonica indicates an increase in shrubby vegetation that might be a consequence of the intensification of human activities and the increase in aridity (Allué et al., 2017).

Sequences in nearby areas point to human activities related to slash-and-burn farming and other agricultural markers, including the presence of crop plants (Antolín and Buxó, 2011; Daura et al., 2016; Riera and Esteban, 1994).

Pinus halepensis and shrubby vegetation are usually pioneer species, growing after wild fires, and evidence of their presence at Cova Bonica might be related to such fire episodes or to slash-and-burn farming.

As such, this region was clearly occupied by human groups using and transforming the landscape in a mixed economy of agriculture and livestock breeding/herding.

PARAGRAPH

In short, the anthracological and micro-mammal assemblages reveal a typical Mediterranean landscape, comprising mixed oak forest formations growing under favorable conditions.

There would also have been a presence of pines and shrubby vegetation related to anthropogenic activity in the area.

These results are consistent with the general local and regional records provided by different proxies.

Additionally, the identification of phytoliths from the C3 Pooideae grass subfamily points to the presence of grasses that would have grown in association with the arboreal cover.

These particular grass types usually grow under temperate, humid conditions.

SECTION

The use of Cova Bonica as an animal pen

PARAGRAPH

The use of caves as animal pens is well documented among herder communities throughout the Mediterranean region during Prehistory.

A number of sites from the early Neolithic and Bronze Age present so-called fumier deposits associated with pen management This practice was intermittent and saw shepherds periodically burn piles of dung accumulated during previous visits so as to clean up the site and reduce the overall volume of dung.

The process generates a characteristic sequence comprising a bottom reddish layer, followed by a black sediment covered by a dark brownish layer.

The sequence is crowned by a white ashy layer, corresponding to the wood used to start the fire (Alonso-Eguíluz et al., 2017; Angelucci et al., 2009; Brochier, 1983; Fernández-Eraso and Polo Díaz, 2008; Polo Díaz et al., 2014; Vergès et al., 2016).

This being the case, ashy samples #145, #2629, #2630 and #2621, corresponding to layers IVc and EC3, may represent the wood combustion that started the fire.

PARAGRAPH

At Cova Bonica, although fumier deposits were not clearly identified during excavation, the post-zooarchaeological study, together with the identification of faecal spherulites in all samples, including those related to human remains, indicate the cave was used as a pen.

Unlike other caves, such as Cova de Can Sadurní, where a number of cereal seeds are indicative of activities related to agriculture (Antolín and Buxó, 2011), the absence of any such seeds seems to indicate that Cova Bonica was used as an animal pen for some period of time.

PARAGRAPH

At Cova Bonica, the large-mammal assemblage is dominated by ovicaprines.

Butchery activities are documented in these faunal remains, including adult ovicaprines, large bovid and undetermined large mammals (i.e. horse or large bovid).

Immature ovicaprines present complete bones and decidual teeth are mostly present in mandibles or maxillae, which rules out the replacement of dentition in the cave.

In the absence of anthropogenic marks, the intentional slaughtering of the infant class for dairy or meat by-products cannot be assumed.

The most plausible hypothesis would be that of the natural death of this class, due to high perinatal mortality (Hughes, 1998).

In line with this premise, the cave my well have been used as a sheepfold, while the palaeodemographic profile points to a high rate of mortality in the early stages of life.

Caution should be exercised regarding the presence of free-ranging caprid remains.

As cave dwellers, their presence may also be related to natural deaths, as documented in the case of the goat Myotragus, a predator-free fauna found in caves on the Balearic Islands (Ramis and Bover, 2001).

PARAGRAPH

Fodder management practices have been observed in caves used as pens (Euba et al., 2016).

Indicators of the use of woody species as fodder (leafy hay) include high values of certain taxa, such as Olea europea in Cova de les Cendres (Badal, 1999); Fraxinus in Abric de la Falguera (Carrión, 2005) and Quercus sp. deciduous and Fraxinus at several sites in northern and NE Iberia (Allué et al., 2009; Alonso-Eguíluz et al., 2017; Euba et al., 2016).

The mixed deciduous oak forest identified at Cova Bonica could have provided resources for a range of uses, including wood as a raw material for building or manufacturing objects, for food (acorns), as well as for fuel and fodder.

The management of these forests was probably a generalized practice among early agricultural communities (Euba et al., 2016; Ruiz-Alonso et al., 2017).

In line with the area's environmental conditions, the wood at Cova Bonica was probably employed in a range of diverse activities carried out in the cave.

For example, the presence of Buxus sempervirens, Maloideae, Prunus and Acer is scarce and could correspond to their use in manufacturing wooden objects or tools, given their excellent qualities for such purposes.

Examples of such objects made from these taxa are present at several other sites (Caruso and Piqué, 2014; López-Bultó, 2015; Picornell-Gelabert, 2012; Piqué, 1999; Terradas et al., 2017).

The detection of pine in layers IV and IV2 might correspond to specific purposes, such as it use for fence posts to pen in the livestock.

In short, the abundant presence of ovicaprines in layer IV2 and the presence of several combustion structures (EC1) and ash accumulations (EC3 and layer IVc) reinforce the hypothesis that the cave was used as a sheepfold.

The occurrence of faecal spherulites points unequivocally to the presence of animals at the site and, as such, Cova Bonica could have served as an animal pen during several periods.

Furthermore, the incidence of ash pseudomorphs indicates the occurrence of at least one burning episode.

Funerary practices at Cova Bonica during the early Neolithic

PARAGRAPH

The funerary practices of the Cardial Neolithic and later periods in the NE Iberian Peninsula are characterized by collective and individual burials in caves (Daura et al., 2015, 2017; Oms et al., 2017).

At Cova Bonica, at least seven individuals can be identified, pointing to a funerary use for this site by the territory's pastoral and agricultural communities.

The human remains, in part in secondary position, are commingled with scant, dispersed materials.

The scarcity of any valuable goods may reflect the use of perishable materials in the funerary practices (Antolín and Buxó, 2011; Solé et al., 2016; Vergès et al., 2016).

The use of the cave both as a funerary cache and as a sheep pen suggests that the site was used at different (i.e. not simultaneous) periods during the Cardial Neolithic, as documented in other deposits (Vergès et al., 2016).

The small-mammal remains recovered from layer IV2 may have accumulated when the cave was used for burials, that is, during periods in which few human activities were conducted in the cave.

For example, the absence of burnt bones is indicative that no animal husbandry was conducted within the cave, i.e. if animal dung was burnt the archaeo-palaeontological remains would present indications of this.

Finally, the high percentage of small-mammal remains in this layer, especially bat remains, points to a period during which the cave was abandoned by humans (Cuenca-Bescós et al., 2008).

PARAGRAPH

The ornamental objects recovered from Cova Bonica are similar to those found at other early Neolithic sites in the western Mediterranean area, where they seem to be associated with funerary levels both as burial goods and as domestic waste.

Indeed, the taxa employed at Cova Bonica appear frequently in the living layers of the region's open-air sites, including La Draga (Oliva, 2015) and Les Guixeres de Vilobí (Oms, 2014), and caves where funerary practices have not been documented (e.g. Cova de les Cendres).

Other sites include caves used for funerary purposes (García Borja et al., 2011): for example, Cova de Can Sadurní, located 3 km from Cova Bonica, presents ornamental objects associated with six Cardial inhumations (Blasco et al., 2012), while the open-air site of La Balance (c. 5100–4800 cal.

BC) presents an individual inhumation with 158 perforated shells (Columbella rustica) and 16 perforated red deer upper canines (Zemour et al., 2017).

Clearly, the use of jewelry pendants and ornamental objects as a proxy of funerary contexts is often problematic.

Indeed, current anthropological studies show that the functionality of shells and beads is very broad (Oliva, 2015), so that the parsimonious explanation for the Cova Bonica beads and perforated gastropods recovered from layers IV and IV2 is that they constituted either part of the grave goods or part of the clothing or jewelry of the deceased.

Grave goods may include a group of artifacts that were the possessions of the deceased, or they might represent the mourners' gifts to the dead, the commonest being clothing and related equipment and ornaments, containers and remains of food and drink (Pearson, 1999).

PARAGRAPH

The coral bead recovered at the site is the most ancient documented in the western Mediterranean basin, with coral beads only having been identified previously at Arene Candide (Italy), layer 25–26 dated around 5260–5025 cal BC (Borrello et al., 2012).

Coral ornaments in Iberia are usually documented later in the post-Cardial Neolithic (e.g. Can Tintorer) and the middle Neolithic funerary contexts (e.g. Bòbila Madurell and La Serreta).

PARAGRAPH

Any interpretation of the tools recovered from layer IV2, in association with human remains, is even more taxing.

In this assemblage, only one lithic tool presents clear evidence of use, whereas the other lithic tools appear unused, intact and in perfect condition (especially in the case of the two crystal rock bladelets).

These elements – unused artifacts and microliths – are common in other Neolithic graves from later periods in the region (Gibaja, 2003).

This suggests that they might well be grave goods that were deposited with the individuals buried in this layer.

In contrast with the lithics recovered from layer IV2, four of the 13 items recovered from layer IV had obviously been used, indicative as such of a domestic horizon.

Bone tools recovered from layer IV2 may also be burial goods, based on their completeness and relatively intact nature.

They appear to have been manufactured using quite elaborate techniques from hard animal tissue and their forms point to a considerable investment of both time and effort.

In contrast, the bone tools from layer IV seem to have been heavily used until broken and discarded, suggesting the presence of a variety of domestic activities.

PARAGRAPH

The pottery record from layers IV and IV2 is barely fragmented, a characteristic that might be related to various post-depositional factors.

The vessel features are very similar to those documented in other coetaneous domestic assemblages (Oms et al., 2017); however, an ochre-colored pigmentation observed in a few fragments and in, what are presumably, two micro-vessels could be related to funerary practices.

The use of red pigmentation is difficult to discern at Cova Bonica, although the presence of red colorant in Neolithic ceramics has been documented at archaeological sites used for other purposes (Bernabéu et al., 2008; Pradeau, 2015).

In addition to the ceramic fragments, red colorant is present at Cova Bonica in four ornaments and in the small ochre pieces themselves and, as such other uses cannot be ruled out.

PARAGRAPH

Direct evidence to interpret charcoal remains in funerary contexts is difficult to obtain, as the formation of the assemblage can be associated with fire remains in a number of different contexts, including fire for lighting, fire employed in funerary practices, fire for cleaning, etc. (García Puchol et al., 2010).

Indeed, the charcoal assemblage from Cova Bonica includes different taxa that might be related to specific practices carried out in the cave, one of which might be Neolithic funerary practices.

The higher values obtained for Pinus sylvestris in layer IV2 are significant in this regard and might be related to a specific purpose.

The Lamiaceae include a variety of aromatic species, such as Rosmarinus officinalis, Lavandula and Thymus.

Of these, we have only been able to identify R. officinalis, and only then at values below 1.5%, at Cova Bonica.

Their presence in the anthracological record is always scarce, but they would appear to have served a specific purpose.

In given contexts, the identification of taxa of this type has been associated with funerary practices: the flowering plant being used in the combustion process, presumably because of its aromatic properties (Picornell-Gelabert et al., 2012, 2018).

Similarly, Laurus nobilis has aromatic properties and is a valuable wood for manufacturing objects (Caruso and Piqué, 2014; Solé et al., 2016).

This species is scarce in the anthracological records of NE Iberia (Allué et al., 2009; Piqué, 2005; Ros, 1996).

A relative abundance has only been documented in specific cases, such as at La Draga, where it has been identified as being used for object manufacture and for fuel (Caruso and Piqué, 2014; Terradas et al., 2017).

According to Caruso and Piqué (2014), the abundance of Laurus nobilis at La Draga is related to its riverside location, and the site's proximity to a lake, a circumstance that has resulted in the greater use of this shrub.

In other sequences, its use might be related to the species' properties as its presence is either very low or related to specific burial practices such as protection or transportation, structures that would have eventually been burnt.

PARAGRAPH

In short, assessing which archaeological artifacts might have been associated and deposited with human corpses is far from straightforward.

The presence of human bones indicates that Cova Bonica was used for funerary purposes during periods in which other activities, such as animal husbandry, were probably not being practiced.

The results of the multi-proxy analysis reported here suggest that the following elements may well have been related to funerary practices: ornaments and beads, lithic remains, bone tools, ceramics and plants.

Conclusion

PARAGRAPH

The multi-proxy analysis conducted on layers IV and IV2 at Cova Bonica suggests that the cave was occupied during the early Neolithic, the so-called Cardial horizon.

Moreover, it indicates that at least two major activities were performed at the site.

First, the cave appears to have served primarily as a funerary cache.

The concentration of human remains in Cardial area IV2 suggests corpses were either deposited on the surface or within a decaying structure, given that no pits or other non-perishable structures have been documented.

Corpses appear to have been deposited during a relatively short time period extending between 5515 and 5328 cal BC (at 2σ).

The presence of small-mammal remains suggests that at some time during this sequence the cave was abandoned, a conclusion compatible with its funerary use.

Second, the presence of ovicaprine neonatal remains, together with spherulites, indicates that the cave is likely to have been used as a sheepfold.

However, it seems that the two activities were not coetaneous, as shown by the vertical distribution of materials recovered from layer IV2.

Unfortunately, the chronological framework could not be defined as the radiocarbon samples failed.

The cave appears also to have been used as a human shelter as indicated by the presence of cut-marked bones, and possible hearth remnants.

Yet, it is impossible to determine whether these sporadic occupancies were related to husbandry or funerary practices.

The post-holes documented in SL1 (layer IV) may have sustained one or multiple architectural elements, such as a hut or an enclosure, for indeterminate purposes, such as a resting area or for separating females and offspring from the herd.

The personal ornamentation recorded cannot be readily assigned to either the corpses, the human occupancies or the other perishable objects.

The most parsimonious explanation seems to be that different archaeological objects (various shell-beads, two intact crystal rock bladelets, two micro-vessels and ochre-coated pottery) were associated with the deceased.

PARAGRAPH

To understand early Neolithic burial practices in karstic cavities, archaeologists need to conduct exhaustive multi-proxy analyses of their data.

Here, the temporal resolution of archaeological cave occupations is critical, although the drawing of any behavioral inferences in relation to prehistoric communities from the intra-site spatial patterning is often problematic.

Large caves and rock-shelters attracted human populations, and were occupied for long periods during late prehistory and used for a range of different purposes that reflect changes in the lifestyle of Neolithic populations.

Cave users would have hunted animals and collected fruit in their immediate environs; domestic activities would have been carried out in what constituted the homes of farming communities; temporary refuge would have been provided to transhumant pastoralists; perishable goods could be stored in these places; and, corpses were buried in cave deposits.

Archaeological studies conducted in these deposits seek to reconstruct the often complex history of these caves, which were subject to successive episodes of occupation and abandonment.

The presence of personal ornamentation, animal bones, pottery and lithics commingled with human bones may be erroneously assigned to grave goods and to mortuary rituals.

Indeed, the presence of different materials in the same layer could be indicative of quite distinct events (successive or coetaneous) of quite different natures.

Ephemeral activities performed by Neolithic groups, as evidenced in these deposits, can only be detected by employing an exhaustive excavation methodology based on multi-proxy procedures capable of providing high-resolution data.

Associations between possible burial practices and archaeological artifacts are not readily intelligible when corpses are disarticulated and when graves or grave structures are absent.

Clearly, more in-depth analyses, in line with those reported herein at Cova Bonica, are needed to identify and evaluate the funerary practices of the western Mediterranean during the Cardial Neolithic period.
