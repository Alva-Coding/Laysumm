ABSTRACT

TITLE

The provenance of Kul Tepe obsidian artifacts: Syunik and the highlands of Armenia as possible seasonal pastureland

PARAGRAPH

Excavations at the site of Kul Tepe in the Jolfa region in north-western Iran have unearthed various archaeological materials from Late Neolithic/Early Chalcolithic to Achaemenid periods (end of 6th millennium to 3rd century BC).

During the Chalcolithic and the Bronze Age most lithic tools used in Kul Tepe were made of obsidian.

From the first and second excavation seasons, 53 and 32 obsidian samples were selected and analyzed by pXRF.

According to the results, the main source of obsidian for the workshops in Kul Tepe was Syunik, but other sources in the Lake Sevan Basin like Ghegam, Bazenk, Choraphor and Gutansar and the Lake Van region (Nemrut Dağ and Meydan Dağ) were utilized also.
