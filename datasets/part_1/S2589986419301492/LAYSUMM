TITLE

Seizure-induced thoracolumbar burst fractures â€“ not to be missed

PARAGRAPH

We report on two cases where thoracolumbar burst fractures were caused by seizure activity and missed due to confounding symptoms.

When burst fractures are missed and treatment delayed, there is a potential for neurological consequences.

This paper serves as another call for a high-degree of clinical suspicion when treating post-ictal patients to ensure they undergo a focused neurological examination of the lower extremities.

If unresponsive/uncooperative, spinal precautions should be maintained until the spine is cleared.

If the patient is complaining pain possibly originating from the spine, radiographic evaluations are warranted to prevent deficits caused by a missed thoracolumbar fracture.
