TITLE

Longitudinal analysis of the microscopic dental enamel defects of children in the Imperial Roman community of Portus Romae (necropolis of Isola Sacra, 2nd to 4th century CE, Italy)

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

The mortality profile and the health status of the children of any human population represent a measure of the biocultural adaptability of the community (Goodman and Armelagos, 1989; Lewis, 2018).

As highlighted by several epidemiological studies on modern populations (for a review see Humphrey and King, 2000), the conditions during the first years of life - from intrauterine life until childhood - are often reflected in ill-health and earlier mortality in adult age (Armelagos et al., 2009; Barker, 2004).

However, the reconstruction of life conditions and health in a human skeletal population is an extremely difficult and complex task.

The Osteological Paradox (DeWitte and Stojanowski, 2015; Wood et al., 1992) proposes that skeletal series are biased proxies of the corresponding populations' life conditions.

These authors contend that heterogeneous frailty and selective mortality are disruptive factors, often impossible to quantify in a skeletal series.

However, the individual biological history of the first years of life can be read in the mineralized tissues that form during this period and, particularly, in teeth.

Indeed, dental enamel during its formation is a biological archive, recording at a microscopic level important rhythmical growth markers as well as physiological stress episodes (Antoine et al., 2009; Dean, 2006; Hillson, 2014; Smith and Tafforeau, 2008).

PARAGRAPH

The prevalence in a population of both microscopic (Accentuated Retzius Lines, ALs) and macroscopic (linear enamel hypoplasia) enamel defects is often interpreted as a measure of general health during childhood (Larsen, 2015; Simpson, 1999; Żądzińska et al., 2015).

Histomorphometric studies of tooth enamel depict the daily biological history of an individual from the intra-uterine protected period to the end of tooth formation.

They approximate a kind of longitudinal record, partly overcoming the limitations of using mortality data.

Given that tooth crowns of a single dentition overlap in time during their formation, ALs can be matched among enamel portions that form simultaneously in the separate teeth and can be used to register the combined tooth chronologies of an individual's life.

Using different individuals in a sample can lead to more specific details of the early health status of a skeletal series.

PARAGRAPH

FitzGerald et al. (2006) documented the prevalence of ALs in a large sample of 274 deciduous teeth from the infants of Isola Sacra.

For the purposes of this research, the importance of their study rests not only in the large sample size, but in the fact that it takes into consideration the same population of the present study, thus providing elements for a comparative analysis between the deciduous dentition and the permanent one used in the present analysis.

PARAGRAPH

This contribution is aimed at estimating the childhood health status in the Imperial Roman community at Portus Romae (2nd to 4th century CE, Rome, Italy) during the first four years of individual lives using enamel microscopic defects (ALs).

Because no single tooth records development through this whole growth period, multiple teeth for each individual were sampled to perform a close-to-longitudinal analysis.

SECTION

Dental enamel microdefects

PARAGRAPH

Dental enamel has a complex three-dimensional structure and is produced in a rhythmic manner, reflecting the regular incremental secretion of the matrix by the ameloblasts (Hillson, 2014).

In humans, this rhythmical growth is represented by circadian markers, the cross-striations (Lacruz et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2013) and circaseptan (near-weekly) lines, the brown striae of Retzius (Dean, 1987).

Retzius line Periodicity (RP, i.e. the number of cross-striations between two adjacent brown striae of Retzius) varies in humans between 6 and 12 days (FitzGerald, 1998; Mahoney, 2008; Reid and Ferrell, 2006), but in deciduous enamel 4–5 day intervals have been reported (Mahoney et al., 2016).

The RP is always the same in the permanent dentition of a single individual, but varies among individuals (FitzGerald, 1998).

A correlation among the RP, body mass and the scheduling of life history events exists in some mammalian species (Bromage et al., 2009; Bromage et al., 2012).

More recently, a correlation of the RP with deciduous second molar and permanent molar enamel thickness has been highlighted together with a negative correlation with adult stature, thus “suggesting that there is a common underlying systemic biorhythm that has a role in the final products of human enamel and bone growth” (Mahoney et al., 2018: 26).

PARAGRAPH

Dental enamel is a highly specialized tissue and very sensitive to physiological and environmental changes (Klein et al., 2017).

Consequently, amelogenesis can be disrupted by systemic external stressors, producing permanent enamel defects (FitzGerald and Rose, 2000; FitzGerald and Saunders, 2005; Witzel et al., 2008).

These stresses are recorded at the microscopic level as ALs.

These are also called Accentuated Striae or Wilson Bands and are readable thorough histomorphometry of the dental tissues (FitzGerald et al., 2006; Witzel et al., 2006).

The stress associated with the birth event is recorded in the enamel of individuals surviving the perinatal stage as the Neonatal Line (NL), which is usually the first AL (Sabel et al., 2008; Zanolli et al., 2011).

Stresses that cause metabolic disturbances have been associated with a number of childhood morbidity events, including malnutrition, low birth weight, maternal infections during pregnancy, infections and undernourishment through the stages of weaning and many common febrile childhood illnesses (Birch and Dean, 2014; Hillson, 2014; Schultz et al., 1998; Seow, 1992; Skinner and Goodman, 1992; Teivens et al., 1996; Witzel et al., 2008).

Sample information

PARAGRAPH

The dental sample consists of 84 teeth from the necropolis of Isola Sacra (SCR; Baldassarre, 1978; Sperduti, 1995).

There are 17 deciduous and 67 permanent teeth, selected from 18 individuals (Tables 1 and 2).

The sampling strategy was driven by the following criteria: a) Individuals that possibly died after the completion of the permanent second molar's crown; b) individuals having deciduous canine or second molar and/or the first lower permanent molar unworn, in order to maximize the possibility of identifying the NL.

The first permanent lower molar preserves the NL because it begins to form the mesio-buccal cusp shortly before birth (AlQahtani et al., 2010; Hillson, 2014); c) individual preserving multiple teeth in the dentition, including one deciduous tooth (a canine or a second molar, except for individuals SCR 50 and SCR 279), and a set of permanent teeth including a first molar, a canine, a first or second incisor, and a second molar.

Moreover, the selected individuals must preserve all the antimeres of the sectioned teeth, in order to avoid a fully destructive sampling.

Table 1 reports the list of teeth that were aligned to form each individual's developmental chronology.

Site information

PARAGRAPH

The funerary site of Isola Sacra is located about 23 km south-west of Rome and was used by the inhabitants of the harbor town of Portus Romae, possibly the most important trade center of the Mediterranean in the 1st to 4th century CE.

It was a connection with the faraway provinces of the Empire and its prosperity was deeply linked with that of Rome (Garnsey, 1999a, 1999b).

The necropolis of Isola Sacra is made up of a wide variety of burial structures, from simple interments in sand to wooden coffins, amphorae or sarcophagi to monumental, multiple tombs.

The society of Portus was characterized by the presence of middle-class administrators, traders, and merchants and by the absence of higher social classes (Baldassarre, 1990a, 1990b; Baldassarre et al., 1996; Garnsey, 1999b).

To date, the skeletal inventory from Isola Sacra includes the remains of 248 subadults (Macchiarelli and Bondioli, 2000; Sperduti, 1995).

The skeletal series is kept at the Servizio di Bioarcheologia at the Museo delle Civiltà in Rome, Italy.

PARAGRAPH

A number of analyses have been performed and published on the Isola Sacra odontoskeletal collection, particularly concerning the demographic profile (Sperduti, 1995), diet and health related stresses (Bondioli et al., 2016; FitzGerald et al., 2006; FitzGerald and Saunders, 2005; Hoover et al., 2005; Rossi et al., 1999), occupational markers (Crowe et al., 2010; Sperduti et al., 2012), diet and immigration through isotopic analysis (Prowse et al., 2004; Prowse et al., 2005; Prowse et al., 2007; Prowse et al., 2008), and paleopathology (Marciniak et al., 2016; Marciniak et al., 2018).

SECTION

Histological thin sectioning

PARAGRAPH

After photographic documentation, all teeth were cleaned and embedded in epoxy resin (Epo-Kwick, Buehler) to prevent fractures during sectioning.

Longitudinal sections passing through the tip of the dentine horn along the bucco-lingual plane were made by a diamond blade microtome (Diamond Blade Microtome Leica 1600, Leica AG).

Histological thin sections (Fig. 1) were obtained following the protocol of Caropreso et al. (2000) with some modifications as detailed in Nava (2017).

After the first cut, the exposed surface was mounted on a microscope slide to avoid further cracking of the crown.

Each section was reduced to the thickness of about 100 μm using a motorized grinder (Minimet 1000 Automatic Polishing Machine, Buehler) with water resistant abrasive paper (600 and 1200 grits), and then polished with a micro-tissue and alumina powder (MicroPolish II Alumina 1.0 μm, Buehler).

The sections were etched with a phosphoric acid gel (Etchant Delivery System 3 M) to enhance the enamel microstructures, and finally sealed with a cover slip using a mounting medium for microscopic preparations (Eukitt, O. Kindler GmbH & Co.).

PARAGRAPH

Each thin section was recorded with a digital camera (Leica DFC 295) paired with a transmitted light microscope (Laborlux S, Leica AG) under polarized light, with the magnification of 100× and 400×.

Overlapping pictures at 100× were taken for each crown and assembled in a single micrograph using ICE 2.0 (Image Composite Editor, Microsoft Research Computational Photography Group).

Single images at 400× were taken to analyze the finest details in regions of interest.

SECTION

Scoring and assessment of the chronology of the ALs

PARAGRAPH

There is little agreement among authors on ALs scoring (see FitzGerald and Saunders, 2005; and Witzel et al., 2008 for a full explanation of this problem).

Following FitzGerald et al. (2006), FitzGerald and Saunders (2005) and Goodman and Rose (1990), we used a minimalist criterion to define an accentuated line, based mainly on its length.

Here an AL was identified if it was visible for at least three-quarters of its length, from the enamel-dentin junction to the crown surface in the imbricational enamel or along its path in the cuspal enamel.

PARAGRAPH

For each tooth, once the ALs were identified in the crown, their relative chronology was established using direct counts of the daily incremental cross-striations or counting the regular striae of Retzius, the latter multiplied by the individual RP.

For a methodological review see FitzGerald and Saunders (2005), Guatelli-Steinberg et al. (2012), and Nava (2017).

PARAGRAPH

For each individual, starting from birth marked by the NL, the reconstruction of the absolute ALs chronology of an individual's life was possible because portions of tooth crowns that form at the same time usually have the same patterns of ALs.

An absolute individual chronology is therefore obtained through matching of homologous ALs chronological intervals on two or more teeth (Fig. 1).

Perfectly matching intervals are exceptional, even if present, so for each set of co-eval intervals a “consensus” was determined, calculated as the mean of the values observed in different teeth (see Supplementary Material Table S1).

Assessment of the stress prevalence in the sample

PARAGRAPH

The monthly prevalence of stresses in the sample was derived from the individual ALs sequences.

Prevalence is defined as the number of cases of a condition in the total sample in a given moment of time (Waldron, 2007).

Here, the prevalence of stresses is calculated as the number of individuals with at least one AL in a given month, divided by the number of individuals that are forming their tooth crowns in the same month.

The prevalence denominator is not constant through the time span considered, but gradually decreases as long as the individuals completed the secretion of the enamel in the crowns (FitzGerald et al., 2006).

Because the most cervical portion of each crown is known to be less sensitive in recording stresses (FitzGerald et al., 2006), in this study we assumed end of recording in an individual as the moment when the last AL was formed.

PARAGRAPH

All statistical analysis, graphs, Bayesian statistical modeling (WARN package, Tsutaya and Yoneda, 2013) and the local polynomial regression fitting were made with the R package for statistical computing (v. 3.4.4) (R-Core-Team, 2017).

Results

PARAGRAPH

Table 1 presents data for the 18 individuals analyzed, with age at death estimated from dental and skeletal maturation (AlQahtani et al., 2010; Fazekas and Kósa, 1978; Scheuer and Black, 2000).

All individuals have a mixed dentition, except SCR 050 and SCR 279 for which a deciduous element was not available for sectioning (Table 1).

Ages at death range between 4 and 20–21 years.

Table 2 shows the composition of the dental sample by tooth type, class and arch.

A total of 652 ALs were recorded in the complete dental sample (Supplementary Material Table S1).

In all individuals it was possible to match patterns from tooth to tooth from birth until almost the end of the formation of the second permanent molar crown, except for the two individuals SCR 002 and SCR 218 where the chronology was limited to the permanent canine.

PARAGRAPH

Table 3 reports the raw occurrence of the ALs by tooth by individual.

In all 84 teeth analyzed we found at least one AL, but multiple ALs are present in most crowns.

Table 4 reports the mean number of ALs by tooth type.

The most affected teeth are the permanent anterior ones and particularly the central incisor (I1) and the canine (C), which are indeed the elements with the longer crown formation times (AlQahtani et al., 2010).

PARAGRAPH

Table 5 lists the number of stresses suffered during tooth formation by each individual.

The same event recorded in two or more teeth from a single dentition was counted as a single stressing event in the individual's life.

It is worth noting that the correlation between the number of stresses suffered during the first six and twelve months and the individual age at death are not significantly different from zero (p = 0.9086, p = 0.7237, respectively).

Table 5 reports also the RP in the sample.

The observed values are 8 or 9 cross-striations between two Retzius lines.

PARAGRAPH

Fig. 2 reports the crude count of ALs by months, considering the matching ALs as a single event (n = 386).

The time interval covered by the aligned crowns spans between birth and 69 months, or 5 years/9 months.

Following the local polynomial regression fitting curve, the sample distribution is asymmetrical with a mode around the 11th month of life.

In the first month the frequency is rather low (2 ALs), then, the frequencies grow rapidly until the 11th - 13th month, with a slight peak at the 4th month.

After the modal months, the distribution decreases until the 22nd month.

Between the 22nd and the 44th month, the distribution is mostly stable with some wavering with peaks at months 28, 30, 35 and 41.

The last 24 months are characterized by a very low frequency of stress events.

PARAGRAPH

Fig. 3 graphs the monthly prevalence (see Section 2.5) of the ALs during the first 52 months (corresponding to 4 years/4 months), when at least 5 individuals are forming their dental crowns.

Because the numerator of the prevalence formula is calculated as the number of individuals with at least one AL in a given month, the shape of the prevalence distribution is slightly different from the crude count (Fig. 2), even in the first months when the denominator is constant.

Supplementary Material Table S2 reports the number of individuals who are forming the crowns across time (i.e. the prevalence denominator).

PARAGRAPH

In the first 25 months the distribution of prevalence is comparable with the crude frequency of ALs.

After the 26th month, the prevalence is higher than the raw frequency given the decline in the number of individuals recording the stresses.

The last 17 months have been omitted in Fig. 3 because the corresponding prevalence values are affected by small sample size.

PARAGRAPH

Fig. 4 shows the disaggregation of the raw ALs' count by tooth, approximated by density estimates.

The single distributions for the deciduous teeth and the permanent molars tend to follow a bell-shaped curve with the highest values in the middle period of crown formation, as already observed by FitzGerald et al. (2006) for the deciduous teeth of the same Roman population.

The permanent incisors and the permanent canines show a wider distribution, but still retain higher values in the middle of the crown formation time.

PARAGRAPH

As shown in Fig. 4, during the formation of the dental enamel, the secreting ameloblasts seem to be not equally susceptible to the stress along the crown.

The distribution for each tooth class suggests that in the cuspal area (the portion of the crown with the highest enamel extension rate) and in the cervical region (where the enamel extension rate is at its minimum) the likelihood that a physiological stress will be recorded or detectable is much lower than in the central part of the crown.

A uniform distribution would be expected if the whole crown was equally able to record the stress.

This phenomenon seems to be stronger in the molars of both the deciduous and permanent dentition, which show a narrower distribution.

PARAGRAPH

The contribution for each individual to the general stress occurrence is reported in Supplementary Material Fig. S1.

The contribution for each individual to the general stress occurrence is reported in Supplementary Material Fig. S1.

PARAGRAPH

In the present analysis, the highest peaks of ALs prevalence are observed around the 9th–11th months of age, with a preceding modal peak between the 3rd and the 6th month.

When comparing these results with the FitzGerald et al. (2006) figures, the stress distribution is not statistically different for the first nine months (Chi squared = 12.92, df = 8, p = 0.11) (Fig. 5).

PARAGRAPH

After the 9th month, the values of the stress distribution of the present analysis start to considerably diverge from the ones of FitzGerald et al. (2006) (Chi squared = 24.17, df = 3, p < 0.001).

Around one year of age, a prevalence of 80% of the present analysis contrasts with a <10% from the results of FitzGerald et al. (2006).

This difference is due by the differential recording capability observed along the single dental crown.

PARAGRAPH

Results of the FitzGerald et al. (2006) analysis are affected by the use of the only deciduous elements of the dentition whose formation time cover the first twelve months of life.

Indeed, the most cervical part of deciduous teeth underestimates the ALs prevalence after the ninth month.

Conversely, in the present analysis, the time span around one year is fully covered by the forming crowns of the permanent M1, C, I1, and I2, therefore, overcoming the bias.

PARAGRAPH

According to the known pattern of dental formation and eruption (AlQahtani et al., 2010), the completion of both the crown and the root of C precedes by 2–3 years the same structures of the permanent second molar.

In Table 6 the degrees of development of C and of M2 in the sample are compared, as scored according to AlQahtani et al. (2010).

All sampled individuals, but one (SCR 036), have developing Cs and M2 s roots at the moment of death.

Of the remaining 17 individuals, 15 have the Cs and M2 s available for recording developmental patterns.

Five individuals show a relative degree of development of C and M2 that roughly corresponds to the sequences published in AlQahtani et al. (2010), with the development of C advanced compared to M2.

In 10 of 15 cases the degree of development of C and M2 is surprisingly almost coincident.

This peculiar C vs M2 development is also confirmed from the analysis of M2s after the chronological alignment of the individual crowns.

However, the discrepancy with AlQahtani et al. (2010) could be explained by a possible unbalanced sex composition of the subadult sample in the present analysis, which is unknown.

Because males tend towards more delayed C development relative to M2 than females (AlQahtani et al., 2010), we could hypothesize that this sample have slightly more males than females.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Results of this study show how it is possible to derive a longitudinal profile of the health status in children of an ancient population by analyzing enamel microscopic defects, whose time of onset was estimated using odontochronology.

This approach reduces some of the confounding factors usually seen in paleo-epidemiological studies and overcomes some of the problems associated with the use of mortality samples (Bondioli et al., 2016; DeWitte and Stojanowski, 2015; Wood et al., 1992).

PARAGRAPH

The series considered in this analysis is, in its essence, a mortality sample.

However, care was taken to select individuals who died far from the end of the crown formation.

The only exception is individual SCR 031, aged 3–4 years, who was still forming the permanent crowns at the moment of death.

The correlation between the age at death and the morbidity in the selected sample is close to zero.

As a consequence, the distribution of the monthly prevalence of the ALs shown in Fig. 3 offers a reliable estimate of the variation of the childhood health status during the first four years of life in the community of Portus Romae.

PARAGRAPH

Non-fatal stresses during childhood in pre-industrial time are generally associated with the occurrence of various infectious diseases and to dietary changes related to weaning (Birch and Dean, 2014; Goodman and Rose, 1990; Hillson, 2014; Schultz et al., 1998; Seow, 1992; Skinner and Goodman, 1992; Teivens et al., 1996; Witzel et al., 2008).

The first months of life are usually protected by the presence of the maternally derived antibodies (Glezen, 2003) that directly relate to the low ALs prevalence figures observed during this time (Fig. 3).

PARAGRAPH

When comparing the ALs profile with previously published δ15N and δ13C bulk bone collagen data derived from the children's ribs of the same necropolis (Prowse et al., 2008), we can hypothesize weaning as the main etiological factor shaping the stress distribution in the present sample.

Prowse et al. (2008) found the beginning of the weaning process was close to one year, when the isotopic signatures of the infants start to decline towards adult values.

Isotopic carbon and nitrogen values comparable with the adult diet were reached after 2.5 years of age.

PARAGRAPH

More recently, Tsutaya (2017) and Tsutaya and Yoneda (2013) used, among other datasets, nitrogen isotope data from Prowse et al. (2008) to reconstruct breastfeeding practices in past human populations.

They proposed a model for reconstructing precise weaning ages with a Bayesian statistical approach that incorporates turnover rates derived from data on bone metabolism reported in previous studies.

Tsutaya and Yoneda (2013) developed the WARN (Weaning Age Reconstruction with Nitrogen isotopes analysis) package for the R environment for statistical computing (R-Core-Team, 2017), that allows estimation of the initiation of weaning (t1), the cessation of breastfeeding (t2), and the probability that t1 and t2 lie within a given time range.

The WARN package estimates t1 and t2 from the sample values of δ15N and from prior distributions of t1 and t2.

PARAGRAPH

Tsutaya and Yoneda (2013) estimated t1 and t2 for the Isola Sacra sample at 3.6 and 13.2 months respectively.

The authors report that “for the Isola Sacra population […] the prior distributions were set to have means of [0 and 12 months] and SDs of [12 and 12 months] for t1 and t2, respectively, because this dataset had the unique features of younger weaning ages and higher E values, which complicated the parameter optimization” (Tsutaya and Yoneda, 2013: 8).

In their analysis, “E” corresponds to the observed child-mother δ15N-enrichment.

Because it is possible that the choice of the prior distribution affects the results, and because we considered the 0 and 12 months set by Tsutaya and Yoneda (2013) as unrealistic, we recalculated t1 and t2 using WARN, starting from a more realistic prior (means [9.6 and 30 months] and SDs of [7 and 7 months]), extracted from the ALs prevalence distribution.

We assumed a standard deviation slightly shorter than the maximum prevalence minus the two first months and adopted a “reverse” form of the model curve for the weaning process instead of the “parabolic” available as default with WARN.

PARAGRAPH

The re-elaborated WARN model (Fig. 6) indicates a possible time of the initiation of weaning (t1) around 8.4 months and the cessation of breastfeeding (t2) at 30 months.

PARAGRAPH

We believe that this weaning time interval can be a good explanation for the data gained from the ALs prevalence of the present analysis.

The observed peak of stress prevalence around the 3rd-4th months can be associated with the time when infants begin to sit up and interact with their surroundings, coming into a more direct contact with possible pathogens (Berk, 2003).

Our results are also supported by the historical sources on weaning in Roman time, like the Gynaecology of Soranus of Ephesos (2nd cent.

CE), the Hygiene of Galen of Pergamum (2nd cent.

CE), and a number of wet-nurse Egyptian contracts (1st cent.

BCE – 4th cent.

CE) (for a review see Prowse et al., 2008 and FitzGerald et al., 2006).

These ancient sources support the beginning of transitional feeding (i.e. the progressive reduction of breast milk and introduction of solid food) after the 6th month and the completion of weaning between 2 and 3 years of age.

PARAGRAPH

In Roman times, Dupras et al. (2001) and Dupras and Tocheri (2007) reported, in the Kellis population from Egypt, a range for the start of transitional feeding/complete weaning between 6 months and 3 years, whereas Fuller et al. (2006) reported in a Late/Sub Roman Britain population 3–4 years as the age of complete weaning.

The Isola Sacra data for the weaning schedule is well inside the general weaning habits of the Roman Empire in the first centuries of the first millennium CE.

PARAGRAPH

Recently, the importance of physiological stress on the nitrogen isotopic signature in bone collagen has been highlighted by Beaumont et al. (2018), who suggest that above a threshold of stress, osteoblasts may not produce any new collagen.

Nevertheless, our results show a concordant agreement between the present paper physiological stress profiles and the Prowse et al. (2008) figures.

PARAGRAPH

Finally, it is worth noting a significant difference between the relative developmental patterns of C and M2 in the Isola Sacra sample and the published models based mostly on modern collections (AlQahtani et al., 2010).

In Isola Sacra, M2 seems to develop earlier and, in most cases, follows the same developmental trajectories of the C.

A possible explanation could be the composition by sex of our sample, but a discrepancy between the modern dental deciduous enamel growth rates and the Roman Imperial times was previously observed in the penecontemporary series of Velia (1st-2nd century CE, Salerno, Italy) by Nava et al. (2017a) and in the Upper Palaeolithic fetus Ostuni 1b (Nava et al., 2017b).

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

The non-specificity of the ALs as stress markers allows us to use their prevalence as generalized indicator of adaptive responsiveness of the Portus Romae population.

Stress prevalence was established longitudinally from birth to about four years of age.

This gives not only one single frame at the moment of death, but a “movie” of the stresses in the first years of life.

Prevalence of ALs during early childhood for the Isola Sacra skeletal assemblage is high, but no correlation exists between ALs prevalence and age at death.

The majority of stresses seem to accumulate in the first 25 months of life so that the prevalence profile tends to reach a stable level afterwards.

We propose that the presence of the observed levels of ALs is not indicative of a poor health status of the Isola Sacra infants.

Rather, they represent a picture of short-term non-fatal stresses during infancy buffered by a reasonable quality of life, as inferable both from the diet (Prowse et al., 2004, 2005, 2008) and from the social conditions (Garnsey, 1999b).

PARAGRAPH

Among stressors, weaning can explain the prevalence distribution of the ALs observed in the first 3 years of age at Isola Sacra.

The scoring of microscopic enamel defects during growth results in individual stress profiles that are almost free of the mortality bias that occurs in skeletal populations (Wood et al., 1992).

Conversely, the individuals that enter routinely in stable isotope analyses, aimed at determining the weaning patterns, are children who are non-survivors (King et al., 2018; Tsutaya and Yoneda, 2015).

Moreover, the isotopic values derived from skeletal material are also affected by bone turnover and represent the diet that occurred months or even years before death (Beardsworth et al., 1990; Beaumont et al., 2015; Hedges et al., 2007; O'Connell et al., 2001; Tsutaya and Yoneda, 2013).

Given this, a certain degree of difference between the weaning estimated through ALs scoring and weaning based on isotopic signature in bones (Prowse et al., 2008) would be expected.

Statistical models, like the one from Tsutaya and Yoneda (2013), take into account these biases, but accurate a priori parameters should be chosen before applying the models.

Results of our research underscore three main points.

(a) Any attempt to create a stress prevalence profile in a skeletal sample based on both macro- and microscopic enamel defects cannot take into consideration single dental elements and has to be based on the alignment of different teeth with overlapping development.

(b) Dental crowns of deciduous and permanent teeth show a topographical differential susceptibility to the stress, that is minimum at the beginning and at the end of the crown formation, and which is more reliable in the middle of the crown formation.

(c) A multifactorial approach to the palaeobiology of a skeletal series is rewarding and allows the correlation, with a good approximation of weaning, developmental stress and the overall health status of these ancient Roman Imperial infants.
