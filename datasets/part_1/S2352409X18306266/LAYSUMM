TITLE

Longitudinal analysis of the microscopic dental enamel defects of children in the Imperial Roman community of Portus Romae (necropolis of Isola Sacra, 2nd to 4th century CE, Italy)

PARAGRAPH

This study estimates the health status during the first years of life in children from the Imperial Roman community of Portus Romae using microscopic enamel defect chronology.

These are non-fatal events track the way enamel is laid down in tooth development and are permanent markers of dietary and non-fatal disease stress.

The prevalence distribution, compared with the previously published isotopic dietary signals, suggests that the maximum stress relates to the beginning of weaning.

Results indicate that each tooth class has a different capability for recording stress and that the maximum sensitivity for this is in the mid-portion of the crown.
