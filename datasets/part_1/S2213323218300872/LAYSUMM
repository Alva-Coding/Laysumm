TITLE

Heterotopia or overlaying cortex: What about in-between?

PARAGRAPH

Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) is an anomaly of the part of the brain, which causes epileptic seizures.

Medications frequently could not stop the seizures and surgical treatment is warranted.

However, it is difficult to locate the exact regions that give rise to seizures in an indi-vidual patient and to operate them without damaging the surrounding brain.

We describe a patient whose examination revealed that seizures were arising from PNH and neurons scattered within ad-jacent white matter.

We used the minimally invasive procedure of laser ablation to target them.

The patient is seizure free afterward with a normal level of functioning.
