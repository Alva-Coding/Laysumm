TITLE

Combinatorial search for selecting the structure of models of dynamical systems with equation discovery

PARAGRAPH

Scientific discoveries often describe the behavior of dynamical systems with equations.

Systems typically have components and their behavior is a result of interactions between these components.

We present an artificial intelligence method for discovering equations from measurements.

The method approaches equation discovery as a task of combinatorial search for an optimal combination of equation fragments, where each fragment describes an interaction in the modeled system.

We explore the efficiency of different search techniques for discovering equation-based models of population and biochemical dynamics, and explain their relative performance by analyzing the properties of the space of equations they search.
