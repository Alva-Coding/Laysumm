TITLE

Heating mollusc shells - A radiocarbon and microstructure perspective from archaeological shells recovered from Kalba, Sharjah Emirate, UAE

PARAGRAPH

Shells can be dated using radiocarbon and therefore provide an age which might help to reconstruct the chronology of a site.

Sometimes the shells found have been heated.

Usually burning is visible as a greyish colour.

But sometimes it is not visible.

Our results on Anadara uropigimelana and Terebralia palustris shells from Neolithic and Bronze Age sites in Kalba (UAE) show, that the radiocarbon age is not influenced by the heating process, but the mineralogy changes from aragonite to calcite.

Besides we finally found out how the shells were heated regarding the use of fire and arrangement of shells.
