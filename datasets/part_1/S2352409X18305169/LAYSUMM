TITLE

GIS modeling of agricultural suitability in the highlands of the Jornada branch of the Mogollon culture of southcentral New Mexico

PARAGRAPH

Measures of site location in relation to agricultural potential are an important tool for identifying relative shifts in the importance of agriculture in prehistoric economies over time.

We examine GIS modeling of agricultural potential based on soil characteristics, topography, and proximity to drainage in the highlands of the Mogollon culture of southcentral New Mexico.

We describe methods, limitations, and advantages of this approach.

Preliminary results support other evidence of strong agricultural reliance in the pithouse period, substantially greater than in the Archaic; the pueblo period may be slightly more linked to optimal agricultural land, though the latter conclusion is uncertain.
