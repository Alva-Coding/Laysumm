TITLE

Micro-archaeological indicators for identifying ancient cess deposits: An example from Late Bronze Age Megiddo, Israel

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

On the final day of excavations of the 2012 season at Tel Megiddo (northern Israel, Fig. 1) a yellowish fibrous feature was detected.

This 2–3 mm thick feature, ca. 40 × 15 cm in size (Fig. 2), was associated with a well-built structure in Level H-14, which dates, based on ceramic finds, to the Late Bronze Age IIA in the 14th century BCE (for radiocarbon dating, see Boaretto, forthcoming).

Area H is located in the northwestern sector of the site (Fig. 3), near the Late Bronze Age palace unearthed in the course of the University of Chicago excavations in the 1930s (Area AA, Fig. 4; Loud, 1948), and in proximity to the gate of the city (Fig. 3).

Level H-14 is contemporaneous with the Amarna archives – the diplomatic correspondence of Pharaohs Amenophis III and Amenophis IV (Akhenaten) with Near Eastern kingdoms and Canaanite petty-kings, written in Akkadian cuneiform and found in Egypt in the late 19th century CE.

Among the ca. 370 tablets, there are six that were sent by Biridiya, the ruler of Megiddo, presumably one of the inhabitants of the Megiddo palace.

PARAGRAPH

The fragile-looking yellowish fibrous feature was removed from Level H-14 for further analysis.

It was extracted as a block of sediment, ca. 30 cm thick, covered by plaster of Paris (gypsum) to keep it intact.

Attempts to reveal the nature of the find with the naked eye failed.

We therefore turned to several micro-archaeological investigations: infrared spectroscopy, petrographic microscopy and lipid analyses.

The results led us to suspect that it was related to cess deposits.

Based on this hypothesis, we further analyzed the yellowish fibrous material for pollen and gastrointestinal parasite remains.

PARAGRAPH

Below we aim to: (i) present the steps taken in our investigation of the yellowish fibrous material that led us to identify it as part of a cesspit; (ii) define micro-archaeological indicators that can be used to identify cess deposits; (iii) shed additional light on the Late Bronze Age palatial area of Megiddo and some dietary components of its residents.

SECTION

The find and its stratigraphic context

PARAGRAPH

The yellowish fibrous feature was found in Square E/7 in elevation 155.50 asl (Figs. 5 and 6).

Above it excavation revealed an accumulation of dark brown mudbrick debris, ca. 75 cm thick (elevation ca. 156.25–155.50 asl), containing white nodules.

In the lower part of this debris, below elevation 155.85 asl a large number of medium-sized (ca. 30 cm in diameter) stones with no well-defined architectural remains was encountered.

PARAGRAPH

The fibrous feature was found encircled by some of these stones (Fig. 2), indicating that it was located within a round installation or in a stone-lined pit (elevation 155.55–155.21), only the bottom of which was preserved.

The color and texture of the sediments within and outside the assumed pit were similar.

In the immediate vicinity of the find many small (ca. 10 cm in diameter) limestone pebbles covered by a hard brown crust were uncovered; some of them were collected and kept for analysis (Fig. 7).

PARAGRAPH

Locus 12/H/75 was sealed by two walls and a floor of Level H-13 (bottom level in elevation 156.30 asl), which is well-dated by ceramic finds and radiocarbon samples (for the latter, see Boaretto, forthcoming) to the Late Bronze Age IIB, in the 13th century BCE.

For reasons of safety, Square E/7 was not excavated during the 2014 season, yet excavations continued in the adjacent Square E/8 (Fig. 5), resulting in the exposure of Room 14/H/12, which belonged to Level H-14.

The stone pavement of this room (elevation ca. 155.70–155.80 asl) is related to two rows of stones located in the northern section of Square E/7 (seen in the aerial view – Fig. 5); the latter may be interpreted as belonging the southern wall of Room 14/H/12 (Fig. 6).

Hence, we suggest that “installation” 12/H/75 belongs to Level H-14, associated with Late Bronze IIA pottery and dated to the 14th century BCE.

PARAGRAPH

Area H is a sectional trench two squares (10 m) wide – too narrow to determine the exact layout of the remains.

Still, from the solid walls in neighboring squares it seems that installation is located in a well-built structure (see, e.g., Square E/9 in Fig. 5) rather than in an open area.

The elaborate architecture, prestigious finds and better quality nutrition expressed in the faunal remains, all indicate that this part of the site was inhabited by an elite group that was probably associated with the adjacent palace (Area AA, Fig. 4; Arie, 2013, forthcoming; Sapir-Hen et al., 2016).

Materials and methods

SECTION

Mineralogical identification and microscopy

PARAGRAPH

The yellowish fibrous material (Fig. 2) was sampled in three locations, and four samples from the brown-colored crusts found on the limestone pebbles that surrounded it were collected as well (Fig. 7).

Infrared spectroscopic analyses were conducted using the KBr method (see details in Weiner, 2010) and Nicolet 380 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).

Spectra were interpreted using the reference library of the Kimmel Center for Archaeological Science, Weizmann Institute of Science.

In addition, a 1 × 2 cm fragment of the yellowish fibrous material was impregnated with polyester resin, prepared as a 30 μm thin section specimen for microscopy, and studied using a Nikon Eclipse 50i polarized light microscope.

SECTION

Lipid analysis

PARAGRAPH

Four samples were subjected to lipid residue analysis: two were collected from the yellowish fibrous material, one from the gray sediment below this layer (to serve as control) and the last from a brown crust from one of the stones that encircled the yellowish material.

The extraction and analysis procedures of the lipids followed Evershed et al. (1990) and Charters et al. (1993).

Samples of about 20 mg were collected using a clean scalpel blade and ground manually to a homogenized powder in a porcelain pestle and mortar.

A blank sample was run routinely with the samples to monitor any possible laboratory contamination.

The samples were first sonicated with 2 mL of dichloromethane and methanol (2:1, v/v), and sonicated for 10 min.

Following, the samples were centrifuged to separate the ground powder from the solvents.

The solvents were decanted to a clean glass vial and then evaporated to dryness.

100 μL of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide containing 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) was added to the dry extracts followed by heating at 70 °C for 20 min.

One microliter of each sample was injected into the gas chromatograph (GC) with mass selective detector (MSD).

GC/MS analyses were carried out using a HP7890 gas chromatograph coupled to a HP5973 mass spectrometer (electron multiplier potential 2 KV, filament current 0.35 mA, electron energy 70 eV, and the spectra were recorded over the range m/z 40 to 800).

Helium was used as a carrier gas at a constant flow of 1.1 mL s− 1.

The inlet was heated to 220 °C and the sample was injected in a split of 1:10.

An isothermal hold at 50 °C was kept for 2 min, followed by a heating gradient of 10 °C min− 1 to 320 °C, with the final temperature held for 10 min.

A 30 m, 0.25 mm HP-5MS with a 0.25 μm film thickness was used for separation.

The MS interface temperature was 300 °C.

The results were calibrated against known amounts of the internal standard (1-nonadecanol, C19Ol) added to each sample.

Peak assignments were carried out with the aid of library spectra (NIST 1.6) and compared with published data.

SECTION

Palynology

PARAGRAPH

Seven samples were collected for the palynological investigation: Sample 1 is from the yellowish fibrous material.

Sample 2 is from the brown crust that was recovered from one of the limestone pebbles.

Samples 3 and 4 were collected from the gray sediment 1 cm and 5 cm below the yellowish fibrous feature, respectively.

A control sample (no. 5) which represents the recent “pollen rain” was collected in December 2014 from surface sediments, 20 m west of Area H. Samples 6 and 7 were collected from the dark brown sediment characteristic of Locus 12/H/75, at the level of the installation but ca. 2 m away from it (also for control purposes).

Sampling strategies and techniques followed the recommendations of Bryant (1974a, 1974b).

PARAGRAPH

Each sample went through surface cleaning to remove any possibility of modern pollen contamination.

Pollen extraction followed a physical-chemical preparation procedure (Faegri and Iversen, 1989).

One standard Lycopodium spore tablet was added to each sample (batch number 1031) in order to calculate pollen concentrations (Stockmarr, 1971).

Pollen grains were identified under a light microscope, with magnifications of 200 ×, 400 × and 1000 × (oil immersion).

In each sample, all the extracted pollen grains were counted and identified.

Pollen grains were identified to the lowest possible systematic level.

For pollen identification, a comparative reference collection of the Israeli pollen flora of Tel Aviv University (Steinhardt Museum of Natural History) was used, in addition to pollen atlases (e.g., Beug, 2004; Reille, 1995, 1998, 1999).

SECTION

Paleoparasitology

PARAGRAPH

Paleoparasitological investigations were carried out on four samples from the yellowish fibrous material and from the brown crust (Locus 12/H/75).

These analyses aimed at retrieving eggs of gastrointestinal helminths parasitizing humans or animals.

Samples were prepared following the standard extraction protocol as detailed in Dufour and Le Bailly (2013).

Five gram sub-samples were rehydrated during one week in a mix solution of 0.5% trisodic phosphate (TSP) and 5% glycerinated water.

The suspensions were placed in an ultrasonic bath device for 1 min and passed through columns composed of sieves with different meshes (315 μm, 160 μm, 50 μm and 25 μm).

As average helminth egg size is between 30 and 160 μm long and 15 and 100 μm wide, the last two sieve residues were observed.

Twenty slides from each prepared sample were analyzed using light microscopy (Olympus BX-51).

Results

SECTION

Mineralogical identification and microscopy

PARAGRAPH

All samples studied using infrared spectroscopy are composed of the same minerals, characterized by presence of high amounts of carbonated hydroxylapatite, associated with clay, calcite and quartz.

These minerals are common at Tel Megiddo (c.f., Regev et al., 2015).

In thin section, structures typical of vegetal tissue were observed, associated with a phosphatized groundmass (Fig. 8).

SECTION

Lipid analysis

PARAGRAPH

Three out of the four samples that were subjected to residue analysis yielded extractable organic compounds in relatively high amounts (Table 1, sample nos. 1–3).

The gray sediment below the yellowish fibrous feature (which served as a control) yielded no lipids but squalene, a contaminant possibly deriving from initially handling the sample in the field with bare hands (Table 1, Sample 4).

The chemical compositions of the three positive extracts, two from the yellowish fibrous material and one from the crust on a nearby stone, are not similar; still, the general observation points to the presence of nitrogen- and sulfur-rich compounds (thiols).

Cholesterol was detected in all three samples.

In two extracts coprostanol was found and in one sample it was accompanied by squalene – a human/animal related compound (Fig. 9).

Two samples also had n-alcohols containing 14, 16, 18 and 24 carbons in their chains as well as branched fatty acids (C16:1 and C18:1), palmitic and stearic acids.

Note that the preference of palmitic acid over stearic acid (C16:0 ≫ C18:0) is usually attributed to a vegetal rather than an animal source (Baeten et al., 2013), a notion that worth revision.

The brown crust sampled from a limestone pebble found next to the yellowish fibrous feature contained phosphate enriched compounds, sterols and stanols (i.e., coprostanol, ergostanol, lanosterol and cholesterol) as well as diacid and fatty acids along with n-alkanes.

Better preservation of the organic compounds was detected when it was bound to the carbonate mineral in the pebble than when it was extracted from loose sediment.

SECTION

Palynology

PARAGRAPH

Samples 6 and 7 were almost pollen barren; only two degraded pollen grains were identified in Sample 6: a grain of Atriplex type (saltbush) and a grain of Cedrus libani (cedar of Lebanon).

The poor state of pollen preservation in these two control samples is not surprising since similar results characterize many other pollen samples from Megiddo analyzed by one of us (DL).

Pollen ratios of the other five samples are presented in Table 2.

The total number of pollen grains counted in each sample and the pollen concentrations are given at the bottom of the column.

Due to the relatively high frequencies of pollen of edible/potable plants (mainly zoophilous plants), we arranged the results in two groups: pollen that can be linked with high probability to purposeful ingestion of certain plant foods/drinks, and pollen that is linked with high probability to the natural environment (mainly anemophilous plants).1

The latter group may reflect local and regional pollen rain which was accidentally ingested or trapped within the investigated material (more below).

PARAGRAPH

As expected, the modern control sample has the highest pollen concentration (Sample 5: 2,405 grains/gram sediment).

About 95% of the identified grains within this sample belong to the group of pollen of the natural environment while only ca. 5% derive from the group of plants that can be eaten or drunk.

The archaeological samples contain lower concentrations of pollen (164–682 grains/gram sediment; n = 4), most probably related to poorer state of pollen preservation as can be gleaned from the relatively high ratios of the unrecognized grains in the archaeological samples vs. the lower ratios in the modern control sample (Table 2).

Samples 1 and 2, from the yellowish fibrous material and the brown crust in that order are mainly composed of taxa that belong to the edible/potable plants group (60% and 75% respectively).

In Samples 3 and 4, the ratios between the digested pollen and the pollen which derived from the natural environment are close to equal.

All four archaeological samples are significantly enriched in zoophilous pollen relative to Sample 5 (the modern control sample).

After the conventional microscopic observations, only one element was recovered, probably corresponding to a poorly preserved egg of whipworm (genus Trichuris; Fig. 10).

Discussion

SECTION

Identification of the feature as a cesspit

PARAGRAPH

The data presented above is based on various micro-archaeological methods of material identification and characterization.

Macro remains such as hair, bones and teeth were absent from the yellowish fibrous material.

The petrographic microscopy enabled the first identification of the this material as deriving from plant origin, while infrared spectroscopy revealed that plant cellular structures were preserved due to phosphatization.

PARAGRAPH

The phosphate mineral carbonated hydroxylapatite is known to originate in nature as (1) the mineral of which vertebrate skeletal material is composed, including bones and teeth (Lowenstam and Weiner, 1989), and (2) as the product of organic matter degradation, where phosphate-rich organic compounds degrade and release phosphate into the soil solution that binds to calcium ions if they are present in the environment (Shahack-Gross et al., 2004 and references therein).

Fecal material, especially that produced by carnivores whose diet is rich in proteins, is known to be rich in phosphate (see for instance Table 8.2 in Weiner, 2010).

Because the microscopic analysis did not reveal presence of skeletal material (bones, teeth), the inevitable conclusion is that the yellowish fibrous material studied here is related to degraded fecal material.

PARAGRAPH

Studies of archaeological latrine/cess deposits report that botanic material may be preserved in them through the mechanism of phosphate replacement, i.e., phosphate-rich solutions penetrate into plant material and the deposited mineral replaces the organic components in a manner that preserves the microscopic cellular structure of the botanic material (e.g., Green, 1979; Marshall et al., 2008; McCobb et al., 2001, 2003).

The exact mineralogical composition of the phosphate compounds is not always easy to determine, but most studies report a composition that is very close to carbonated hydroxylapatite.

This information indicates that the yellowish fibrous material, composed of phosphatized vegetal matter, may have originated from cess deposits.

PARAGRAPH

The results from the lipid analysis show the presence of sterols and stanols, organic compounds that may be related to fecal material.

These compounds were not detected in the control sample; moreover the amount of these compounds in the different extracts (around 30 mg total lipids per 1 gram sediment and about 70 mg total lipids per 1 gram crust) is far too high to be the result of contamination (≫ 5 μg/g).

Sterols are synthesized in most animals, plants, and yeast and occur widely in living organisms as lipid constituents.

Cholesterol is a compound characteristic of mammals (Gunstone, 2004; Kanazawa and Teshima, 1978).

A certain amount of cholesterol is excreted into feces after undergoing reduction of the double bond to coprostanol by intestinal microorganisms (Rosenfeld and Gallagher, 1964; Rosenfeld et al., 1954).

Coprostanol, a stanol formed from the bio-hydrogenation of cholesterol in the gut of higher animals has long been used as a biomarker for the presence of human/animal fecal matter (Bethell, 1994; D'Anjou et al., 2012; Sistiaga et al., 2014).

In anaerobic sediments and soils, coprostanol is stable for long periods of time, enabling it to be used as an indicator of past fecal remains (Mudge and Ball, 2006).

In both extracts of the installation samples coprostanol and cholesterol were detected in relatively equal amounts.

The presence of coprostanol in two samples, along with cholesterol relates our finds to the presence of fecal remains (Bethell, 1994).

Other sterols and stanols were recorded in the extracts, such as ergosterol and lanosterol.

Ergosterol (ergosta-7,7,22-trien-3β-ol) is a sterol found in the cell membrane of fungi and protozoa (Dupont et al., 2012).

Lanosterol is a triterpenoid and is the compound from which all animal and fungi steroids are derived (Clouse, 2002; Engelking, 2014).

By contrast, plant steroids are produced via cycloartenol (Schaller, 2003).

Demethylation of lanosterol eventually yields cholesterol.

Lanosterol is formed first by the epoxidation of the double bond of squalene, which was also found in the extracts of the installation samples.

Relatively high amounts of phosphate and nitrogen enriched molecules have been detected in the extracts, among them thiols that appear in nature although they are relatively rare (Le Bozec and Moody, 2009).

Overall, the lipid analysis points to a mixed result that may suggest the presence of human/animal fecal remains together with plant-originated residues.

PARAGRAPH

Taken together, the mineralogical, microscopic and lipid residue analyses support and amplify each other, strongly suggesting that the feature under study is composed of the remains of feces.

Considering the spatial association of the fibrous yellowish material within a circular feature of pebbles suggests that the feature is the bottom of a constructed cesspit.

Based on this information, we explored the fecal remains through further pollen analysis.

SECTION

The dietary components in the cess deposit

PARAGRAPH

Most of the pollen grains that were extracted from the yellowish fibrous material and from the brown crust (Samples 1 and 2, Table 2) originated from edible plants, probably resulting from eating (e.g., cereals, and olives) or drinking potions (e.g., mint, sage, myrtle and nettle) made from certain plants.

This observation supports the analyses and interpretation above, that the material is related to cess deposits.

Within these pollen assemblages, Ficus carica (common fig) is probably the best indicator that these are indeed ingested pollen grains: The common fig is pollinated by an elaborate symbiosis with a particular species of a two millimeter long wasp (Blastophaga psenes); the flowers are practically invisible, as they bloom inside the syconium (Galil and Neeman, 1977).

Therefore, the common fig is usually extremely under-represented in pollen spectra.

The appearance of fig pollen within this assemblage may indicate that the entire fruit was consumed.

PARAGRAPH

The palynological spectrum of Samples 3 and 4 (sediments taken slightly below the yellowish fibrous material), most probably represent a mixture of ingested pollen grains that were derived more or less equally from plants that were consumed, and pollen that represents a natural “background” spectrum.

According to Bryant (1974b) the occurrence of pollen grains of non-edible zoophilous plants which are usually under-represented in palynological assemblages probably indicate, in this type of context, accidental ingestion rather than intentional diets: the grains could have settled on prepared foods, accidentally been inhaled, or been trapped in drinking water sources.

Based on the relatively good state of pollen preservation in Samples 1–4 (in comparison to the almost pollen barren Samples 6 and 7), it is clear that a different depositional environment characterized the yellowish fibrous material and the sediments below it.

This unique depositional environment is also evident from the petrographic microscopy analysis.

In regard to phytoliths, while Samples 3 and 4 were characterized by relatively high phytolith concentrations, within the yellowish fibrous material only a few phytolith were observed, which probably penetrated due to a mix with the below sediments.

PARAGRAPH

Pollen is introduced into the intestinal tract through the consumption of flowers, foliage which includes buds and flowers, seeds and fruits of certain types and drinking teas derived from foliage or flowers (Adams, 1980; Reinhard et al., 1991).

The presence of pollen of grape in fecal material may result from the consumption of grapes, raisins or wine, as all these can contain considerable amounts of pollen (e.g., Greig, 1982).

Olive pollen in feces may result from the consumption of olives or olive oil.

Samples 1–4 contained high frequencies of cereal pollen.

Most cereals are self-pollinated, thus a large number of pollen grains are found in the hulls (Deforce, 2010 and references therein).

Therefore, high values of cereal pollen are common in cess deposits and are explained by the consumption of cereal-based food (e.g., Deforce, 2010).

PARAGRAPH

As seen in the analysis of the modern pollen rain (Sample 5), high percentages of wind pollinated taxa are a characteristic feature of surface soils in the region (e.g., Horowitz, 1979).

The almost total lack of pollen from edible/potable plants in this sample points to the unique character of the other four samples.

Previous studies show that zoophilous plants in soils from non-cultural zones of archaeological sites, alluvial sediments, or surface soil samples account for 2–4% of the palynological spectra (Bryant, 1969; Reinhard et al., 1991).

Therefore, it seems that the most probable source of high zoophilous pollen ratios in Samples 1–4 is through floral or inflorescence ingestion.

Drinks or teas made from (or dishes that included) myrtle, mint, chamomile, nettle and sage flowers or foliage could also have been an important source of the zoophilous pollen found in these samples.

Another potential source which can explain the variety of the pollen taxa is the consumption of honey (e.g., Deforce, 2010).

Honey contains high concentrations of zoophilous pollen since it is collected by honeybees from floral sources in the process of honey production (e.g., Bryant and Jones, 2001).

PARAGRAPH

The paleoparasitological analysis retrieved only one possible egg of whipworm from the fecal matter in Locus 12/H/75.

The practical absence of parasite markers could be due either to taphonomic processes, i.e., poor preservation of organic matter, or lack of deposition.

Given the excellent preservation of plant tissue, lipid biomarkers, and pollen grains in the studied feature, we propose that the fecal material studied here was not produced by parasite-inflicted individuals.

SECTION

The uniqueness of the palynological assemblage

PARAGRAPH

Martin and Sharrock (1964) were among the first to conduct pollen analysis of human feces remains.

They showed that ingested pollen tends to be preserved relatively well in this type of material.

Their study provided information on prehistoric diets and insights into the cultural usage of specific plants, such as the possible medicinal use of different types of herbal teas.

The reconstruction of diet in ancient Near Eastern sites is mainly based on the extraction and identification of macro-botanical remains such as seeds, grains and fruits (e.g., Zohary et al., 2012) and on animal bone remains (e.g., Brian and Wapnish, 1985).

By using these approaches only, the reconstructed diet is partial and does not give the full picture.

Specifically, beverages are usually under-represented in dietary reconstructions and the ability to trace the use of medicinal plants is very limited, when reconstructions are based on macro-botanical remains only.

This is not surprising as several useful plants, especially herbs and spices, can only be recovered in the form of pollen because they are harvested before producing seeds, or because only soft and perishable vegetative parts of the plants are used (e.g., Deforce, 2010).

PARAGRAPH

Palynological analysis is not routinely conducted in most archaeological excavations, at least not in the Near East, due to preservation issues and relatively high costs.

The unique conditions in the cesspit, which is probably characterized by relatively low oxygen levels, led to the good state of the pollen preservation.

It enables us to suggest that several plants were consumed as beverages (probably herbal teas).

Interestingly they all had medicinal qualities when imbibed.

Since wormwood is a wind pollinated taxon we put it in the group of plants which represent the natural environment, yet, wormwood, also evident by its name, is a well-known medicinal plant (palynologically only distinguished to the genus level).

Additionally it is absent from the palynological spectrum of the recent pollen rain (Sample 5).

Some of these plants could have also been used as condiments (e.g., mint, chamomile) or in various dishes (mint, salvia, myrtle, and nettle).

PARAGRAPH

The case of the myrtle is particularly interesting since it is mentioned in one of the Amarna letters (EA 22: III 29–35; Moran, 1992:55), which are contemporary with Stratum H-14, when Canaan, Megiddo included, was under Egyptian rule.

Myrtle is not native to the Egyptian flora (e.g., Boulos, 2005) and did not grow there before being introduced by humans.

It is evident from the Amarna letter that myrtle oil were sent as gifts from Mittani to Egypt (Moran, 1992:55).

Remains of myrtle were also recovered from Area H at Megiddo – identified in charcoal in the slightly later Level H-12, dated to the Late Bronze Age III/early Iron I (Benzaquen and Langgut, forthcoming).

From exactly the same period, pollen of myrtle was extracted from a grinding stone found in Area K at Megiddo (04/K/26 is K-6 or K-5); Weinstein-Evron et al. (forthcoming), suggested that myrtle leaves may have been crushed on these grinding stones for medicinal uses.

Indeed, ethnographical studies show that different parts of the myrtle plant are used for medicinal purposes (Sumbul et al., 2011).

PARAGRAPH

Martin and Sharrock (1964) in their pioneering study also showed that in addition to diet reconstruction, the pollen data can also be used to reveal seasonality of site occupation.

In the case of Megiddo's cesspit, since the analyzed palynological assemblages include plants that bloom during different seasons, it is proposed that the use of the facility was not limited to a certain season, and that the accumulation of this deposit represents at least one year of use.

SECTION

Archaeological considerations and implications

PARAGRAPH

Identification of cess deposits/latrines in the southern Levant has usually been based on structural features (e.g., stone toilet seats); in some cases the studies have been accompanied by paleoparasitology analysis (mainly the occurrence of parasite eggs and cysts).

Examples from the southern Levant for such facilities during the Bronze and Iron Ages include the Late Bronze Age latrines at Hazor (Fink, 2009: n. 9), Late Bronze Age cesspit at Tell el-Ajjul (Petrie, 1932) and several Iron Age latrines in Jerusalem and its vicinity (De Groot and Bernick-Greenberg, 2012:72–73 and references therein).

At north Levantine sites such facilities are attested as far back as the third millennium BCE (e.g., Tell Beydar and Hamoukar – Van der Stede, 2003; Lebeau, 2005).

Their existence and evolution are clearly linked to the development of complex societies.

From the second-millennium BCE such facilities are known for example from palaces and private houses at Mari, Ugarit and Nuzi (Fink, 2009 and references therein).

The most impressive among these ancient installations are the Late Bronze Age latrine facilities found in the Level VII palace at Tell Atchana (Alalakh) (Woolley, 1955; Yener et al., 2004a; 2004b, 2005).

According to Fink (2009), the Tell Atchana installations are the earliest flush toilets known thus far in the region.

It is noteworthy that before the Roman period almost all latrine facilities from the region were found in palatial contexts or in buildings that imitate regal luxury (Fink, 2009; McMahon, 2015).

As noted above, the Megiddo cesspit was located inside a building.

According to Fink (2009), the latrines in Tell Atchana (Alalah) were located inside buildings; owing to the special architectural features that characterize them, they entailed considerable engineering proficiency prior to construction of the building, e.g., installation of drains, toilet basins or foot-stands, channels running under floors and through walls, waterproof walls and floors, and cesspits.

PARAGRAPH

As shown above, the identification of latrines in the archaeological record in the region is primary based on structural features (e.g., stone toilet seats).

In some cases nearby cess deposits were subjected to parasite analysis.

That means that in cases when the structural features are not indicative and/or parasite remains were not preserved, as in the current study, these installations could have been missed or misidentified.

Our study demonstrates several types of analyses that can be carried out in order to determine the presence of cess deposits in the archaeological record.

In addition, conducting a palynological investigation in cesspits, latrines and other types of waste deposits is highly recommended since, as this study demonstrates, pollen analyses of such contexts may provide significant additional information on former plant use, which in most cases cannot be obtained through the study of macro botanical remains.

Prior to this study, only one investigation in Israel of such a facility involved a palynological analysis, which produced limited results (Cahill et al., 1991).

In contrast, in other regions around the globe such analysis is much more common (for example Bryant, 1974a, 1974b; Bryant and Williams-Dean, 1975; Bryant et al., 2012; Deforce, 2006, 2010; Greig, 1981, 1982, 1994; Horrocks and Best, 2004; Knights et al., 1983; Kuijper and Turner, 1992; Reinhard et al., 1991).

Incidentally, in a recent study that aimed at defining a potential “indicator package” for identification of cesspits in the archaeological record (Smith, 2013), use of methods such as infrared spectroscopy, petrographic microscopy and lipid analyses – as suggested in this study – are not listed.

PARAGRAPH

The Megiddo cesspit is among the earliest found in the southern Levant.

It is located in close proximity to the Late Bronze Age palace (Fig. 4; Area AA Stratum VIII – Loud, 1948 Fig. 382); the remains in Area H can be interpreted as an auxiliary (administrative) structure near the palace, or a residency connected to the family of the ruler or his entourage.

The other two Late Bronze toilets known from ancient Israel also derive from palatial contexts: several cesspits connected by drains and an ex situ stone toilet seat from Area M at Hazor (Fink, 2009 n. 9) and a cesspit from Tell el-Ajjul (Petrie, 1932).

Canaan of the time was a province of Egypt and Megiddo was the hub of a city-state under Egyptian domination.

Stone toilet seats are known from 14th century BCE Tell el-Amarna (Brovarski et al., 1982), the capital of Amenophis IV (Akhenaton), one of the two pharaohs of the Amarna tablets, possibly the addressee of at least some of the Biridiya letters from Megiddo.

Based on the comprehensive analyses presented here, we suggest that the yellowish fibrous feature identified at Megiddo, composed of phosphatized vegetal matter and surrounded by pebbles with phosphatized rims (the brown crusts) on their upper part, is an in situ anthropogenic installation.

These brown crusts were formed by the reaction of phosphate-rich solutions with the calcium available on the surface of these pebbles (i.e., a phosphate reaction rim, sensu Weiner et al., 1993), which means that the source of phosphate came from above.

The yellowish phosphatized vegetal material is degraded fecal matter.

The preservation of organic compounds characteristic of fecal material (such as cholesterol and coprostanol), some of which are also present in human feces, and the presence in relatively high ratios of pollen from edible/potable plants, strengthens our identification of the structure as a cesspit.

This observation is also corroborated by the limited size of the feature, meaning that the find is unlikely to represent remains of animal dung.

The installation was recovered from a stratum dated to the Late Bronze IIA (14th century BCE).

It is therefore among the earliest evidence of a cesspit identified thus far in ancient Canaan/Israel, together with such facilities unearthed at Hazor and Tell el-Ajjul; in all three cases, the installations were located in palatial areas and were therefore probably used by members of ruling groups.

This study demonstrates how several different complementing micro-archaeological methods can help to identify an unfamiliar material found in an excavation.

Furthermore, it shows how small and macroscopically unattractive archaeological features can yield a wealth of information about the past.

The micro-archaeological indicators presented in this study are not limited to the Levant and are applicable at other sites around the globe.

The palynological analyses of this unique context provide additional information about the ancient vegetative diet of Megiddo's inhabitants and the use of medicinal plants; this information may not have been obtainable through the study of macro botanical remains.
