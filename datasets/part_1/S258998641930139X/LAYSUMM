TITLE

Making the switch: From case studies to N-of-1 trials

PARAGRAPH

Case studies generate new ideas and offer guidance for patients with uncommon diseases.

However, case studies are prone to factors that can influence study outcomes.

N-of-1 trials minimize this bias by borrowing concepts from randomized controlled trials.

N-of-1 trials are a double-blinded randomized cross-over trial within a limited number of patients, often as small as a single patient.

These trials are best used for management of chronic diseases and therapies with quick onset and offset, such as in patients receiving therapy for epilepsy.
