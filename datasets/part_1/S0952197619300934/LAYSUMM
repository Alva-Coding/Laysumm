TITLE

A bounded actor–critic reinforcement learning algorithm applied to airline revenue management

PARAGRAPH

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an artificial intelligence technique which, like the human brain, works on feedback gathered from trials and errors.

The actor-critic is a type of RL algorithm in which one of the algorithm’s parameters, called the actors, become very large in magnitude, causing the computer to crash.

Therefore, this algorithm fails on large-scale industrial-strength cases.

We develop a new actor-critic algorithm in which the computer crash is avoided, allowing the algorithm to deliver solutions on large-scale problems.

We test the algorithm on large-scale airline pricing problems, where it performs better than a very popular industrial technique called EMSR-b.
