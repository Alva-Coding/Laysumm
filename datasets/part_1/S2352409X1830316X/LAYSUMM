TITLE

Punic black-gloss ware in Nora (south-western Sardinia, Italy): Production and provenance

PARAGRAPH

The archaeometric study of the Punic black-gloss ware found in Nora (south-western Sardinia, Italy) indicates that two different productions coexisted at the site between the IV century and the II century BC.

On the basis of the petrographic and chemical analysis, both productions were imported from the northern African area and from the western Sardinia (Tharros), respectively, and are characterised by quite similar production choices, also in terms of firing temperatures.

This can be interpreted as the integration into the Sardinia traditions of the Punic influences, which gave life to regional productions.
