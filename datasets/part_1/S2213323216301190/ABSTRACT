ABSTRACT

TITLE

Spiders, ladybugs and bees: A case of unusual sensations in a child with cingulate epilepsy

PARAGRAPH

Cingulate epilepsy is a rare form of epilepsy.

Seizures from the anterior cingulate may present with mood change, fear, hypermotor activity, and autonomic signs, while posterior cingulate seizures resemble temporal lobe seizures.

We describe a child with cingulate epilepsy who experienced unpleasant/painful sensory phenomenon.

The sensations were described as spiders crawling on his forehead/right leg, ladybugs causing right ear pain and bees stinging his head/right extremities.

Unpleasant sensory phenomenon/pain are rarely reported in cingulate epilepsy.

Recognizing the role of the cingulate in producing pain/unusual sensory phenomenon is important, and may have localizing value when evaluating children for epilepsy surgery.
