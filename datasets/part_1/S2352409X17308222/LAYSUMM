TITLE

Late Holocene plant use in the Sierras Pampeanas of Argentina: Evidence from phytoliths and starch grains

PARAGRAPH

This papper presents new information about the presence of cultigens in the Sierras Pampeanas of Argentina during the late Holocene.

A wide variety of wild species was used in this period along with Zea mays (corn), Cucurbita sp. (squash), undifferentiated tubers, and Phaseolus sp. (beans), identified by the presence of microremains in knapped tools.

The obtained data allow discussing the diversity of the resources utilized and the importance of cultigens in prehispanic times in a context that is currently considered the southern limit of prehispanic food production economies.
