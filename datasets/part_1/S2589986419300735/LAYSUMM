TITLE

The impact of cannabis use on intracarotid amobarbital testing

PARAGRAPH

Self-reported consumption of cannabis is relatively common in patients with epilepsy.

The impact of chronic cannabis use on Wada (intracarotid amobarbital) testing (IAT), to localize speech and memory functions in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery, has not previously been described.

We present a case series of patients who were chronic cannabis users and underwent IAT both before and after a period of enforced abstinence.

These cases demonstrate a need for prospective studies that more formally assess the impact of cannabis use on IAT.

Of particular interest may be the impact of cannabis products with varying ratios of canabidiol (CBD) toÂ tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
