TITLE

Ancient starch analysis of grinding stones from Kokatha Country, South Australia

PARAGRAPH

Residue analysis of 25 grinding stones from surface contexts in arid South Australia identified starch grains and collagen.

Survival of starch in marginal environments is rare, in this case only 7 of the grinding stones retained residues.

Two species with underground storage organs –Typha and Crinum spp were identified by geometric morphometric analysis.

Both species are recorded as used by Aboriginal people, the latter as a medicinal treatment.

These finds are consistent with accounts of this location as a men’s ceremonial site and the seasonal timing (mid-summer).

Furthermore, it highlights the resilient nature of starch residues in extreme environmental settings.
