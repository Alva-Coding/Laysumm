TITLE

A harmony search variant and a useful constraint handling method for the dynamic economic emission dispatch problems considering transmission loss

PARAGRAPH

From the point of view of economic benefit and environmental protection, dynamic economic emission dispatch problem (DEED) serves to save power generation cost and reduce emission pollutants while satisfying four kinds of practical constraints such as generator capacity, power balance, generating unit ramp-rate and spinning reserve.

We combine an improved heuristic algorithm and a constraint handling method to schedule the power outputs of NG generating units over T time intervals for DEED.

Accordingly, an optimal combination of power outputs can be determined in a short period of time, and it contributes to both cost saving and pollutants reduction of DEED.
