TITLE

Early Bronze Age painted wares from Tell el-'Abd, Syria: A compositional and technological study

PARAGRAPH

The ‘Euphrates Monochrome Painted Ware’ is a ceramic style attested along the Middle Euphrates in northern Syria at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age, ca. 2900 – 2700 BCE.

Despite this ware has been extensively studied from a typological perspective, its technology was never characterised.

We apply a combination of macroscopic observations, ceramic petrography and micro X-ray diffraction (μ-XRD2) to study the material from Tell el-‘Abd, a small mound now beneath the modern Lake Assad (North Syria).

The results allow to elucidate the provenance and manufacture of this ware, and to define the pigments used for the painted decoration.
