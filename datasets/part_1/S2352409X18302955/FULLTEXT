TITLE

Radiocarbon dating legacy collections: A Bayesian analysis of high-precision AMS 14C dates from the Par-Tee site, Oregon

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Museum-based archaeological research offers access to unique archaeological materials sometimes unobtainable through modern studies—a result of the often large-scale of late-nineteenth and early twentieth-century excavations.

Although concerns of decreasing museum repository space are increasing (Bawaya, 2007), anthropological research of museum collections is addressing a diverse range of anthropological, biological, and conservation issues (Sholts et al., 2016).

Collections-based studies, however, can be complicated by the differential excavation, recovery, and curation histories of museum collections (Bawaya, 2007; Pearce, 1994).

As Luby et al. (2013) note, these early museum assemblages endure as legacy collections rather than as “old” excavation materials.

The term legacy highlights the inherent value and the importance of museum collections from the perspective of stewardship, research, and education.

PARAGRAPH

Prior to initiating museum-based studies on legacy collections, conservation, rehousing, and basic inventorying of an assemblage may need to be completed—potentially deterring researchers from museum studies (Luby et al., 2013).

Museum-based research also requires understanding museum-specific catalog systems, collections processing, and field sampling strategies, the availability of associated field notes and photographs, and deaccessioning practices (Huster, 2013; Luby et al., 2013; Voss, 2012).

Despite these and other obstacles, analysis of archaeological museum collections is an important pursuit, where large collections can be analyzed on their own, or supplement new excavations at a site (Crowell, 2000; Luby et al., 2013; Rick, 2007).

PARAGRAPH

One of the biggest issues when conducting museum-based research—and in archaeology more generally—is establishing the chronology of an assemblage or site (Buck et al., 1991; Finstad et al., 2013; Schweikhardt et al., 2011).

Frequently in legacy collections, older radiocarbon (14C) measurements were made on composite or bulk samples of charcoal, shell, or bone.

Often, samples were not corrected for isotopic fractionation; isotopic ratios were estimated rather than measured, or dates have high standard deviations that make them problematic for building chronologies (Ashmore, 1999; Bronk Ramsey et al., 2004; Stuiver and Polach, 1977; Taylor, 1991).

After proper chronometric hygiene assessments of existing 14C dates, it is often desirable for archaeologists to obtain new AMS dates for sites, building potentially higher resolution chronological sequences of legacy collections (Kennett et al., 2014; Luby et al., 2013).

Bayesian analysis of high-precision AMS 14C dates provides an important framework for enhancing the interpretation of existing collections and increasing their broader value to the scientific community (Bronk Ramsey et al., 2004; Jew et al., 2015; Kennett et al., 2011; Thulman, 2017).

PARAGRAPH

In this paper we present the results of recent, high-resolution AMS 14C dating and Bayesian analysis for the Par-Tee site (35CLT20), which produced a large archaeological collection from the northern Oregon Coast.

The Par-Tee assemblage includes ~7000 artifacts, including bone and antler tools, as well as a massive collection of faunal materials from nearly 300 excavation units that make it one of the most intensively excavated sites along the Pacific Coast of the Americas (Colten, 2002, 2015; Losey and Yang, 2007; Phebus Jr. and Drucker, 1979; Sanchez et al., 2016; Wellman et al., 2017).

We selected thick and dense cortical bone fragments, presumably from cervids, for 14C dating due to their excellent preservation and widespread distribution throughout the site.

Previous research suggests that elk (Cervus sp.) and deer (Odocoileus sp.) dominate the Par-Tee terrestrial mammal remains (Colten, 2002, 2015) and represent the primary raw material in the bone and antler tool assemblage (Losey and Yang, 2007; Sanchez et al., 2016).

The cervid samples were also selected for dating because they are non-diagnostic fragments whose destruction would not hinder future zooarchaeological analysis.

We conducted collagen peptide mass fingerprinting, also known as Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS), for each specimen to ensure that only cervids were included in the revised chronology, obviating uncertainties associated with local marine reservoir offsets.

Our analysis integrates 14C dating and ZooMS to refine the Par-Tee site chronology and anchor subsistence, technological, and other analyses of the collection.

The archaeology of the northern Oregon Coast

PARAGRAPH

The northern Oregon Coast is part of the Pacific Northwest Coast Culture Area, which encompasses the region from Cape Mendocino in Northern California to Yakutat Bay, Alaska (Drucker, 1955; Goddard, 1945).

The section of the Oregon Coast near the mouth of the Columbia River and south along the Clatsop Plains is an area culturally associated with the Chinookan speaking Clatsop and the Salish speaking Tillamook (Jacobs, 2003; Silverstein, 1990).

Late Holocene age occupations predominate the archaeology of the Clatsop Plains.

The late Holocene residential pattern of the Lower Columbia and northern Oregon Coast is commonly associated with permanent to semi-permanent villages inhabited during a majority of the year and for extended periods of time (Aikens et al., 2011).

These residences were likely supported by storage-based economies (Aikens et al., 2011; Ames, 2003).

Complex social institutions like those observed during and after European contact are considered one of the hallmarks of the late Holocene cultural manifestations of the region (Aikens et al., 2011; Ames, 2003).

PARAGRAPH

In Seaside, Oregon, three sites have been the focus of archaeological research: Par-Tee, Palmrose (35CLT47), and Avenue Q (34CLT13).

George Phebus of the Smithsonian Institution and avocational archaeologist Robert Drucker excavated the three sites from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s (Phebus Jr. and Drucker, 1973, 1979).

Subsequent excavations at Palmrose and Avenue Q were conducted by the Oregon State Museum of Anthropology, University of Oregon (Connolly, 1992).

Based on the previous research, Palmrose was occupied from about 2335–1745 cal BC to cal AD 50–535 (Connolly, 1992), Avenue Q from 1925–‐1225 cal BC to cal AD 690–995 (Connolly, 1992), and Par-Tee from 350 cal BC to cal AD 1150 (Losey and Yang, 2007; Sanchez et al., 2016).

PARAGRAPH

Palmrose is recognized to contain one of the earliest known large plank houses on the southern Northwest Coast, its estimated size being 12 × 6 m (Aikens et al., 2011; Ames and Maschner, 1999; Connolly, 1992).

The plank house appears to have been built and rebuilt several times from 800 BC to AD 400 (Ames and Maschner, 1999).

The Palmrose site produced a diverse artifact and faunal assemblage that includes a number of zoomorphic and anthropomorphic carved bone and antler artifacts (Aikens et al., 2011; Connolly, 1992).

While faunal remains from the Palmrose collection excavated by Phebus and Drucker were formerly controlled by private individuals, it is currently curated at the Museum of Natural and Cultural History, University of Oregon.

PARAGRAPH

Avenue Q appears to post-date the Palmrose occupation.

No residential structures are known from the site, perhaps a result of the small-scale of the excavations and historic impacts related to city development.

Analysis of mollusk shells from Palmrose and Avenue Q suggest that horse clam (Tresus capax), butter clam (Saxidomus giganteus), and littleneck clam (Protothaca staminea) were constituents of the shell middens (Connolly, 1995).

Connolly (1995) demonstrated that the mollusks indicate the former presence of an estuary nonexistent today due to the prograding coastline associated with the formation and growth of the Clatsop Plains.

SECTION

Archaeological investigations at Par-Tee

PARAGRAPH

The Par-Tee site is located in the city of Seaside, south of the Columbia River mouth at the southern extent of the Clatsop Plains (Fig. 1).

Phebus and Drucker's excavations at Par-Tee included the excavation of at least 256 5 × 5 ft wide test units (~550 m2), dug in 1 ft arbitrary levels, with recovery of materials from excavated sediments screened over ¼ in sieves (Colten, 2002, 2015; Losey and Power, 2005; Losey and Yang, 2007; Phebus Jr. and Drucker, 1973, 1979).

PARAGRAPH

Par-Tee is the largest Northwest Coast archaeological collection south of the Ozette site in Washington.

Estimates suggest half of all artifacts collected during controlled excavations on the Oregon Coast originate from the Par-Tee site (Colten, 2015; Losey and Power, 2005; Lyman, 1991).

Despite the presence of the extensive collections, the Par-Tee site remains only partially reported (Lyman, 1991; Phebus Jr. and Drucker, 1973, 1979) with the majority of case-studies published in the last two decades and the vast majority of the collection never reported on (Colten, 2002, 2015; Losey and Power, 2005; Losey and Yang, 2007; Sanchez et al., 2016; Wellman et al., 2017).

The Par-Tee assemblage has been housed at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History since the 1970s and has been the subject of intensive Smithsonian collections care and preservation work that includes rehousing, decompressing, cataloging, and the identification of all faunal materials to general class (i.e., bird, fish, and mammal).

PARAGRAPH

Previous studies differ in their interpretations regarding the duration, seasonality, and use of the Par-Tee site by indigenous people.

At present, archaeologists interpret the Par-Tee site as a village that was occupied year-round (Arbolino et al., 2005).

This interpretation is supported by vertebrate faunal analyses from the site that documented a variety of fishes, mammals, and birds, likely harvested during multiple seasons of the year (Colten, 2002).

Based on ethnographic and ethnohistorical accounts, Minor (1983) proposed that Seaside village sites, including Par-Tee, were inhabited during the fall salmon-fishing season as part of broader seasonal shifts in the indigenous settlement-subsistence patterns of the Northern Oregon Coast.

According to the model, people alternated fishing grounds from the lower Columbia River, in the summer, to the Clatsop Plains in the fall.

However, recent research supports the interpretation of Par-Tee as a semi-sedentary and year-round occupation (Arbolino et al., 2005; Colten, 2002).

PARAGRAPH

The Par-Tee artifact assemblage includes >7000 artifacts, including projectile points and other flaked stone tools, 23 whale bone atlatls and atlatl fragments, antler digging stick handles and a diverse set of bone harpoon heads, composite toggling harpoons, and unilateral and bilateral barbed points (Losey, 2010; Moss, 2011).

The assemblage also contains an assortment of awls and bone needles that possibly indicate the production of fishing nets, basket making, weaving, and sewing (Losey, 2010; Moss, 2011).

The interpretation that woodworking occurred is supported by the presence of bone and antler handles for attaching adze blades in addition to the presence of used basalt spall choppers, elk antler wedges, and chisels and adzes produced from elk metapodials (Losey, 2010; Moss, 2011).

The assemblage also holds a number of zoomorphic and anthropomorphic items as well as embellished artifacts such as incised bone and antler tools (Losey, 2010; Moss, 2011).

Lastly, several pendant-like items from the site have carefully incised geometric designs and perforations including a perforated sturgeon (Acipenser sp.) opercle (Losey, 2010).

PARAGRAPH

According to Arbolino et al. (2005), following the primary shell midden forming occupation of Par-Tee, people utilized the site as a burial ground.

The majority of burials at Par-Tee post-date the primary shell midden forming occupation based on previously reported 14C and stratigraphic data.

The human burials were shallow, flexed inhumations that were interred in the shell midden after site abandonment (Arbolino et al., 2005).

Historic era artifacts support the presence of an even more recent occupation (post 1888).

These include a bone handled pocket knife, square cut nails, Euro-American and Eurasian refined earthenware and porcelain ceramics, and other historic era artifacts.

Ceramics produced by the George Jones' Stoke-on-Trent were manufactured around 1864–1873 and a J&G Meakin ceramic fragment was produced around 1888–1891 (Kowalsky and Kowalsky, 1999).

Therefore, the site appears to have three occupations, the primary shell midden, the later mortuary component, and a late 19th century historic era occupation.

SECTION

Radiocarbon dating: previously reported and unreported dates

PARAGRAPH

Previous reports present 33 14C dates for the Par-Tee site.

Conventional radiometric 14C dating suggests that the occupation of Par-Tee occurred over a period of roughly 1500 years, between approximately 350 cal BC and cal AD 1150 (2300–800 cal BP) (Arbolino et al., 2005; Colten, 2002; Losey and Yang, 2007; Sanchez et al., 2016).

These dates derive from research spanning the last four decades.

Significant advancements in 14C dating warrant a reanalysis of the earliest dates reported.

PARAGRAPH

Previous work by Smithsonian researchers reported 25 14C dates (Arbolino et al., 2005; Phebus Jr. and Drucker, 1979).

Six high-resolution AMS dates were published by Losey and Yang (2007) and two dates were obtained by Sanchez et al. (2016).

The majority of 14C samples submitted by Phebus and Drucker (n = 24) were on large, composite charcoal samples.

In the preparation of at least three charcoal samples (SI-653, SI-654, and SI-655) base pretreatment (e.g. NaOH, KOH washes) was not conducted, resulting in the potential inclusion of humates, affecting the reliability of the reported dates.

In addition, of the 25 dates submitted by Phebus and Drucker, direct δ13C measurements were made for only two charcoal samples.

In the case of one sample of human remains, δ13C was estimated rather than measured and the collagen yield was not reported.

All but one of the uncalibrated ages falls between about 2055 ± 145 BP and 1000 ± 65 BP, with a single outlier (SI-588) at 3140 ± 100 BP (see Appendix 1).

Five excavation units (SE10L, SW20G, NE12G, NE12F, and NE14G) had multiple 14C dates and chronological reversals appear in all but one of these units (NE14G).

PARAGRAPH

Six dates reported by Losey and Yang (2007) derive from one excavation unit (SE10L) and were AMS 14C dates obtained on single marine shell samples taken from precise locations—2-inch horizontal bands of sediment.

The marine shells correspond with charcoal samples dated by Phebus and Drucker and provide an additional evaluation of their dates.

Six marine shell samples, two Saxidomus giganteus (butter clam) and four Protothaca staminea (Pacific littleneck clam) were submitted to Beta Analytic Inc. for AMS dating, with δ13C measured on an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS).

The conventional ages of these samples ranged only 200 14C years despite being derived from deposits spanning at least 62 in (157.5 cm) of apparently well-stratified midden deposits (Table 1).

Several samples from different depths produced identical dates and one chronological and stratigraphic reversal.

PARAGRAPH

Sanchez et al. (2016) reported two AMS 14C dates, one for a humpback whale phalanx and the other from an elk bone harpoon tip embedded in the whale bone.

The whale bone and harpoon tip came from the southwest site area from unit 21F level 4.

Calibrating the 14C date from the elk bone suggests that opportunistic whaling potentially occurred on the northern Oregon Coast around cal AD 430–550 (see Losey and Yang, 2007).

The date from the humpback whale phalanx produced an age of 2120 ± 15 14C yr BP with estimated marine reservoir offsets between 210 ± 36 14C yr to 220 ± 37 14C yr, providing a date of cal AD 400–610 (Sanchez et al., 2016:401–402).

PARAGRAPH

The 25 radiocarbon dates obtained by Phebus and Drucker present numerous interpretative challenges.

First, as previously discussed, composite samples of wood are unreliable due to the combination of separate entities, resulting in the dating of multiple events rather than more discrete cultural activities (Ashmore, 1999).

Second, in Pacific Northwest rainforests, long-lived trees and drift logs were commonly a source of fuel, so dates of multiple unidentified charcoal fragments are likely significantly offset by in-built age and/or the ‘old wood’ effect (Dee and Ramsey, 2014; Kennett et al., 2002; Sanchez et al., 2016; Schiffer, 1986).

Third, samples that lack stable carbon isotope measurements are prone to inaccuracies and it is unclear precisely how these were measured, raising questions about correcting these dates.

Lastly, several of these dates have large standard deviations (>100 years) that raise additional questions about their accuracy.

For all these reasons, in re-examining the potential age range for Par-Tee site human occupation, we follow basic principles of chronometric hygiene (Fitzpatrick and Jew, 2018; Hunt and Lipo, 2006; Pettitt et al., 2003; Spriggs, 1989; Wilmshurst et al., 2011) by excluding all dates previously reported by Phebus Jr. and Drucker (1973, 1979).

In addition, we exclude previously reported 14C dates from marine organisms (Losey and Yang, 2007; Sanchez et al., 2016) to avoid uncertainties associated with corrections for regional marine reservoir effects.

SECTION

Material and methods

PARAGRAPH

The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History houses all the Par-Tee collections and materials sampled in this study.

To maintain standard sampling strategies, we rely on a new series of high-resolution 14C dates for the current study and exclude previously reported AMS 14C dates from marine organisms (Losey and Yang, 2007; Sanchez et al., 2016).

However, we include one previously reported 14C date on elk bone reported by Sanchez et al. (2016).

Fifteen bone samples from four excavation units (NE9F, NE16F, SW19D, and SE8G) from the Par-Tee assemblage were sampled for the analysis.

Rick and Sanchez selected three bone samples per unit, except for SW19D where five samples were selected and NE9F with four samples.

Individual samples derive from distinct arbitrary excavation levels.

To minimize our impact on the collection, we selected non-diagnostic long bone fragments for the study that appeared to be Cervidae remains based on cortical bone thickness or metapodial groove presence.

To our knowledge, none of the samples has ever been treated with any pesticides or other materials that may influence our results.

Rick used sterile surgical blades to remove 0.5–1 g of bone material, removing two samples from each specimen.

Subsamples were sent to the Human Paleoecology and Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University (PSU) for pretreatment and later the W.M. Keck Carbon Cycle AMS Laboratory, University of California-Irvine for AMS dating.

In addition, the PSU AMS Facility analyzed two samples for AMS dating.

The second sub-sample was sent to the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, University of Manchester for ZooMS analysis.

ZooMS methods

PARAGRAPH

Advances in faunal identification methods through molecular fingerprinting provide researchers the opportunity to limit research impacts on museum archaeological collections (Buckley et al., 2008, 2014; Collins et al., 2010; Richter et al., 2011) while maximizing data gathering potential.

Collagen peptide mass fingerprinting (i.e., ZooMS) facilitates the use of highly fragmented faunal remains in research, allowing for the molecular barcoding of archaeological samples—even those in which ancient DNA (aDNA) is no longer readily retrieved—to family, genus, and in some cases, species level identification (Rybczynski et al., 2013; Speller et al., 2016).

Collagen is the most abundant protein in bone and preserves for millions of years in some environments (Rybczynski et al., 2013).

Thus, collagen peptide mass fingerprinting allows researchers to identify highly fragmented faunal remains to better understand animals present in an assemblage, human processing, and non-cultural taphonomic factors affecting the representation of species (Buckley et al., 2017).

PARAGRAPH

ZooMS collagen fingerprinting was carried out following van der Sluis et al. (2014).

Bone powder was demineralized with 0.6 M HCl overnight and ultrafiltered into ammonium bicarbonate (50 mM) using 10 kDa molecular weight cut-off filters (Vivaspin, UK).

The retentate was then digested with 0.4 μg sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, UK) overnight at 37 °C.

Subsequently the digests were acidified to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and the peptides purified and fractionated into 10% and 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA fractions using C18 ZipTips (OMIX, UK) following Buckley et al. (2009).

After centrifugal evaporation and resuspension in 10 μL 0.1% TFA, 1 μL samples were spotted with an equal amount of α-cyano hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solution (10 mg/mL in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA) onto a Bruker stainless steel Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) target plate and allowed to air dry.

The fingerprints were then acquired using a Bruker Ultraflex II MALDI mass spectrometer with up to 2000 laser acquisitions over the mass/charge (m/z) range of 700–3700.

Spectra were compared with those of previous publications (e.g., Buckley and Kansa, 2011; Buckley et al., 2010, 2017) for identification by matching selected peptide markers.

SECTION

AMS methods

PARAGRAPH

At PSU, bone collagen was extracted and purified using the modified Longin method with ultrafiltration (Brown et al., 1988; Hoggarth et al., 2014).

Samples (200–400 mg) were demineralized for 24–36 h in 0.5 N HCl at 5 °C, followed by a brief (<1 h) alkali bath in 0.1 N NaOH at room temperature to remove humates.

The pseudomorph was rinsed to neutrality in multiple changes of 18.2 MΩ H2O, and then gelatinized for 10 h at 60 °C in 0.01 N HCl.

Gelatin solution was pipetted into precleaned Centriprep® 30 ultrafilters (retaining >30 kDa molecular weight gelatin) and centrifuged three times for 20 min, diluted with 18.2 MΩ H2O and centrifuged three more times for 20 min to desalt the solution.

More detailed ultrafilter cleaning methods are described in (McClure et al., 2010).

Ultrafiltered collagen was lyophilized and weighed to determine percent yield as a first evaluation of the degree of bone collagen preservation.

Carbon and nitrogen concentrations and stable isotope ratios were measured at the PSU Light Isotope Laboratory with a Costech EA (ECS 4010), Thermo Finnigan Conflo IV gas handling device, and a Thermo Finnigan Delta V analyzer.

Sample quality was evaluated by % crude gelatin yield, %C, %N, and C:N ratios before AMS 14C dating.

C:N ratios for the samples were around 3.43 to 3.26, indicating good collagen preservation (DeNiro, 1985; van Klinken, 1999).

14C samples (~2.5 mg) were combusted for 3 h at 900 °C in vacuum-sealed quartz tubes with CuO wire and Ag wire.

Sample CO2 was sent to W.M. Keck Carbon Cycle AMS facility at the University of California-Irvine (UCIAMS) or the PSU AMS Facility (PSUAMS), where it was reduced to graphite at 550 °C using H2 and a Fe catalyst, with reaction water drawn off with Mg(ClO4)2 (Santos et al., 2004).

Graphite samples were pressed into targets in Al cathodes and loaded on the target wheel for AMS analysis.

14C ages were corrected for mass-dependent fractionation with measured δ13C values on the AMS (Stuiver and Polach, 1977) and compared with samples of Pleistocene whale bone (background, >50 ka BP), late Holocene bison bone (~1850 14C BP), late AD 1800s cow bone, and OXII oxalic acid standards.

Bayesian statistical modeling

PARAGRAPH

Bayesian approaches to constructing archaeological chronologies incorporate prior information regarding the archaeological site(s) and regional culture histories in the formulation of models (Bayliss and Ramsey, 2004; Bayliss et al., 2007; Kennett et al., 2011).

Thus, new data are analyzed in a framework within the context of prior knowledge (Bayliss et al., 2007).

For our analysis, 14C dates were calibrated using the IntCal13 calibration curve (Reimer et al., 2013) and models developed in OxCal 4.3 (Bronk Ramsey, 1995).

Bayesian analysis in OxCal allows researchers to situate dated events into models defining a sequence, a phase(s), and statistically calculate terminus ante quem and terminus post quem dates and their span when considering the chronology of a site or of specific events (Bayliss et al., 2007; Bronk Ramsey, 1995; Hamilton and Krus, 2018).

Two statistics calculated in OxCal aid in the assessment of the reliability of a model: indices of agreement and convergence.

For each dated sample in the models generated by OxCal, an agreement index is calculated.

An overall agreement index for the model itself is also determined calculated from the individual agreement indices (Bayliss et al., 2007).

As Bronk Ramsey (1995) notes, model agreement indices should not fall below 60%.

If the index of agreement falls below 60% (analogous to 0.05 significance level in a Χ2 test), the 14C results or the model is problematic (Bayliss et al., 2007).

Therefore, agreement indices allow researchers to test for unreliable models or dates (Bayliss et al., 2007; Bronk Ramsey, 1995).

PARAGRAPH

Kennett et al. (2011) suggest five considerations in model building.

These include precise stratigraphic excavation and selection of 14C samples, selection of short-lived organisms for dating, proper protocols of sample processing, understanding the taphonomic processes affecting sites and samples, and application of the appropriate model type and settings.

A limitation of working with museum collections, especially those resulting from coarse-grained excavation methods compared to modern excavation practices, is that precise stratigraphic relationships may not be known or recorded and taphonomic processes affecting the site unspecified.

However, OxCal provides a means to construct models to test a priori knowledge of the site and refine pre-existing concepts.

PARAGRAPH

Bayesian analysis provides an opportunity to create a revised chronology for the Par-Tee site and more reliable estimates for the duration of occupation.

In creating models for the site, we assumed that all deposits were in undisturbed stratigraphic order.

To test this assumption and the stratigraphic integrity of the site and 14C samples we first created simple calibration models for individual excavation units during the first iteration of dating.

14C dates were placed in a sequence in OxCal with boundary start and end dates calculated.

Results

SECTION

ZooMS analysis

PARAGRAPH

ZooMS analysis confirmed that all but one of the 15 bone samples selected were from cervids due to the presence of peptide markers at ~m/z 1196.6, m/z 1427.7, m/z 1550.8, m/z 2131.1, m/z 2883.4 and m/z 3033 (Fig. 2).

The one specimen found to derive from a non-cervid yielded markers not matching known collagen fingerprint for reference taxa.

The non-cervid sample is derived NE9F-3 and measured δ13C and δ15N values indicate isotope values consistent with marine organisms, in this case a marine mammal (see below).

ZooMS analysis confirmed that our fragmentary bone samples were terrestrial in origin, supporting the use of the IntCal curve, with one exception.

Chronology building first iteration: calibration

SECTION

NE16F

PARAGRAPH

The materials from excavation unit NE16F include three samples from levels 8, 6, and 5 (Fig. 3).

The conventional age for the specimens range from 1735 ± 20 BP to 1535 ± 15 BP, with isotopic values typical of a terrestrial herbivore (Table 2).

The agreement indices for the model are Amodel = 73.3 and Aoverall = 73.7 within the tolerance suggested by Bronk Ramsey (1995).

No significant stratigraphic reversals are noted in the unit.

SECTION

NE9F

PARAGRAPH

Four samples from excavation unit NE9F were dated, from levels 8 (n = 1), 5 (n = 1), and 3 (n = 2) (Fig. 4).

For this unit, we exclude one date from level 3 that was derived from marine mammal bone due to issues with the marine reservoir effect and unknown taxonomic designation potentially biasing calibration.

PARAGRAPH

The conventional ages for the unit span from 1660 ± 15 BP to 330 ± 15 BP, with isotopic values typical of a terrestrial herbivore (Table 3).

The excluded marine mammal sample conventional age is NE9F-3 2015 ± 25 BP (PSUAMS-1345: δ13C: −12.3 VPDB; δ15N: 14.7‰ Atm N2).

The agreement indices for the model are Amodel = 97.9 with an Aoverall = 97.9 well within the tolerance suggested by Bronk Ramsey (1995).

SECTION

SE8G

PARAGRAPH

The materials from excavation unit SE8G include three samples from excavation levels 7, 5, and 3 (Fig. 5).

The conventional ages for the samples range from 1770 ± 15 BP to 1440 ± 15 BP, with isotopic values typical of a terrestrial herbivore (Table 4).

The agreement indices for the model are A = 0 outside the tolerance suggested by Bronk Ramsey (1995) due to the stratigraphic reversal present in level 5.

SECTION

SW19D

PARAGRAPH

The materials from excavation unit SW19D include five samples from levels 7, 6, 5, 4 and 2 (Fig. 6).

The conventional ages for the samples range from 1640 ± 15 BP to 1300 ± 15 BP, with all isotopic values typical of a terrestrial herbivore (Table 5).

The agreement indices for the model are Amodel = 43.8 with an Aoverall = 48.4 outside the tolerance suggested by Bronk Ramsey (1995) due to the stratigraphic reversal present in level 6.

SECTION

Second iteration: models, phases and duration of occupation

PARAGRAPH

As the calibrations of dates from the four units demonstrate, stratigraphic reversals are found in the southern portions of the site in units SW19D and SE8G while the northern portion of the site seems to be stratigraphically intact.

These findings may be supported by site observations recorded by Phebus and Drucker in 1970.

On July 9th, field notes indicate that the:

PARAGRAPH

“Upper strata of the SE quadrant of this site feature appreciable quantities of fire-cracked stone amidst the usual shell deposit.

This [southern] area also features numerous indications of habitation such as hearths, lens[es], and structures.

The absence of such traits in the midden of the NW quadrant seems to imply that that area was more properly site dump debris.

This observation is consistent since the south side of the site would be the lee side and considerably more protected from the wind and weather.

This condition may also exist on the Palmrose [35CLT47] site where dominant features occur primarily on the south side.”

If the primary site habitation zone was in the southern portion of the site with refuse being discarded to the north, this may explain why deposits to the north appear more homogenous than sediments to the south.

Otherwise, the 14C reversals could be explained as a result of deposit mixing during site occupation, bioturbation, cross-cutting of discrete stratigraphic components—due to the excavation method of one foot arbitrary levels—or other natural or cultural factors (Ames, 1996; Erlandson and Rockwell, 1987; Jew et al., 2015; Losey, 2005).

PARAGRAPH

Following the first iteration of the Par-Tee calibration, we constructed a model of the site chronology based on evidence of site occupation from the 14C dates without emphasizing site stratigraphy, a result of the stratigraphic reversals (Table 6 and Fig. 7).

Given the coarse excavation methods at the site, the presence of stratigraphic reversals, and the limited excavation notes, we determined that defining the duration of occupation and identifying discrete phases of site occupation was best explored through an analysis and calibration of AMS 14C dates without reference to site stratigraphy.

PARAGRAPH

We began by compiling all dates derived from the current analysis, the cervid remains, and a previously reported elk bone harpoon date (UCIAMS-137938) in chronological order in OxCal 4.3.

The results appear to demonstrate a consistent occupation and cervid exploitation from cal AD 225 to cal AD 770.

However, seven of the fourteen dates cluster around cal AD 415 to cal AD 605, suggesting the possibility for intensive site use around this time with more discrete and intermittent periods of occupation.

Model 1: phases

PARAGRAPH

Based on the data from the heuristic model we explored the possibility that there were discrete phases of cultural activity at the Par-Tee site, related to cervid exploitation and site use (Fig. 7).

The model estimates the depositional start and end dates for each phase.

For the sequence we included start and end boundaries for the radiocarbon dates.

Additionally, we included boundaries and phases around clusters of dates defined in the heuristic calibration, assuming these clusters of dates were a result of discrete or episodic site habitation or cervid exploitation (Table 7 and Fig. 8).

PARAGRAPH

The agreement indices for Model 1 are Amodel = 112.5 and Aoverall = 109.6.

SECTION

Model 2: phases

PARAGRAPH

Following the calculation of Model 1, we further explored the potential for episodic deposition of cervid remains at Par-Tee.

Model 2 includes the previous assumptions that date clusters result from cultural exploitation of cervids and site use.

However, we include an additional boundary seperating each individual phase with discrete start and ends (Table 8 and Fig. 9).

The boundaries would suggest more episodic site use with periods of no habitation.

PARAGRAPH

The agreement indices for Model 2 are Amodel = 117.3 and Aoverall = 110.5.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The Bayesian analysis and calibration of the latest AMS 14C dates of the Par-Tee site suggest the site was occupied between cal AD ~200 and cal AD 800 based on the unmodeled radiocarbon calibrations.

The Bayesian models that explored the potential for discrete or episodic use of the site, suggest that although the Par-Tee site likely witnessed an intense occupation period at cal AD ~400–650, the site was occupied at a maximum from cal ~AD 100–900, as evidenced in models 1 and 2.

These new data constrain the overall occupation of the Par-Tee site, which was previously believed to have dated from 350 cal BC to cal AD 1150 a span of 1500 years (Arbolino et al., 2005; Colten, 2002; Losey and Yang, 2007; Sanchez et al., 2016).

The new high-precision AMS 14C dates restrict the occupation of the site by more than half, from a period of ~1500 years to ~700 years.

This more restricted date range is consistent with two AMS 14C dates obtained by Sanchez et al. (2016), one for a whale phalanx and a second for a cervid bone harpoon tip embedded in it.

AMS dates on marine shells may expand the age range by a century or two closer to ~100 BC (Losey and Yang, 2007), but uncertainties about spatial and temporal fluctuations in the regional marine reservoir effect make us less confident in those calibrated ages.

PARAGRAPH

Our reanalysis of the Par-Tee chronology supports previous interpretations of a later site use, which we date to cal AD ~1490–1635, potentially contemporaneous with the use of the shell midden as a cemetery site (Arbolino et al., 2005).

Further research of the Par-Tee assemblage is required to understand this later occupation.

If ethnographic and ethnohistoric patterns of burying the dead in locations away from primary residences are consistent with the burial practices at Par-Tee, people may have used the site to bury their dead away from residential areas (Arbolino et al., 2005).

PARAGRAPH

The revised chronology of the Par-Tee site suggests that our general understanding of the habitation of the broader Seaside region remains constant.

At this time, Palmrose appears to be the most ancient of the three sites, followed by Avenue Q, and lastly Par-Tee.

However, as the radiocarbon dates for Palmrose and Avenue Q are derived from unidentified charcoal samples with a high range of uncertainty (≥ ± 60), refined dating efforts may change the chronology of human occupation at these sites, as well.

PARAGRAPH

Our study minimizes one barrier to conducting research with the Par-Tee assemblage through the establishment of a more reliable chronology.

The new 14C dates for the Par-Tee site provide a well-defined and more constrained chronology for the analysis of the large artifact and faunal assemblage.

The revised chronology enhances forthcoming and future research of the Par-Tee collection by allowing the cultural practices, material culture, and environmental data in the collection to be placed on a reliable chronological foundation.

Conclusion

PARAGRAPH

Our 14C dating of the Par-Tee museum specimens suggests that archaeologists should interpret historically reported 14C dates with caution, especially those derived from composite samples of charcoal, bone, and shell and unidentified charcoal samples.

In addition, our findings highlight the value of reanalyzing legacy collections with improved dating techniques.

Although there appears to be more intensive use of the Par-Tee site between cal AD ~400–650, the majority of the Par-Tee site collection is best viewed as the result of a single long-term ~700–800 year occupation.

PARAGRAPH

We recommend that researchers working with legacy collections assess previously reported 14C dates for an assemblage for chronometric hygiene.

In those instances where previous 14C dates are lacking, fieldnotes and maps are incomplete, or available resources limit the number of 14C samples obtainable, researchers can use Bayesian chronological modeling software to estimate the quantity of dates needed and to produce precise and accurate models where stratigraphic information is missing or coarse-grained excavation methods prevent the use of essential stratigraphic information (Hamilton and Krus, 2018).

As AMS dates continue to become less costly, the type of chronological work we conducted at Par-Tee is becoming increasingly accessible to researchers at other museums and repositories around the world.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, the revised chronology of the Par-Tee site and the recent collections improvement work of the archaeological assemblage at the Smithsonian Institution will lead to further research of the large and diverse Par-Tee assemblage.

Ultimately, our work reinforces studies that demonstrate the value of revisiting and building new chronologies in a Bayesian framework for important legacy collections housed in museums around the world (Jew et al., 2015; Kennett et al., 2011; Kennett et al., 2014; Thulman, 2017).

In addition, the integration of collagen fingerprinting and high-resolution AMS dating allows for precision in dating and calibration that can enhance the value of museum collections for topics of broad interest to archaeologists and other researchers, while minimizing impacts of research on museum collections.
