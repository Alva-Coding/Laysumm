TITLE

Radiocarbon dating legacy collections: A Bayesian analysis of high-precision AMS 14C dates from the Par-Tee site, Oregon

PARAGRAPH

The Par-Tee site (35CLT20), located on the northern Oregon Coast, is a large archaeological collection excavated in the 1960s and 1970s.

Radiocarbon dates have been obtained on materials from the Par-Tee collection by researchers since the 1970s, but these data have not been assessed for chronometric hygiene.

To establish a reliable chronology for the Par-Tee site, we obtained new high-resolution accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates and collagen peptide mass fingerprinting of cervid bones.

We evaluate the new radiocarbon dates along with previous radiocarbon dates from the site, using chronometric hygiene assessments and Bayesian statistics to build a refined chronology.
