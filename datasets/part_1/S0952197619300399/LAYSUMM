TITLE

Sequential hypothesis tests for streaming data via symbolic time-series analysis

PARAGRAPH

This paper addresses sequential hypothesis testing for Markov models of time-series data by using the concepts of symbolic dynamics.

The study is motivated by time-critical detection problems in physical processes, where a temporal model is trained to make fast and reliable decisions with streaming data.

The technique guarantees that the test will terminate in finite time.

The underlying algorithms are first illustrated through an example by numerical simulation, and are subsequently validated on time-series data of pressure oscillations from a laboratory-scale swirl-stabilized combustor apparatus to detect the onset of thermo-acoustic instability with fewer observations in comparison to a fixed-sample-size test.
