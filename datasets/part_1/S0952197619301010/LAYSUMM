TITLE

New improved DEMATEL method based on both subjective experience and objective data

PARAGRAPH

The original DEMATEL method is a subjectively driven decision-making method.

It is certainly an efficient method for identifying key factors in complex systems, but the results based solely on subjective information will also include some accuracy problems.

Due to this limitation, a more precise method of combining subjective experience and objective data is crucial to replace the often-used ordinary approach.

This study presents a new improved DEMATEL method for the adapting to more complex realities in the detailed design by considering the expert information extraction and data analysis together.

In general, the combination of subjective and objective assessment results also enhances the application value of the final DEMATEL results.
