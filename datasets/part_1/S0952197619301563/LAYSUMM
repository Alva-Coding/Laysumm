TITLE

A hybrid optimization algorithm based on cuckoo search and differential evolution for solving constrained engineering problems

PARAGRAPH

This paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm to achieve less economic cost in dealing with real-world engineering problems.

The hybrid algorithm divides the whole population into two sub-populations with equal size, and simultaneously optimizes the sub-populations by different algorithms.

It not only can enhance the information exchange among individuals, but also can enrich the diversity of the whole population to avoid trapping into local optimum.

Finally, these experimental results receive satisfied performance in terms of unconstrained/constrained test functions and each constrained engineering problems.
