TITLE

XRF and LA-ICP-MS studies of gold and silver artefacts from a 12–13th century CE tumulus in Senegal: Implications for the medieval African gold trade

PARAGRAPH

Gold is one of the most renowned commodities in Africa’s economic history.

In spite of that importance, archaeology has so far contributed relatively little to the theme.

Through elemental analysis of 12th-13th century gold and silver artefacts from a Senegalese archaeological site, the paper presents evidence of a little known facet of the ancient linkages between West and North Africa.

It convincingly shows that, in addition to the documented mass export of West African raw gold to North Africa in medieval times, there was also a today largely neglected traffic of alloyed gold (and silver) into West Africa.
