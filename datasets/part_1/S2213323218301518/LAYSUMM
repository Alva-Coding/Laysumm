TITLE

Hemi-ESES associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum and normal cognition

PARAGRAPH

Continuous spike wave during sleep is an (EEG phenomenon typically seen in children with an) epileptic encephalopathy defined by (neuro)cognitive decline (and) various seizure types.

(Electrical status epilepticus of Slow Sleep is) a specific electroencephalographic pattern, (referred to as) ESES.

ESES is often a generalized pattern, but some studies have reported cases with hemi-ESES in (patients) with polymicrogyria, porencephalic cysts, hydrocephalus, and thalamic lesions.

(The) corpus callosum is one of the most important commissural structures (in the brain) integrating the activities of both cerebral hemispheres.

Moreover, the disruption of it (reduces) seizure propagation and generalized (seizures).

We describe a child with normal cognition, (epilepsy manifest as) nocturnal seizures (and) hemi-ESES (who was born with) absolutely no corpus callosum.
