TITLE

Integrating SEM-EDS in a sequential residue analysis protocol: Benefits and challenges

PARAGRAPH

The scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) has shown great potential for documenting and characterising archaeological residues.

This instrument provides high resolution images of tool residues in situ on the stone surface at very high magnifications, as well as an elemental fingerprint of adhering material.

When used together with traditional optical microscopes, it provides a powerful means for identifying tool residues.

Here, we propose a sequential protocol for residue analysis that includes an in situ residue screening of the tool with stereomicroscopes and SEM-EDS; followed by analysis of extracted residues under the transmitted light microscope and SEM-EDS.
