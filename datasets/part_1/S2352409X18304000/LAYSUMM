TITLE

New insights on the chronology of medieval mining activity in the small polymetallic district of Faravel (Massif des Ã‰crins, Southern French Alps) derived from dendrochronological and archaeological approaches

PARAGRAPH

This paper presents timbers study in the Faravel polymetallic district (Upper Durance valley, Southern French Alps).

The dendrochronological study of well-preserved timbers from small-size opencast mines gave up accurate tree felling dates with seasonal resolution.

The chronological distribution of these felling dates highlights nine distinct mining phases that occurred between 1059 and 1243 AD.

Associated with archaeological observations and radiocarbon analyses, this chronology evidenced short, seasonal and low-intensity mining campaigns, mainly carried out after the bulk of agropastoral activities.

Miners used rudimentary techniques based on the systematic reused of wood materials, which had limited impact on forest cover.
