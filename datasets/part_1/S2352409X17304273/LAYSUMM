TITLE

Scaling up: Stable isotope evidence for the intensification of animal husbandry in Bronze-Iron Age Lika, Croatia

PARAGRAPH

The Bronze-Iron Age transition in Lika, Croatia is characterized by a rapid and significant transformation in sociopolitical and economic organization, but the areaâ€™s challenging environment and topography likely made large-scale agriculture and livestock keeping difficult.

New stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values of domesticated animals show that communities adapted by practicing animal husbandry at different spatial and organizational scales.

Such strategies included the centralized movement of cattle and ovicaprid herds across large parts of the landscape and individual household management of pigs.
