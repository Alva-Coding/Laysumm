TITLE

Cereal processing technique inferred from use-wear analysis at the Neolithic site of Jiahu, Central China

PARAGRAPH

Grinding cereals into flour has taken place since the Palaeolithic period, yet the grinding method employed has often not been investigated.

Our study discovered the different features of use-wear traces associated with dry- and wet-grinding of cereals, which can be used to infer the ancient grinding techniques.

Applying this reference baseline to Jiahu, an early Neolithic site known for the early rice cultivation in Central China, reveals that dry-grinding was employed for cereal processing 9000 years ago.

This grinding method could have been inherited from the earlier hunter-gatherers, but could also result from a broad-spectrum subsistence strategy adopted at Jiahu.
