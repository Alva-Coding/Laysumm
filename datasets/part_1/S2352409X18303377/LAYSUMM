TITLE

Expanding the strontium isoscape for the American midcontinent: Identifying potential places of origin for Cahokian and Pre-Columbian migrants

PARAGRAPH

This study investigates the use of strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) to identify the movement of people and role of population diversity in 10th-13th century culture change in the North American midcontinent.

Tooth enamel from small animals from across the midcontinent provide baseline regional 87Sr/86Sr information.

Results show significant isotopic differences between some locations that enable identification of non-local individuals; however, considerable isotopic similarity within the midcontinent highlights the limitations of 87Sr/86Sr in determining place of origin.

Isotopic analysis, when combined with other geochemical, biological, and archaeological data, can contribute to our understanding of the movement of people in pre-Columbian America.
