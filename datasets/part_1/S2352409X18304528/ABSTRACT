ABSTRACT

TITLE

Micromorphology of the Early Iron Age semi-cemented floors: El Calvari del Molar (Tarragona, NE Spain) as case study

PARAGRAPH

This paper presents the microstratigraphic analysis of the protohistoric site El Calvari del Molar, dated to the 8th century and the first quarter of 6th century BCE.

It focuses specifically on Room 8, located in the northern part.

PARAGRAPH

The sedimentary record covers different stratigraphic units, including several floors with their layers of preparation and domestic structures.

The study of these floors, mainly through micromorphology, allows us to determine the composition, the processing and the technical treatment as well as the possible origin of the lithological materials used in their manufacture.

PARAGRAPH

We highlight that the floors are composed of earth construction, made of local carbonated materials, mainly clayey fine sands.

Mixing this material with water would cause a precipitation of CaCO3 favoured by the impermeability of their preparation layers, mostly silty clay aggregates, leading to the semi-cementation of the floor, which appears to have been the aim of the builders of El Calvari.

This type of earth floor brings together a series of characteristics at the construction level such as cohesion among particles and tenacity, similar features to lime mortars.

PARAGRAPH

In short, we have the opinion that the micromorphological analysis is an essential tool for the study and interpretation of domestic architectural elements.

In this case, it has allowed us to identify and characterize the techniques and construction strategies of this type of floor by these first protohistoric builders of the NE Iberia.
