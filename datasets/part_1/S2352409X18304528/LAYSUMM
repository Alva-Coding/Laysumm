TITLE

Micromorphology of the Early Iron Age semi-cemented floors: El Calvari del Molar (Tarragona, NE Spain) as case study

PARAGRAPH

Microstratigraphic analysis of several floors of Room 8 to the protohistoric site El Calvari del Molar (NE Spain).

Micromorphology allowed us to determine the composition, the processing and the technical treatment as well as the possible origin of the lithological materials used in their manufacture.

The floors are composed of earth construction, made of local carbonated materials.

Mixing this material with water would cause a precipitation of CaCO3Â favoured by the impermeability of their preparation layers leading to the semi-cementation of the floor.

This type of earth floor brings together a series of characteristics at the construction level similar to lime mortars.
