TITLE

New data about exploitation of the Zayukovo (Baksan) obsidian source in Northern Caucasus during the Paleolithic

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Obsidian is one of the most widely exploited raw materials in the Paleolithic of Eurasia and the Stone Age of Africa (McBrearty and Brooks, 2000; Negash and Shackley, 2006; Negash et al., 2006; Piperno et al., 2009).

Long-term studies (e.g., Glascock et al., 1998; Shackley, 2005) indicate that the chemical composition of obsidians is unique for each eruptive event.

Obsidian then becomes an especially valuable raw material for understanding human mobility in the Paleolithic.

Obsidian was exploited by early hominids since the end of Oldowan as indicated by transportation long distances.

In the Middle Paleolithic (MP) obsidian was transported >100 km in Central Europe (Féblot-Augustins, 1997) and >200 km in the Caucasus (Doronicheva and Shackley, 2014).

In the Upper Paleolithic (UP), transport distances of obsidian increased (Féblot-Augustins, 1997; Ono, 2014; Kuzmin, 2017), sometimes >700 km (Frahm and Hauck, 2017).

PARAGRAPH

In the Caucasus, obsidian represented the most attractive stone raw material for both MP Neanderthals and UP modern humans in both the northern (Doronicheva and Shackley, 2014; Doronicheva et al., 2016) and southern (Badalyan et al., 2004; Le Bourdonnec et al., 2012; Chataigner and Gratuze, 2014; Frahm et al., 2016; Glauberman et al., 2016; Pleurdeau et al., 2016; Tornero et al., 2016; Kandel et al., 2017; Biagi et al., 2017; Biagi and Nisbet, 2018) slopes of the Caucasus.

PARAGRAPH

Here the authors discuss new and significant data concerning the exploitation of the Zayukovo (Baksan) source in the Northern Caucasus during the Paleolithic, including results of our analysis of 34 new samples from Saradj-Chuko grotto (MP), Mezmaiskaya cave (MP and UP), Sosruko rockshelter and Kasojskaya cave (Epipalaeolithic, EPP).

Paleolithic obsidian transport in the Caucasus

PARAGRAPH

Numerous sources of obsidian are known in the Caucasus (Fig. 1), which were exploited from the Lower Paleolithic to the end of Paleolithic, as well as in the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages (Badalyan et al., 2004; Biagi et al., 2017; Frahm et al., 2017; Biagi and Nisbet, 2018).

PARAGRAPH

The bulk of the obsidian sources are known from the Lesser Caucasus: in Armenia, western part of Azerbaijan, south of Georgia and in eastern Turkey (Liubin and Belyaeva, 2009; Chataigner and Gratuze, 2014).

In the Northern Caucasus, only one obsidian source is known near the village of Zayukovo in Kabardino-Balkaria (Figs. 1 and 2).

The chemical composition of obsidian deposits is studied in both the southern and northern slopes of the Caucasus (Doronicheva and Shackley, 2014; Chataigner and Gratuze, 2014; Frahm et al., 2017).

PARAGRAPH

The published data of the technological strategies of the Mousterian Neanderthal population of the Lesser Caucasus indicate that obsidian accounts for 90–100% of the stone raw materials used in caves Lusakert, Yerevan, Gazma and Zar.

Research in Lusakert-1 cave in Armenia (Frahm et al., 2016) show that Neanderthals actively exploited local obsidian sources.

The researchers suggest that obsidian was collected by the hominids at various points near the site during daily activity in the river valley, which agrees well, in their opinion, with data on the Neanderthal dependence of local sources of raw materials.

PARAGRAPH

In territories located farther from obsidian outcrops (e.g., in Aveidag mountain ridge in Karabakh region), obsidian artifacts are rare.

Here local rocks were used: jasper, hornfels, diabase, and limestone.

Research in the Taglar cave reveals some regularity in the use of raw materials during the MP.

In the earlier levels, obsidian, including sources that are unknown near the site, was more actively used than in the later levels, when local raw materials were mainly exploited (Djafarov, 1999).

Researchers note the similarity between Mousterian industries in the eastern part of the Lesser Caucasus that of the Zagros Mountains (Golovanova and Doronichev, 2003).

PARAGRAPH

The first data on obsidian use in the Baroj-12 open-type site in Armenia (Glauberman et al., 2016) show that obsidians from sources located >100 km from the site were used irregularly, and mainly local sources of obsidians located at a distance of 1–2 km from the site were used.

PARAGRAPH

In most of the Upper Paleolithic sites only preliminary data on exploitation of obsidian is published.

Obsidian is represented in the Upper Paleolithic sites of Georgia and Abkhazia, together with argillite, basalt, and siliceous tuff (Liubin, 1989).

However, in most of the Upper Paleolithic sites in this region (Chakhati, Sakajia, Apiancha, and Samertskhle-klde) local flint, the sources of which are not specified and studied using petroarchaeological methods, is mainly reported.

More detailed data are available only for Ortvala Klde.

In the site, local high-quality flint prevails - 95.1%.

There is a small amount of non-local obsidian - up to 5–7% in different levels.

The nearest outcrops of obsidian are in the Javakheti region in southern Georgia, about 100 km from the site.

PARAGRAPH

In the multilayered Upper Paleolithic cave site of Aghitu-3 (39–24 ka) in Armenia (Kandel et al., 2017), obsidian is common in all strata.

Seven major sources of obsidian are identified.

In addition to local sources, sources located >100 km (150–180 km) and even >200 km (220–270 km) from the site were used.

Kandel et al. (2017) suggest that the predominance of local raw materials, primarily flint, in the Georgian sites indicates an absence of close contacts between the Upper Paleolithic populations of Georgia and the more southern region of Lesser Caucasus, which may be due to natural barriers.

Results

PARAGRAPH

The Zayukovo source located about 70–80 km to the north-east from the Elbrus volcano (5642 m asl) (Terek river basin, north-central Caucasus) is the only obsidian source known in the Northern Caucasus.

Obsidian is found here as boulders (“volcanic bombs”) in pyroclastic and secondary contexts near the village of Zayukovo in the Baksan river valley (Fig. 2; Nasedkin and Formozov, 1965; Le Bourdonnec et al., 2012; Doronicheva and Shackley, 2014).

PARAGRAPH

Our previously published results (Doronicheva and Shackley, 2014) of the EDXRF analysis of two obsidian flakes from MP layers 3 and 2B-2, dated ~73–60 kya in Mezmaiskaya cave indicates that both artifacts are derived from the Zayukovo source (approximately 200–250 km distant).

The lithic assemblages from these layers are attributed to the Eastern Micoquian industry (Golovanova, 2015; Golovanova et al., 2016).

Only 8 obsidian artifacts (<0.2% of the total MP lithics) are recovered in the layers and include 6 fragments and flakes, and 2 chips, and no tools.

Although no Eastern Micoquian site is known in the north-central Caucasus, the transport of obsidian suggests contacts between the Eastern Micoquian Neanderthals from Mezmaiskaya and this region during the Middle Paleolithic.

PARAGRAPH

In the north-central Caucasus, only the recently (2016) discovered Saradj-Chuko grotto (Doronicheva et al., 2017) produced evidence of active exploitation of the Zayukovo source, located 6–7 km west of the site, by local MP hominids.

Excavations in 2017 of 8 m2 revealed 11 levels in the site.

PARAGRAPH

In Layer 6A, a small (72 artifacts in total) assemblage from the 2017 excavation contains no tools and cores, and comprises only flakes (8), shatters (46), and chips (18).

Most of the artifacts are made from obsidian; two pieces are made from flint and one from silicified limestone.

This assemblage can be preliminarily dated to the Middle Paleolithic, but unfortunately is too small to draw substantive conclusions.

Two artifacts (a flake and a chip) were subjected to EDXRF analysis from layer 6A.

The analysis indicates that they originate from the Zayukovo obsidian source.

PARAGRAPH

The richest occupational level (about 200 lithic artifacts per square meter) is Layer 6B, only 20 cm thick.

Besides numerous stone artifacts, abundant charcoal and broken animal bones are found in this layer.

PARAGRAPH

The assemblage from Layer 6B (2017 excavation) includes 1591 lithic artifacts, 98% of which is made from obsidian, including all cores, technical and primary flakes (Fig. 3).

The chemical composition (Table 1) of 9 obsidian artifacts from Layer 6B analyzed using the EDXRF method indicates that they originate exclusively from the Zayukovo (Baksan) source (Fig. 4).

PARAGRAPH

The abundance of waste products from obsidian indicates that the knapping of this raw material was carried out directly at the site.

Artefact refitting results confirm on-site knapping of obsidian and also show that obsidian knapping is related to the main concentration of artifacts.

In general, the analysis of the assemblage from Layer 6B suggests that this occupational level shows evidence of active habitation in the cave of the hominids engaged in intensive knapping and production of tools from local obsidian.

On the contrary, the composition of flint artifacts indicates that flint was brought to the cave as ready to use flakes and retouched tools that were only rejuvenated in the site.

PARAGRAPH

The retouched tools in layer 6B are not numerous yet, but include the tool types, such as prevailing simple scrapers, rare diagonal and angled scrapers, convergent tools, and Mousterian points that are typical for Levallois-laminar Mousterian industries in the Southern Caucasus.

Several tools have thinning retouch from the ventral surface, which is also a characteristic feature of the Levallois-laminar Mousterian industries in the Southern Caucasus (Golovanova and Doronichev, 2003; Golovanova, 2015).

PARAGRAPH

The lithic assemblage from Layer 6B represents a Levallois-laminar Mousterian industry.

The laminar character differs of the Mousterian industry of north-central and north-eastern Caucasus from the Eastern Micoquian industry widespread in the north-western Caucasus, and is similar to Mousterian industries known in the Southern Caucasus (Golovanova, 2015).

While results of radiometric dating are pending, the results of pollen analysis suggest an early MP (probably MIS 5) age of the lithic industry from Layer 6B in Saradj-Chuko.

Future research in Saradj-Chuko grotto will allow us to better determine chronology and cultural peculiarities of the local hominid population in this region during the Middle Paleolithic, and its relations with other Neanderthal groups in the Caucasus.

PARAGRAPH

The time period between 40 and 30 ka cal BP was significant for the dispersal of essentially new EUP industries distinguished by developed blade and bladelet technologies, and numerous and variable tools made on blades and bladelets across the entire Eurasia.

In the Caucasus, the archaeological record indicates the initial arrival of UP modern humans between 40 and 38 ka cal BP.

Modern data indicate that the Caucasian early UP industry is more similar to the Early Ahmarian industry in the Levant than to any variant of the Aurignacian (Bar-Yosef et al., 2011; Golovanova and Doronichev, 2012).

PARAGRAPH

To date, the most representative series of obsidian artifacts (22 pieces) is analyzed from the UP layers in Mezmaiskaya cave dated between 40 and 21 kya (Doronicheva and Shackley, 2014).

The chemical composition of the obsidian artifacts indicates that most of them are derived from the Zayukovo source, while a few pieces originate from the Chikiani-Paravani (or Kojun Dag) source in southern Georgia, in the Lesser Caucasus (approximately 450 km southwest from Mezmaiskaya Cave).

In Mezmaiskaya, the most numerous collection of obsidian artifacts is found in the uppermost UP Layer 1A.

It contains technical flakes, flakes with cortex, and chips, the artefact groups suggesting that limited knapping of obsidian would have taken place directly on the site (Fig. 5).

The 2018 study (Table 1) further confirms previous findings.

Transport of obsidian from the south of Georgia to the North-western Caucasus, and to the Southern Caucasus from Anatolia (Le Bourdonnec et al., 2012) confirms well the northward direction of migration of UP humans.

PARAGRAPH

After a chronological gap between ca. 26–25–20–19 ka cal BP corresponding to the LGM—a cold event, which interrupted the Upper Paleolithic development in the Caucasus—a new Epipalaeolithic (EPP) industry appears in the Southern and Northern Caucasus, and exists from ca. 19–18 ka cal BP to the end of the Pleistocene at ca. 12–11.5 ka cal BP (Golovanova et al., 2014).

During the EPP, archaeological record document increase of the number of sites, growth of mobility of EPP human groups, and more intense human occupation of the Caucasus compared to the UP occupation of the region before the LGM.

In the Northern Caucasus, a major concentration of about 20 stratified EPP sites postdating the LGM is known in the Kuban River basin, in the north-western Caucasus (Golovanova et al., 2014).

PARAGRAPH

Recently Doronicheva and Shackley (2014) published results of the analysis of obsidian artifacts from the EPP layers 1–3 and 1–4 in Mezmaiskaya cave.

The obsidian artifacts originate from the Chikiani-Paravani source and from the Zayukovo (Baksan) source.

Also, for this study we analyzed 2 obsidian artifacts from the EPP Layer 4, horizons 2 and 5 at Kasojskaya Cave located about 50–60 km from Mezmaiskaya.

The XRF analyses determined that they were produced from the same Zayukovo (Baksan) source (Table 1).

The EPP assemblages from Mezmaiskaya and Kasojskaya are attributed to the same industry (Golovanova et al., 2014) and dated from 20 to 21 to 10 kya.

PARAGRAPH

In the north-central Caucasus, only three EPP sites are known.

They all are located in the Baksan River.

Two of them, Sosruko and Alebastroviy Zavod rockshelters were excavated in the 1950s (Zamiatnin and Akritas, 1957), but have had no numerical dates until now.

The recently discovered Badynoko rockshelter was excavated in 2004, and produced lithic assemblages dated to the EPP and early Holocene (Zenin and Orlova, 2006; Seletsky et al., 2017).

Among these localities, Sosruko and Badynoko rockshelters now represent the basic sites that produce knowledge about chronology and cultural development during the final of Pleistocene — early Holocene in the region.

PARAGRAPH

In 2017, research in Sosruko rockshelter was resumed by L. Golovanova (Fig. 6).

The 15 obsidian artifacts analyzed from this site come from the new excavation (Table 1).

The composition of the obsidian samples is identical and indicates their local origin from the Zayukovo source (Fig. 7).

PARAGRAPH

The collection of layer 7 contains 896 artifacts excavated from an area of 3 m2 with the layer of about 20 cm thick.

The majority of them are made from obsidian - 81.9%, and a fewer number from flint - 18.1%.

9 cores and 13 technical flakes (CTE) indicate that obsidian knapping was produced on-site.

Most cores are heavily reduced.

Most flakes have cortex (48.6%).

The layer 7 assemblage composition has complete analogies among EPP industries of the North-Western Caucasus, such as Mezmaiskaya Cave, layer 1–3; Kasozhskaya cave, Gubs 7 rockshelter (Satanay); Baranaha-4, and others (Golovanova and Doronichev, 2012).

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

This study of raw material strategies, based on identification of stone raw material sources exploited by various hominid groups, provides significant information about the mobility of Paleolithic hominids.

Obsidian represents the raw material that was highly valued in the Paleolithic.

This is evidenced by transport of obsidian over long distances.

PARAGRAPH

Until recently, it was believed that mobility of Neanderthals was very low (Geneste, 1988, 1990; Turq, 1992), compared to early modern humans.

In the Middle Paleolithic, the predominance of local (0–5 km) raw materials was used as evidence of limited mobility of Neanderthals and, consequently, their archaic behavior.

In the Upper Paleolithic, on the contrary, transportation of stone raw materials to 600 km and more is common (Sulgostowska, 2006; Féblot-Augustins, 1997).

In addition, in the Upper Paleolithic some non-utilitarian objects, such as shells and patches, were transported over long distances (400–500 km and more) (Roebroeks et al., 1988; Borić and Cristiani, 2016).

PARAGRAPH

However, some researchers surmise that not only the UP modern humans, but also the MP Neanderthals engaged in developed social networks (Kaufman, 2002).

In some regions, for example in Central Europe, evidence of movement of raw materials over distances of >300 km is found at the end of the Middle Paleolithic (Féblot-Augustins, 1993; Rensink et al., 1991).

In the Sham Gran site in central France, a petroarchaeological analysis shows (Slimak and Giraud, 2007) that a small number of artifacts (<1%) was produced from raw materials located >250 km north and south of the site.

In some MP sites in the Central Europe (Kulna, Erd, etc.) researchers (Kozlowski and Sachse-Kozlowska, 1981; Svoboda, 1983) note transport of flint at distances over 200 km.

Transportation of raw materials to 100–150 km is reported in some MP sites in Greece (Spinapolice, 2012).

Also, in Italy (Vicino and d’Errico, 1985; Porraz and Negrino, 2008) there are data about MP transportation of jasper and flint to distances of 100 and >200 km.

In the Middle Paleolithic of Central Europe, obsidian was also transported to distances >100 km (Sobalyuk, Budöspest, Sajóbábony, Ballavolgyi, Farkaskö, Kecskésgalya; Féblot-Augustins, 1997).

PARAGRAPH

In the early Upper Paleolithic (~41–32 ka) there is evidence of transport of obsidian from sources located in Turkey to a site in southern Syria (Frahm and Hauck, 2017).

In the Upper Paleolithic of north-eastern Asia (ca. 30–10,000 BP) obsidian was transported to 200–300 km, and in rare cases - up to 800 km (Kuzmin, 2012).

In general, the Upper Paleolithic provides much more data about transportation of raw materials, primarily flint and obsidian to long distances reaching hundreds of kilometers (Delvigne et al., 2016).

This may reflect both more active movements and social interactions of modern human groups including establishment of expansive exchange and trade networks, and formation of large tribal associations (Borić and Cristiani, 2016).

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

The obsidian source provenance research adds important data to current debates about cultural similarity, contacts, and mobility of MP Neanderthals and UP modern humans in the Northern and Southern Caucasus.

PARAGRAPH

The study of obsidian artifacts from MP sites in the Northern Caucasus indicates distant contacts between the Eastern Micoquian Neanderthals in the north-western Caucasus and the Zayukovo (Baksan) obsidian source area in the north-central Caucasus.

Our research in Saradj-Chuko grotto suggests that a different Neanderthal population bearing a Levallois-laminar Mousterian industry occupied the north-central Caucasus and intensively exploited the same obsidian source Fig. 8.

PARAGRAPH

In the Middle Paleolithic, evidence of obsidian transportation of distances >200 km is reported for the first time.

Some researchers (Golovanova and Doronichev, 2005) associate such long-distance raw material transport with inter-regional movements of mobile Neanderthal groups.

The study of the Middle Paleolithic sites of the Caucasus shows that obsidian from remote sources was brought to the sites as ready-made tools and chips.

It is important to note that transport of obsidian from the southern Caucasus to sites in the north-western Caucasus is not present, probably indicating that contacts between Eastern Micoquian Neanderthals of North-Western Caucasus and their contemporaries in the South-Western Caucasus, who produced lithic industries similar to MP in Anatolia, Levant and Zagros, were either absent or restricted.

In the Eastern Caucasus, cultural similarity between Neanderthal populations of the northern and southern slopes of the Caucasus can be traced quite distinctly (Golovanova, 2015), but no transport of raw materials is identified so far between the regions.

PARAGRAPH

In the Upper Paleolithic, the obsidian research suggests existence of extensive social networks that provided obsidian transport from sources in southern Georgia to the UP and EPP sites in western Georgia and then to the UP and EPP sites in the north-western Caucasus, as well as from the Zayukovo (Baksan) source in the north-central Caucasus to the UP and EPP sites in the north-western Caucasus.

Apparently, obsidian transport facilitated cultural contacts and experienced interchange among modern human groups that occupied different regions of the Caucasus throughout the entire Upper Paleolithic.

PARAGRAPH

In the Upper Paleolithic, obsidian transport becomes even more active.

The transportation of obsidian from the Elbrus region (200–250 km) and the South Caucasus (about 450 km) to Mezmaiskaya cave in the North-Western Caucasus confirms the techno-typological similarity between the Upper Paleolithic industries of Mezmaiskaya cave and the Upper Paleolithic sites of Georgia.

Moreover, the transport of obsidian allows us to suggest direct contacts between modern human groups that inhabited these regions, and confirms northward migration of modern human groups that firstly entered to the Caucasus from more southern regions at the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic.
