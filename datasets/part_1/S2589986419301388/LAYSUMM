TITLE

Successful management of postictal violence with pindolol in temporal lobe epilepsy

PARAGRAPH

Violence following seizures is uncommon, however, can be extremely distressing to affected patients and their families.

While medications are available to treat aggressive behavior, the most commonly used drugs are often associated with considerable side effects.

Pindolol is a high blood pressure medication that can be beneficial in treating aggressive behavior in head injury patients.

We report a patient with a history of violence following seizures which was completely controlled with pindolol.

This finding is important as it provides a novel approach to the treatment of post seizure violence in patients with epilepsy that is better tolerated than typical treatments.
