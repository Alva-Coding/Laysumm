TITLE

Astragalar morphology: Approaching the cultural trajectories of wild and domestic sheep applying Geometric Morphometrics

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

In terms of heads, sheep is the second most important mammal livestock species in the world today after cattle (FAO Statistical Pocketbook, 2015: Table 5).

Sheep is probably also the livestock species with the most diverse breeds selected for particular traits including wool, milk, meat and fat.

Regardless whether securing food supply was the primary reason for raising sheep in an anthropogenic environment, osseous remains from domestic sheep in early Neolithic contexts clearly illustrate that the animals' meat and fat were systematically exploited by these communities.

The breeding of sheep directed towards higher milk, fat and wool yields, however, required profound knowledge of their reproductive biology and behaviour as well as breeding skills, since wild sheep – like their early domesticated relatives – did not possess substantial fat depots or woolly coats.

In addition, improvement of handling techniques helped lowering stress levels in animals raised in captivity, which was essential to stimulate reproductive success and milk let-down in ewes.

Since economically valuable traits such as ample wool or fat cannot be inferred directly from archaeological bones, literature continues debating the spatio-temporal origins of sheep lineages possessing these qualities (Russell, 2012: 211–256).

SECTION

Methodological considerations

PARAGRAPH

To discern specific domestic traits in ancient livestock populations the archaeozoological toolbox offers several approaches.

Amongst these, demographic profiling, osteometric comparison and taxonomic change figure most prominently.

They have often been used in combination in order to identify for instance the early phases of caprine domestication (e.g., Peters et al., 1999, 2005; Zeder, 2005), to infer husbandry strategies and livestock economies (e.g., Payne, 1973) or to trace the initial exploitation of secondary products such as milk and wool (e.g., Vigne and Helmer, 2007; Arbuckle, 2014).

Until now, however, the appearance and exploitation of fat-tailed or fat-rumped sheep is rarely addressed in archaeozoological literature and if so, discussion centres on iconographic representations (e.g., Zeuner, 1963; Benecke, 1994; Gifford-Gonzalez and Hanotte, 2011).

PARAGRAPH

New biomolecular methods, such as residue analysis allowing for the detection of milk fat in ceramics (Evershed et al., 2008), stable isotope analysis (e.g., Lösch et al., 2006; Vigne and Helmer, 2007; Peters et al., 2014) or the analysis of ancient DNA (e.g., Chessa et al., 2009; Demirci et al., 2013; Lv et al., 2015; Schroeder et al., 2017) help to elucidate the ways humans exploited domestic ruminants, but have their own limitations.

For instance, milk fat has only been identified so far in form of food residues preserved in ceramic containers, but in Southwest Asia milk exploitation likely started a millennium or more before the emergence of pottery (Vigne and Helmer, 2007), complicating demonstration prior to this.

Ancient DNA analysis is probably the method of choice for detailing the history of sheep domestication and husbandry since exhibiting the highest resolution.

However, collagen usually is badly preserved in sheep bones recovered from archaeological sites located in arid and hot regions.

This also applies to most specimens from arid Southwest Asia (Bollongino and Vigne, 2008), one of the regions worldwide that witnessed early ungulate domestication and the initial stages of selective breeding for novel lineages.

PARAGRAPH

A comparably recent but meanwhile well-established and most useful addition to the archaeozoological toolbox is Geometric Morphometrics (GMM).

It proved a very sensitive method for separating morphologically closely related taxa as well as wild and domestic ungulate populations and even domestic breeds of the same species (e.g., Evin et al., 2013; Owen et al., 2014; Evin et al., 2015; Duval et al., 2015; Haruda, 2016; Cucchi et al., 2017).

In contrast to biomolecular methods, bone diagenesis does not affect its application nor is GMM an invasive approach, a major advantage when dealing with the finite “resource” of archaeological bone finds.

GMM can therefore be considered an ideal complement to the methods mentioned before.

PARAGRAPH

Until now, GMM has rarely been applied to postcranials of sheep.

In a study using a 3D approach, Haruda (2014) was able to distinguish between astragali from sheep populations adapted to different landscapes in Central Asia.

In a more recent pilot study we were able to demonstrate that 2D GMM of sheep astragali allows distinguishing archaeological wild and modern domestic sheep (Pöllath et al., 2018).

However, from this limited dataset it remained unclear whether this morphological separation related to the animals' domestication status or if other factors, like for instance sexual dimorphism, were involved.

We therefore decided to enlarge our dataset substantially by adding two modern (i.e. wool sheep and primitive feral sheep) and two prehistoric populations of domestic sheep as well as one modern population of wild sheep.

With this significantly larger dataset at hand, we are now able to investigate in much more detail astragalar size and shape in distinct types of sheep as well as some factors accounting for the differences observed.

The dataset also allows us to take a closer look at the morphological relationships between modern domestic sheep populations exhibiting specific traits, ancient and modern wild sheep, and prehistoric domestic sheep.

In sum, the study presented here aims at evaluating the potential of GMM to characterize archaeological and modern sheep populations in different parts of Eurasia.

It deliberately includes prehistoric sheep from regions facing arid and hot climatic conditions, where research has demonstrated that biomolecular techniques are likely to fail.

In doing so, our study aims at a better understanding of the complex cultural history of domestic sheep in SW Asia, assumedly representing a key region for Ovis domestication and the development of lineages characterized by woolly coats and fat tails.

SECTION

Biological framework

PARAGRAPH

Starting point for our study are the populations of wild sheep assumed to be ancestral to the domestic lineages.

While the urial (Ovis vignei) and the argali (Ovis ammon) can be excluded based on genetic studies (Hiendleder et al., 1998), the question unsolved concerns the sub-species of the SW Asian wild sheep ancestral to the domestic form and whether domestication efforts involved geographically distinct (sub-)populations, or not.

The first hypothesis seems likely given the diversity of mitochondrial haplogroups in present-day domestic sheep breeds and their phylogeography (Tapio et al., 2006; Meadows et al., 2011; Geörg, 2013).

Resolving this lingering issue, however, is complicated due to the fact that taxonomy and related nomenclature of SW Asian wild sheep are both controversial and inconsistent, or as Damm and Franco (2014: 193) put it: “In general, nomenclature and classification of these wild sheep is controversial, resulting in a confusing mess of published, unpublished and ‘almost published’ nomenclature” (for a more detailed discussion see Text SI 2).

Because firstly the taxonomy of extant wild sheep is currently unresolved and secondly it is unlikely that the actual distribution pattern of wild sheep populations corresponds to that of the distant past, we refrain from adopting one of the scientific names proposed in literature and will use the term ‘wild sheep’ in the following when referring to the ancestral form of the domestic populations investigated here.

PARAGRAPH

Finally, to prevent confusion two clarifying explanations are necessary: In ecology and genetics ‘population’ is defined as a group of conspecific organisms that interbreed and live in the same place at the same time (King et al., 2006).

However, since it is most improbable that individuals whose bones have been excavated in prehistoric sites inhabited for centuries or millennia lived and interacted with each other contemporaneously in the same place, we cannot but use the term ‘population’ here in a modified way, i.e. a phenotypically and/or geographically distinguished group of organisms (here sheep) that in the past occurred broadly contemporaneous in the same region.

In addition, for past livestock populations one should avoid using terms like “breed” and “race”, since these are modern definitions that cannot be applied to their pre-modern relatives.

SECTION

Material

PARAGRAPH

We examined a total of 271 astragali pertaining to eight populations of wild and domestic sheep (Table 1; Table SI 1 for a detailed list of modern reference material).

The modern comparatives are housed in the Museum of Livestock Sciences in Halle (Saale), the British Natural History Museum in London and the Field Museum in Chicago.

The archaeological samples were recorded in the Staatssammlung für Anthropologie und Paläoanatomie in München and in the depots of on-going archaeological excavation projects in Turkey.

Since the modern samples serve as baselines for answering methodological issues, such as the influence of sex and age on astragalar shape and size, we opted for populations yielding sufficient numbers of individuals of known origin, sex, age and, ideally, with documented living conditions (e.g., mobility, nutrition).

For sheep assemblages from archaeological sites, however, obtaining adequate samples was not always easy, since sample size depends not only on the quantity of animal remains excavated, but also on their state of preservation.

For GMM, complete, well preserved, unburned and undamaged specimens are prerequisite.

Most notably, even in cases where only single aspects of a specimen will be evaluated, in our case the dorsal view of the astragalus, it was noted that many archaeological specimens did not even meet this condition.

Relevant sample size being a second prerequisite, we originally aimed at a sample size of about 30 specimens per population.

This was not reached in all cases, though.

As a consequence, we needed to test the suitability of smaller samples and reduce dimensionality regarding certain sensitive analyses (see below).

The archaeological assemblages

PARAGRAPH

The archaeological specimens come from four sites in Turkey and Syria (Fig. 1).

As we are dealing with isolated astragali representing butchering and consumption refuse, species identification had to rely on morphological criteria to distinguish between Ovis and Capra, the two morphologically very similar caprine species native to this region.

We applied the criteria as published by Boessneck et al. (1964), taking into account the review on the reliability of these criteria by Zeder and Lapham (2010).

From this it can be seen that the risk of misidentification for astragali is small, more precisely 3% in sheep and 0% in goats (Zeder and Lapham, 2010: Table 5).

In other words, few sheep astragali were erroneously identified as goats, but not a single goat astragalus as pertaining to sheep.

We therefore consider it unlikely that our samples contained misidentified goat astragali.

PARAGRAPH

As baseline for an ancestral population presumably bearing a close relationship with early domestic sheep, we analysed sheep astragali from two sites in SE Anatolia, namely Göbekli Tepe and Gusir Höyük.

Located in the northern arch of the Fertile Crescent, this region is considered a possible core area of early sheep domestication (Peters et al., 1999, 2017).

Göbekli Tepe is situated on one of the southernmost brows of the Germuş mountain range, c. 18 km northeast of the modern town of Şanlıurfa (Fig. 1).

Excavations since 1995 unearthed a multiphase site with megalithic round to oval structures and at least two phases comprising larger roundish and smaller rectangular buildings respectively.

Although the relative chronology of these two major architectural phases and their associated material culture is still not understood in full detail, building activities likely started in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA; ~9600–8700 calBCE) and ceased in the Early Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (EPPNB; ~8700–8200 calBCE; Dietrich, 2011; Dietrich et al., 2013).

From Göbekli Tepe 36 astragali could be included in this study (Table 1).

PARAGRAPH

The site of Gusir Höyük is located about 40 km south of the provincial capital of Siirt at Lake Gusir close to the confluence of the Tigris and Botan Rivers (Fig. 1; Karul, 2011).

Compared to Göbekli Tepe radiocarbon dates suggest a slightly earlier onset but all in all shorter human occupation at Gusir Höyük lasting from ~ 9750–8800 calBCE (Karul, 2011).

The excavated structures represent mainly round to oval-shaped buildings, which were in their majority interpreted as remains of houses.

From Gusir Höyük, 17 specimens have been retained for GMM analyses (Table 1).

This sample is the smallest in our study and below our targeted sample size, but was nonetheless included since already included in our first study (Pöllath et al., 2018).

From this we know that the sheep astragali from Göbekli Tepe and Gusir Höyük were morphologically similar enough to be grouped together.

PARAGRAPH

The wild status of these animals is inferred from the fact that all archaeozoological parameters for sheep and other potential domesticates like pig and cattle point to game animals (Peters et al., 2013, 2014).

Stable isotope analyses contradict an anthropogenic influence on the life cycle of Ovis as well (Lösch et al., 2006; Peters et al., 2014).

The same conclusion can be drawn from the demographic profiles of both populations.

They lack the young male kill-off pattern considered a marker for initial domestication (Zeder, 2011; but see Arbuckle and Atici, 2013).

On the contrary, the osteometric analyses in combination with age-at-death profiles demonstrate that hunters primarily killed prime-age males.

This is either consistent with a hunting strategy seeking to maximise the return of the hunt (Stiner, 1990; Zeder, 2011) or reflects, in the case of opportunistic hunting, successful targeting of bachelor herds (e.g., Hesse, 1977: 338ff.).

In any case, the demographic profiles for sheep at Göbekli Tepe and Gusir Höyük are not in line with early Neolithic livestock management or herding strategies hitherto documented in literature.

PARAGRAPH

Complementary to these early Neolithic wild sheep astragali we added samples of prehistoric domestic sheep once populating the wider region of initial sheep domestication and husbandry, more precisely from the sites of Güvercinkayası in Central Turkey and Tall Munbāqa in northern Syria (Fig. 1).

Güvercinkayası is a Middle Chalcolithic site occupied during the 6th and 5th millennia BCE and situated on the Melendiz River c. 20 km east of modern-day Aksaray in Central Anatolia (Gülçur, 1999, 2012).

Tall Munbāqa was an important Bronze Age city-state on the Middle Euphrates, located c. 35 km west of Ar-Raqqa (Werner, 1998).

The sheep astragali investigated from Tall Munbāqa originate exclusively from Late Bronze Age contexts.

PARAGRAPH

The domestic status of sheep at Güvercinkayası can be deduced from the small size of the astragali, measurements showing almost no overlap with their homologues in wild sheep from Göbekli Tepe and Gusir Höyük (see Fig. 4).

Although disputed as a marker for the initial stages of the domestication process, we consider (small) bone size a good and valid indicator of a domestic status of individuals and of sheep population(s) in ceramic Neolithic and later contexts.

The domestic status of the Güvercinkayası sheep is supported by the animals' horn size and morphology.

This is illustrated by their smaller size, less robust appearance, a dominance of adult females and the fact that wild taxa are almost absent from the faunal record in general (Arbuckle et al., 2009; Arbuckle, 2012; Buitenhuis, 1999).

Compared to Güvercinkayası, Tall Munbāqa sheep show considerable overlap in size with wild sheep (Fig. 4).

This could raise suspicion that wild sheep astragali are occasionally present in this sample.

However, taxonomic analysis of the Munbāqa faunal assemblage revealed that medium and large game is extremely rare in the faunal inventory, with not a single record of wild sheep (Boessneck and von den Driesch, 1986; Boessneck and Peters, 1988).

The bigger size of the Munbāqa sheep compared to Güvercinkayası can be explained best by the presence of a larger, more robustly built type of domestic sheep, a point to which we will return later.

SECTION

Modern reference populations

PARAGRAPH

In our pilot study (Pöllath et al., 2018) we had to refrain from discussing several factors possibly influencing the shape of the astragali due to the lack of appropriate samples.

To close this gap, we analysed additional series of astragali from modern individuals of known breed, sex, age and, ideally, living conditions.

This information was extracted from the records kept in the respective collections.

In a number of cases we could not find age-at-death data in the archives.

If so, we assessed the individual age with the aid of epiphyseal fusion data and the status of tooth eruption and wear (based on Payne, 1973, 1987 and Zeder, 2006).

Unfortunately, information about sex, age etc. was not available in balanced numbers for all populations investigated, explaining why the analyses had to be performed in varying combinations.

SECTION

Wild sheep population

PARAGRAPH

In order to complement the ancient wild sheep data from Göbekli Tepe and Gusir Höyük we evaluated a series of extant wild sheep as their closest living relatives.

A representative collection of Asiatic mouflons is housed in the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, and consists of skeletons acquired in the 1960's in Iran by the Street and Lay Nadler expeditions, with the exception of a single individual from Iraq collected in 1955 by Ch.

Reed (Lay, 1967; Zeder, 2006; unpublished museum records; see also Table SI 1).

Geographically the specimens were collected from seven regions (Zeder, 2006: Fig. 1), namely (1) the region south of the Caspian Sea, which we excluded from the onset since exclusively Ovis vignei; (2) 24 specimens coming from two protected areas in the north-western Iranian provinces of West and East Azerbaijan; (3) six specimens from the Iranian province Kurdistan and the Iraqi Kurdistan region; (4) two specimens from the Kermanshah Province; (5) four specimens from the Isfahan Province; (6) one specimen from the Bushehr Province; (7) four specimens from the Sistan and Baluchistan Provinces.

PARAGRAPH

Based on the maps in Zeder (2006: Fig. 1) and in Damm and Franco (2014: 197) the wild sheep found in the Sistan and Baluchistan Provinces likely represent O. vignei blandfordi (see also SI 2).

Furthermore, already Valdez et al. (1978) assumed a possible hybridisation between urial and wild sheep in central and southern Iran based on molecular and morphological characteristics.

Apart from the uncertain taxonomic status for most of the specimens in regions (3) to (7), also the small sample size for most of the wild sheep populations takes effect.

As will be demonstrated below, sample sizes below 15 specimens are unreliable in our case, which is why we restricted analyses to individuals collected in NW Iran (n = 24).

The sex of these sheep was already recorded in the field but cross-checked by us with the aid of sex-specific morphological characteristics found in the pelvic bones and the horn cores.

The estimation of their age at death was based on the eruption and wear of mandibular teeth and epiphyseal fusion.

As already said, these individuals were taken from the wild, they ranged freely in the mountainous landscapes of the Zagros and Alborz mountain ranges respectively, indicating that their foraging behaviour and mobility likely resembled that in ancient wild sheep roaming the western part of the Zagros and the eastern part of the Taurus mountains.

SECTION

Domestic sheep populations

PARAGRAPH

The living conditions of the domestic sheep kept in the “Haustiergarten” (garden of livestock animals) of the Martin-Luther University at Halle-Wittenberg differed considerably.

Most of the time animals were kept in small compounds with not enough space to exercise.

However, feeding conditions were good, the animals receiving alfalfa, green fodder, crop straw etc. (Behr, 1928).

Curated in the Museum of Livestock Science in Halle (Schafberg and Wussow, 2010), we analysed 40 astragali of Karakul sheep and 23 astragali of Marsch sheep (Table 1; see also Table SI 1).

Karakul sheep was chosen firstly because it is the most numerous sheep breed in the Halle collection and secondly because it is a fat-tailed sheep with coarse wool and therefore a representative of a group of breeds widely distributed across Western and Central Asia and arid Africa (SI 3a).

As an example of a typical European breed we investigated astragali of the Marsch sheep, an adaptable, robust type of sheep once widespread in the coastal wetlands of northern Germany, the Netherlands and England (Utieschil, 1856) and in terms of numbers most common amongst this type of sheep in the Halle collection (SI 3b).

For this study we included only Marsch sheep from Germany.

Its name ‘Marsch sheep’ derives from the Low German word ‘Marsch’ for coastal wetlands, which is equivalent to the English ‘marsh’.

The majority of animals whose astragali were analysed by us was born and raised in the Haustiergarten, few of them were purchased from breeders to start the breeding programme in Halle or in order to restock population.

For all specimens investigated the sex is known and for most the age at death as well.

Only for those individuals purchased from breeders, age at death had to be estimated with the aid of dental and epiphyseal fusion data.

Feral sheep population

PARAGRAPH

Our study also includes a population of feral sheep, in this case a sample of Soays collected in the islands of the St. Kilda archipelago in the Outer Hebrides (Table 1; see also Table SI 1; SI 3c).

They descend from domestic stock likely introduced to the Hebrides early in prehistory (Clutton-Brock et al., 1990).

Soay sheep are traditionally classified as a “primitive breed” based on their dark and coarse hair, the moulting of their coat in spring and the presence of horns in females.

Based on ancient DNA analyses Soays are now considered representing relics of the first migration of domestic sheep to Europe (Chessa et al., 2009).

They therefore qualify as ideal candidates when studying morphological relationships between wild, early domestic and modern populations exhibiting special traits.

It should be noted, though, that in the course of the last 250 years, some introgression with wool sheep occurred (Feulner et al., 2013), but after the last inhabitants had left the St. Kilda archipelago some 80 years ago, contact to humans became rare, apart from occasional visits of scientists (Campbell, 1974; Clutton-Brock et al., 1990; Clutton-Brock and Pemberton, 2004).

The Soay skeletons housed in the Natural History Museum, London, were collected during several scientific expeditions to Hirta, the largest island of the archipelago.

Living without human interference Soay sheep were free to roam, reproduce and feed at will.

For animals tagged during expeditions, sex and approximate age-at-death records are available, which were checked and, if possible, narrowed down with the help of epiphyseal fusion and dental data.

For untagged animals sex identifications were established applying the same procedures.

Occasionally isolated bones of – according to the texture of the bone – adult animals collected on Hirta were also included, but in such cases age and sex could not be established anymore.

Geometric Morphometrics

PARAGRAPH

In contrast to our pilot study, in which we analysed the dorsal and medial views of the astragalus, we decided to focus on the first view offering good separation of the two populations (Pöllath et al., 2018).

For data acquisition we took 2D photographs of each specimen, which was positioned in a sand-filled box with the surface horizontal controlled by a bubble level within a light box for controllable lighting.

Our reflex camera (Nikon D300) was coupled with a micro lens (AF-S Micro Nikkor 60 mm) and attached to the desk via an articulating arm.

Following the protocol of the pilot study (Pöllath et al., 2018), the first author digitised the coordinates of landmarks and sliding semi-landmarks using TpsDig2 v2.16 (Rohlf, 2010).

From the configurations tested in our pilot study, we chose the landmark (LM) configuration of the dorsal view combined with the proximal curve comprising 14 sliding semi-landmarks between landmarks (1) and (3) (Fig. 2, Table 2; Pöllath et al., 2018).

The specimens were superimposed in a Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) (Rohlf and Slice, 1990; Bookstein, 1991).

During GPA, the semi-landmarks are allowed to slide relative to each other in order to minimize the sum of Procrustes distances between the specimen and the mean shape (Bookstein, 1997; Gunz and Mitteroecker, 2013).

GMM procedures apart from data acquisition were performed with the functions of the ‘geomorph’ package (version 3.0.6; Adams et al., 2017) of R (version 3.4.3; R Core Team, 2018).

Since measurement error and sample size can pose serious problems in GMM analyses (Cardini et al., 2015; Fruciano, 2016), we first tested repeatability based on two digitization sessions using Procrustes ANOVA as proposed by Klingenberg and McIntyre (1998).

Sample size was checked with a sensitivity analysis (Cardini et al., 2015) employing the Munbāqa dataset, which is the largest in our study (n = 46).

The total sample was subdivided into 9 subsamples of 5 specimens, 4 of 10 specimens, 3 of 15 specimens and 2 of 23 specimens.

We then compared the variance-covariance matrix of each subsample with that of the total sample and calculated the adjusted RV with a threshold of 0.8.

PARAGRAPH

The presence of allometry amongst the datasets was tested using MANCOVA with Procrustes coordinates as dependent variables, log centroid size as independent variable and population as a factor combined with permutation tests for significance (1000 runs).

If allometry is present and the slopes for all populations are found to be parallel, the size-adjusted residuals will be obtained to get allometry-free shapes, which will then be used for subsequent analyses.

PARAGRAPH

The influence of sexual dimorphism and age on shape and size variation of the astragalus was tested for modern wild sheep as well as Karakul and Soay sheep because they represent uniform populations with sufficient age and sex data in more or less balanced numbers per category (Table 3).

The Marsch sheep population was excluded from this analysis because females outnumber males by far (17 to 6).

Twelve specimens had to be removed from the Soay assemblage since representing isolated bones lacking information about sex and age.

Three age groups were created in order to test if appositional growth occurring between juvenile, adult and senile age classes affected morphology: (a) younger than four years (juvenile and sub-adult), (b) between four and seven years (young adult) and (c) older than seven years (adult to senile).

We only included osteologically mature astragali, i.e. of animals older than six months (Pöllath et al., 2018).

When the astragalus is fully ossified longitudinal growth stops while appositional growth can continue throughout life (Popkin et al., 2012).

Therefore, only the impact of age-related appositional growth on shape will be examined here.

Sexual dimorphism and the influence of age on size and shape were analysed with a Procrustes ANOVA with randomized residual permutation procedure (1000 runs) combined with pairwise comparisons (Collyer et al., 2015).

PARAGRAPH

Although originally intended, we could not investigate the influence of mobility on astragalar shape due to the fact that flocks pertaining to the same population but witnessing either restricted or extensive movement are absent from our dataset.

Moreover, information on the nutrition of the different sheep populations is not detailed enough to be evaluated here.

Both aspects should be investigated in the future with better documented populations.

PARAGRAPH

Size differences between the populations are visualized with boxplots for log-transformed centroid size.

Shape differences between populations were tested with the allometry-free shape variables using Procrustes ANOVA with ‘shape’ as the dependent variable and ‘population’ as factor, followed by a randomized residual permutation procedure with 1000 runs and pairwise comparisons.

Subsequently, we performed a Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) to examine and visualize the divergence of shape in the astragalus of modern and archaeological populations.

Since CVA is the multi-group generalisation of discriminant analysis and since the number of specimens is relatively small compared to the number of variables, we performed Principal Component Analyses (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data by stepwise adding more principal components (see Baylac and Friess, 2005).

Finally, we visualized the similarities of the populations in performing a PCA for the mean shapes of each population and projecting the phenotypic tree into this space.

This tree was computed using the unrooted neighbor-joining (nj) algorithm (Saitou and Nei, 1987) based on the matrix of Euclidean distances between the mean shapes of the populations (Rohlf, 2002; Klingenberg and Gidaszewski, 2010).

The differences between the mean shapes of the domestic sheep populations and the wild sheep are illustrated by superimposing their warped shapes.

All statistical analyses were performed in R (version 3.4.3; R Core Team, 2018) using the R packages ‘geomorph’ (version 3.0.5; Adams et al., 2017), ‘Morpho’ (version 2.5.1), ‘ape’ (version 4.1) and ‘MatrixCorrelation’ (version 0.9.2).

Results

SECTION

Measurement error and sample size

PARAGRAPH

Measurement error for the configuration employed here accounts for 6.3% of the variance and is therefore unlikely to blur the differences found in the subsequent analyses.

The sensitivity analysis showed that in samples ≤10 specimens not a single subsample reached a correlation above the threshold value (RV adj > 0.8).

With a sample size of n = 15 only a single sub-sample out of three exceeded this value, whereas for two sub-samples comprising 23 specimens each, both surpassed the threshold value of 0.8 (Fig. 3).

This result compares well with that reported by Cardini et al. (2015), who analysed a slightly larger dataset totalling 50 specimens.

Based on our observations and those of Cardini et al. (2015) we conclude that sample size <15 specimens proved to be unreliable, while those sheep populations ≥23 specimens would provide meaningful results.

In our study only the ancient sheep population from Gusir Höyük did not reach this threshold value since comprising only 17 specimens (Table 1).

SECTION

The effect of sex and age on shape and size in modern sheep populations

PARAGRAPH

The Procrustes ANOVA test did reveal neither a significant effect of sex (F = 0.8343, df = 1, P = 0.654) nor of age on shape (F = 1.7020, df = 2, P = 0.097).

The same applies to the influence of sex and age on size (sex: F = 5.6075; df = 1, P = 0.260; age: F = 0.3345, df = 2, P = 0.740).

Since the influence of age and sex on shape was not significant, it was possible to pool specimens of all age and sex groups for subsequent analyses.

SECTION

Size differences and allometry in ancient and modern sheep populations

PARAGRAPH

Size differences as expressed by log centroid size are considerable (Fig. 4).

Soay sheep, for instance, overlap only slightly with other populations, while modern domestic sheep (Marsch and Karakul) are of similar size compared to the wild sheep hunted near Göbekli Tepe and Gusir Höyük.

Previous studies had already shown that the latter two populations matched well in size (e.g. Zimmermann et al., 2018: Fig. S10), allowing us to merge them into a single group.

Conversely, modern wild sheep from northern Iran not only were decidedly smaller than their ancient SE Anatolian relatives, but also than the aforementioned Marsch and Karakul sheep.

As such, the largest (male) individuals from the modern Iranian wild sheep population correspond in size with those found in the lower quartile of ancient wild sheep, likely corresponding to wild females.

PARAGRAPH

Allometry, i.e., the covariation of size and shape, was found to be significant in the MANCOVA (F = 15.7748, df = 1, P = 0.001), explaining 4.9% of the variation.

Since the interaction term of size and populations was not significant (F = 0.9794, df = 6, P = 0.471), we concluded that the populations share the same allometric trajectories, in other words, they exhibit parallel slopes.

We thus obtained size-adjusted residuals suitable for further analyses.

SECTION

Shape variation in modern and ancient sheep populations

PARAGRAPH

According to the Procrustes ANOVA test statistics, the variation in shape between the eight sheep populations is significant in general (F = 7.8486, df = 7, P = 0.001).

Population affiliations explain 22.5% of the variation as expressed by the coefficient of determination (R2).

The pairwise test revealed that the wild sheep hunted near Göbekli Tepe and Gusir Höyük did not differ from each other (Table 4 lower triangle); they demonstrate similar morphotypes, confirming the results of previous work (Pöllath et al., 2018).

It also follows that these two ancient wild populations can be merged into a single analytical unit totalling 53 specimens, thus eliminating the problem of small sample size at Gusir Höyük.

There are also no significant differences in shape between modern and ancient wild sheep, as demonstrated by p-values >0.2.

We nonetheless keep these two populations separate so that their phenotypic relationship and their positioning in the CVA can be investigated in more detail.

All other pairs tested showed statistically significant differences in shape, despite the fact that effect sizes (z scores) are not very large (Table 4 upper triangle).

PARAGRAPH

The phenotypic relationship between the different populations' mean shapes projected into the phylomorphospace demonstrates that modern wild sheep take a position between the domestic sheep from Middle Chalcolithic Güvercinkayası and the ancient wild sheep from Göbekli Tepe and Gusir Höyük (Fig. 5).

The two European sheep populations are located on the opposite branch of the phenotypic tree.

Marsch and Soay sheep match closely and are situated quite distantly from the other populations.

In between these two extremes the modern Karakul and the Late Bronze Age sheep from Munbāqa are situated.

As a whole, projection of the mean shapes in the phylomorphospace seems to reflect a geographic pattern, with Marsch and Soay sheep occupying the furthest position from the wild sheep populations.

The most pronounced divergence, however, separates the ancient wild sheep population from the Karakul.

PARAGRAPH

Canonical variate analysis (CVA) basically confirms the foregoing picture.

It exhibits a clear structuring of variation with both wild populations tightly packed in the lower left quarter of the diagram since possessing the most negative x-scores (Fig. 6).

The Karakul sheep plots in the opposite part of the diagram, i.e. in the upper right (or positive x/y-scores) quarter.

The four other domestic populations distribute between these two extremes, whereby the Marsch sheep and the feral Soay sheep position very close to each other in the lower right quarter of the diagram and the Late Bronze age Munbāqa sheep and the Middle Chalcolithic Güvercinkayası sheep in the upper left quarter.

The latter two seem to be more closely related according to the CVA.

In this respect, the first canonical variate axis explains 52.0% of the variation, the second 30.7%.

PARAGRAPH

Shape differences between the five domestic populations and ancient wild sheep are illustrated in Fig. 7.

Central Anatolian Güvercinkayası sheep hardly diverge from SE Anatolian wild (Fig. 7a).

In the first, the medial edge between Landmarks 3 and 6 as well as the lateral part of the caput between Landmarks 7 and 8 are broader, while the lateral edge of the trochlea between Landmarks 9 and 11 is somewhat narrower.

In the two groups the proximal curves appear almost identical.

It is also noted that the Marsch and the Soay sheep show very similar deviations from the wild sheep shape (Fig. 7b, c): The edge of the lateral trochlea is broader, the position of the intersection of the lateral muscle scars (Landmark 10) is much more lateral and –similar to Güvercinkayası –, the lateral part of the caput is rather narrow.

The proximal curve is quite symmetrical in Marsch and Soay sheep; it lacks the small protrusion typical for wild sheep astragali.

These characteristics seem more clearly expressed in Marsch sheep compared to Soays.

The Munbāqa and Karakul sheep also share several characteristics setting them apart from wild sheep (Fig. 7d, e): Both are narrow at the medial edge of the trochlea, the intersection of the muscle scar locates more laterally, and the proximal curve is even more symmetrical compared to its homologue in European sheep.

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

According to our preliminary analyses dealing with measurement error and sample size sensitivity, the datasets exploited here can be considered statistically meaningful in a way that neither measurement error nor sample size issues seem to affect the outcome of the analyses performed.

Thus archaeological and modern populations comprising at least between 20 and 25 specimens can be evaluated without concern.

Once sample size drops below 20 specimens interpretation of the results must be done with care: if CVA or MANOVA analyses are planned, reduction of dimensionality as proposed by Baylac and Friess (2005) should be applied (see also Evin et al., 2013).

SECTION

Size and shape variation in ancient and modern wild sheep populations

PARAGRAPH

From the analysis based on centroid size, it can be seen that modern wild sheep from NW Iran proved to be considerably smaller in size than Neolithic wild sheep from the Eastern Taurus and Western Zagros mountains (Fig. 4), raising the question why this is the case.

One reason for this could be trophy hunting targeting primarily large males, particularly after the introduction of fire arms.

As could be shown for bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), trophy hunting not only led to a decrease in average horn size but also to a decline in body mass, since the large-horned, heavy-bodied males are often eliminated at an age before they had experienced the peak of their mating success (Coltman et al., 2003; Pigeon et al., 2016).

Consequently, less dominant males can take their position, reproduce and pass on their genetic make-up, which over time will have a negative effect on average size in such populations.

Another possible cause for the size decrease observed in SW Asian wild sheep relates to anthropogenic habitat fragmentation and landscape deterioration.

Additionally, increased competition for food with domestic livestock will take place in these fragmented and deteriorated habitats provoking worse foraging conditions for wild animals eventually resulting in a reduction of body mass as well (Rosvold et al., 2014).

This kind of situation is well documented in other wild ungulate taxa, such as red deer, roe deer, elk or wild boar (see compilation in Rosvold et al., 2014).

In this respect, habitat fragmentation is also one of the most serious threats to the remaining wild Ovis populations in Iran (Bashari and Hemami, 2013).

Finally, hybridization between domestic and wild sheep might offer another explanation for the decrease in average body size and weight over the last 10,000 years.

Since mobile sheep pastoralism is widely practised in the natural habitat of wild sheep, introgression over the millennia seems particularly relevant (Bashari and Hemami, 2013).

However, for the moment hybridisation and its effects are largely unstudied, hence little is known about the intensity of gene flow between domestic and wild sheep and, if the case, whether this could explain the smaller size observed in free-ranging sheep hunted in 20th century Iran.

Having said that, GMM analyses of the astragalus from this Ovis population illustrate no significant change in shape at all.

PARAGRAPH

Size differences between the aforementioned wild sheep and the other populations investigated here meet expectations.

The small size of the Güvercinkayası sheep illustrates well the lower shoulder height of post-Neolithic sheep flocks (Benecke, 1994).

The rather extreme small size of the Soay sheep is explained by the insular effect of the remote St. Kilda archipelago and the suboptimal living conditions experienced there (Clutton-Brock et al., 1990).

Conversely, the large size of modern Marsch and Karakul sheep mirrors the success of modern breeding and selection.

Finally, the intermediate size of the Munbāqa sheep population has already been noted elsewhere and merits further consideration.

Influence of sex and age on astragalar shape

PARAGRAPH

GMM analysis of astragali from modern wild and domestic sheep populations demonstrated that neither the factor ‘sex’ nor ‘age’ significantly influenced the shape of the astragalus captured with our landmark configuration.

This is in clear contrast with the factor ‘population’, which proved significant in all cases.

The fact that an animal's sex does not affect the astragalar shape might not be that surprising in view of the fact that sexual size dimorphism in sheep is distinctly less pronounced compared to other medium-sized bovids, for instance in Capra, and minimal in many prehistoric populations as well as modern domestic breeds (Polák and Frynta, 2009; Ghafouri-Kesbi and Notter, 2016).

Sheep astragali were also found to exhibit minimal osteometric variation between sexes in general (Davis, 2000; Popkin et al., 2012).

Apart from this, sexual size dimorphism is expressed best in those elements of the appendicular skeleton experiencing a proportionately larger amount of weight.

In bovids, this is the case in the bones of the forelimb demonstrably bearing about two thirds of the total weight mainly because of the head characterized by heavy horns and corresponding massive soft tissues in males (e.g. Fernández and Monchot, 2007).

Whether this peculiarity affects the shape of the bone elements of the forelimb is currently investigated with the distal humerus.

PARAGRAPH

That age effects the shape of the astragalus is to be expected, since appositional growth demonstrably continues into advanced age (Davis, 2000; Popkin et al., 2012).

However, landmarks have been exclusively positioned on the articular surfaces (Fig. 2) where appositional growth generally does not occur.

It is therefore unlikely to capture appositional growth with the 2D approach used here.

It also remains to be seen if a 3D approach, currently under way, allows us to detect and quantify appositional growth.

In this respect, analyses based on traditional length and breadth measurements confirm that appositional growth can be traced, but only along the medio-lateral plane of the distal part of the Caput tali, which is captured by the distal Breadth (Bd) (Popkin et al., 2012).

Compared to the astragalus, long bones experiencing strain, such as tibia or humerus are more likely to show appositional growth (Davis, 2000; Popkin et al., 2012).

SECTION

Phenotypic relationships between populations and their interpretation

PARAGRAPH

From the foregoing it can be seen that sheep populations can be discriminated by their astragalar shape.

However, the differentiation described in a previous paper between ancient wild and modern Karakul sheep (Pöllath et al., 2018) does not turn out as clear-cut the moment more populations are added to the analysis.

As such, the two modern domestic sheep populations as well as the two archaeological domestic sheep populations position between the extremes formed by the wild sheep on the one hand and the Karakul on the other, indicating that differences in astragalar shape are minor with considerable overlap between the different populations.

PARAGRAPH

Most notably, the differences in shape separating the two modern sheep populations from Halle (Karakul and Marsch) are certainly not due to their respective living conditions, since broadly similar.

Therefore, shape differences are obviously rooted in the populations' breeding histories, during which both lineages developed into distinct ecomorphotypes well-adapted to the specific conditions of their local environments, i.e. the arid steppe of continental Central Asia versus the wetlands characterizing coastal NW Europe, and/or into separate functional morphotypes through human selection for wool (both breeds) and fat (Karakul only).

From Mesopotamian iconography we know that the emergence of wool and fat-tailed sheep predates or coincides with the beginning of the Early Bronze Age (3300–2100 BCE): One of the earliest representations of fat-tailed sheep dates to the Uruk III period (ca. 3000 BCE; Zeuner, 1963), while the earliest pictorial evidence for wool sheep dates to the mid-4th millennium BCE (Benecke, 1994; Arbuckle, 2014).

Osteometric comparison of sheep remains reveal the appearance of larger sheep in Mesopotamia during the Bronze Age (Vila, 2002; Pollock, 1999; Vila and Helmer, 2014).

Chronologically, the presence of larger-bodied sheep at Munbāqa, which according to the size diagram (Fig. 4) were integrated into the flocks of smaller-sized sheep, agrees with this development.

Some authors reject the hypothesis assuming the arrival of a new type of sheep and explain the appearance of larger-individuals with the fact that less male sheep were culled when young in order to increase wool production (Benecke, 1994; Arbuckle, 2014).

However, size diagrams for sheep from Mesopotamia (Vila, 2002: Fig. 4) not only show that in sheep average size increases, but also that individuals occur that surpass in size the largest males from preceding periods (see also Vila and Helmer, 2014).

This cannot be explained solely by a shift in exploitation towards more adult male sheep to increase wool production.

Complementary to the osteometric evidence for two types of sheep, Vila and Helmer (2014) also noted a first type of sheep with a woolly coat and coiled horns and a second one with a hairy coat possessing spiral horns in the contemporary iconography of Mesopotamia.

They tentatively identify the large-sized type as hairy and the small-sized type as wool sheep, thus contradicting the hypothesis of large-sized sheep being bred for wool.

To these, a third type must be added, namely a fat-tailed sheep depicted in the contemporary art of Mesopotamia.

Interestingly, the large majority of modern European sheep breeds including the Marsch sheep bear wool but do not possess localized fat depots in the caudal region.

Conversely, all sub-Saharan fat-tailed sheep are hair breeds (Gifford-Gonzalez and Hanotte, 2011).

Consequently, separate selection criteria and distinct events of dispersal must be postulated, one involving wool-bearing animals to Europe and another involving fat-tailed animals to Africa.

Interestingly, many Asian sheep lineages such as the Karakul possess wool and fat tails, thus implying cross-breeding.

Early Bronze Age cuneiform texts from Ur III already mention such multi-purpose animals (Sallaberger, 2014).

This suggests that ancient Mesopotamia may have been the region of origin for the selection of both traits.

PARAGRAPH

Turning to genetic studies, recent mitogenome analyses showed that most fat-tailed breeds pertain to haplogroup C (Lv et al., 2015).

It may therefore be tempting to equate fat-tailed lineages with this haplogroup.

However, most Karakul sheep possess either haplogroup A or B (Tapio et al., 2006).

Consequently, the divergence in shape between Anatolian wild sheep and Karakul sheep cannot be explained at the mitogenomic level.

As long as the loci for either wool or excessive localized fat depots remain unknown in the nuclear genome (Moradi et al., 2012; Schroeder et al., 2017), the study of retrovirus insertions in the latter seems better suited to resolve sheep dispersal on a genetic basis (Chessa et al., 2009; Schroeder et al., 2017).

Based on the presence/absence of four retrovirus insertions these authors defined retrotypes and proposed two waves of sheep dispersal to Europe and Central Asia, a first wave dating to the Neolithic and a second during the Bronze Age linked with the secondary introduction of an improved sheep type originating from SW Asia after selectively breeding sheep for wool.

A similar approach tracing the emergence and dispersal of sheep with excessive fat depots is currently not available.

PARAGRAPH

In sum, if we combine the results of our GMM study and those obtained from ancient DNA, traditional archaeozoology, iconography and cuneiform sources, sheep obviously witnessed several dispersal waves in prehistoric times, including a first involving early domestic sheep during the Neolithic, a second involving wool sheep and a third involving fat-tailed sheep, the latter two occurring in post-Neolithic times, probably during the Bronze Age.

The minor divergence in shape of the Güvercinkayası sheep from SE Anatolian wild sheep and its significant divergence from all other populations implies that later dispersal waves (wool, fat) likely reached Central Anatolia after site occupation had come to an end ~4750 BCE.

The position of the Soay and the Marsch sheep on the same branch in the neighbor-joining tree (Fig. 5) with the Soay sheep placed closer to the node also conforms well with the latter being a relic population of the first wave and Marsch sheep likely representing a lineage combining the shape of sheep from both waves.

Finally, the Late Bronze Age sheep from Munbāqa and the Karakul are both placed on separate but neighbouring branches, which both are rather long.

Based on the distance to the Marsch sheep and the proximity to the Karakul we hypothesize that the larger sheep of Munbāqa possessed excessive fat depots rather than a woolly coat.

Since the Munbāqa flocks still included smaller-sized animals (Fig. 4) similarities in shape with Güvercinkayası sheep are to be expected.

For the moment the presence of fat-tailed sheep at Bronze Age Munbāqa is only assumed and will need further analysis.

Similarly, answering the issue whether Karakul and Marsch sheep represent distinct ecomorphotypes necessitates appropriate datasets generated with additional sheep populations adapted to the living conditions of specific landscapes.

SECTION

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

First and foremost, our comparative study of astragalar shape demonstrates the potential of GMM to separate wild from domestic sheep and to document phenotypic differences in sheep.

We could show that differences and similarities in shape first addressed in a pilot study (Pöllath et al., 2018) did not relate to the sex and age of the animals investigated but reflected their affiliation to the respective population.

However, the picture obtained initially separating nicely wild sheep and domestic Karakul became less clear when including additional populations.

Based on the larger dataset our analyses strongly suggest that besides a domestic or wild status, shape differences also reflect the species' phylogeography, more precisely the geographically structured genetic signal in domestic sheep, as well as chronological patterning.

We therefore conclude that GMM is an important tool for tracing the cultural trajectory of prehistoric sheep.

Of course, many questions regarding the emergence of sheep types possessing desired traits will need to be answered applying biomolecular analyses, but for framing spatio-temporal aspects of the process, GMM seems particularly useful.

The approach moreover is archaeologically advantageous, since it is non-invasive, able to process large numbers of specimens and – above all – needed to step in the breach when DNA preservation is poor, which is the case in many regions of Mesopotamia witnessing hot and arid climatic conditions.

Finally, by combining this kind of GMM analysis with traditional archaeozoological approaches new vistas can be opened up.

By integrating morphotype analysis and demographic profiles in single populations, for instance, we expect new light to be shed on the transition from ancient Near Eastern sheep economies focussing on meat (and milk) to more advanced production systems exploiting the species also for additional lifetime and primary products, such as wool and fat.
