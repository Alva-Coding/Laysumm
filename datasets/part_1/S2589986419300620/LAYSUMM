TITLE

Autistic features in Unverricht–Lundborg disease

PARAGRAPH

Unverricht–Lundborg disease (ULD) is an autosomal recessive progressive myoclonic epileptic disorder characterized by onset at the age of 6–15 years, severe incapacitating stimulus-sensitive progressive myoclonus, tonic–clonic epileptic seizures, absence seizures and characteristic abnormalities in the electroencephalogram.

Neuropsychiatric disturbances like depression and anxiety and cognitive impairment are a recognized feature of Unverricht-Lundborg disease.

However the unique social features seen in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) may not be a recognized feature of ULD.

We found autistic (mainly social or behavioral) features in three patients of ULS and concluded that identifying autism in ULD patients could be important.
