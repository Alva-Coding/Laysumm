TITLE

An evaluation of classical morphologic and morphometric parameters reported to distinguish wolves and dogs

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Researchers have examined the origins of dogs for over a century (Galton, 1865; Gaudry and Boule, 1892; Huxley, 1880; Nehring, 1888; Rütimeyer, 1861; Studer, 1901; Verworn et al., 1919; Wolfgram, 1894) and have used specific morphometric and morphological criteria to assign specimens as dog or wolf.

PARAGRAPH

Some of these assignment criteria have been rejected, including:

backward turning of the dorsal part of the vertical mandibular ramus (Olsen and Olsen, 1977), because the feature is present in both dogs and wolves (Janssens et al., 2016a);

variations in types and frequencies of oral and dental abnormalities such as tooth agenesis or occlusion-related pathology (Andersone and Ozolins, 2000; Stockhaus, 1965; Vila et al., 1993; Wobeser, 1992) that are similar among wolves and dogs (Janssens et al., 2016b);

paedomorphosis (juvenile appearance in dogs) (Morey, 1994; Waller et al., 2013) for which the typical morphological criteria are lacking in dogs (Drake, 2011);

tooth crowding in dogs (Benecke, 1994; Wolfgram, 1894) that occurs also in wolves (Ameen et al., 2017);

larger tympanic bulla in wolves (Benecke, 1987; Bökönyi, 1975; Zeuner, 1963) that is not species-specific, but is related isometrically to stature (Stockhaus, 1965);

differences in the sum of maxillary mesio-distal diameters of M1 + M2, being less than P4 in dogs and greater in wolves (Clutton-Brock, 1963); many possible variations exist in dogs and wolves (Gaudry and Boule, 1892; Wolfgram, 1894);

reduced sagittal crest in dogs (Studer, 1901) (bony protuberance in midline sagittal suture line located at the level of the parietal bones) given that dogs are quite variable in this criteria (Lawrence and Bossert, 1967; Rizk, 2012);

clear difference in orbital angle (OA) between dogs and wolves (Bockelmann, 1920; Iljin, 1941; Studer, 1901) that was contradicted by a recent study showing there was full overlap between archaeological dogs and modern wolves (Janssens et al., 2016c);

convex mandible in dogs versus a straight one in wolves (Germonpré et al., 2015; Lawrence and Reed, 1983), that was agreed on in modern samples but incorrect in archaeological samples (Drake et al., 2017).

PARAGRAPH

Several anatomical criteria are accepted today, and are used routinely to classify candidate archaeological canids as dog or wolf.

However, documenting observations may include relatively few reference individuals, or results can be contradictory (Aaris-Sørensen, 2004; Clutton-Brock, 1962; Clutton-Brock, 1963; Davis and Valla, 1978; Dayan, 1994a; Degerbøl, 1961; Lawrence and Bossert, 1967; Musil, 2000).

Among these criteria are:

SECTION

More “massive” mandibles in dogs

PARAGRAPH

Differences in mass have been reported between wolf and dog mandibles.

Massive mandibles were defined as deep dorso-ventrally (high) and thick latero-medially (wide) in some prehistoric canids that were identified as dogs (Clutton-Brock, 1962; Germonpré et al., 2015; Lawrence and Bossert, 1967; Tchernov and Horwitz, 1991).

The problem is that mass is not defined objectively as an index of width (breadth), length, and height.

Here we discuss published mandibular measurements to define mass, comparing mandibular length, width, and height.

SECTION

Width

PARAGRAPH

There are two useful studies on mandible width (maximal transverse distance at M1-measure 17), in Von den Driesch (1976).

Lawrence and Reed (1983: 490–494) found dog mandibles from Jarmo (Iraq, 8 kya) to be wider than those of local recent wolves (C. l. pallipes or arabs) and comparable to “Eskimo dogs”, which the authors consider to be an “archaic breed”.

This finding was used as an argument to identify the specimens as dogs.

The second study (Germonpré et al., 2015: 12) measured canid mandibles from the archaeological site of Předmostí (Czech Republic, 27–24 kya) and divided them into two morphotypes: a dog-like massive type (proposed to be a Paleolithic dog) and a slender type (proposed to be a Pleistocene wolf).

There was a significant difference between modern wolves and the proposed Paleolithic dogs, but not between the latter group and the Pleistocene wolves.

SECTION

Height

PARAGRAPH

Three studies on mandibular height (the maximal sagittal height of the horizontal ramus of the mandible at the molars - Von den Driesch (1976; 60); measure 19) present conflicting data.

Tchernov and Valla (1997) found this height significantly greater (p < 0.0001) in modern Middle Eastern wolves, as compared to Natufian dogs (Levant, 15–11.5 kya) (Grossman, 2013).

This seems logical as mandible height has been correlated with body mass (Losey et al., 2015).

Dimitrijević (2006) and Dimitrijević and Vuković (2012) found mandibles from Mesolithic and Neolithic dogs in the Danube Gorges to be taller than in archaeological and recent local wolves.

Germonpré et al. (2015: 12) measured three different mandibular heights (between P2–3 (Von den Driesch measurement 20), P3–4, and M1–2) but no significant statistical difference was found between the mandibular heights of proposed Paleolithic dogs and Pleistocene wolves at Předmostí.

SECTION

Length

PARAGRAPH

One study reports mandible length (Von den Driesch (1976), measures 1, 2, 3) and other dimensions of 130 canid skulls from the Gravettian site of Předmostí (Czech Republic) and compared these to modern wolves and dogs, using uni- and multivariate statistical methods (Germonpré et al., 2015).

Ten metrics were evaluated (for details see Table 1) including (a) three mandibular lengths; (b) several tooth row lengths (total length, several premolar and molar lengths); (c) two individual tooth lengths (M1 and C); (d) two widths (mandible and M1); and (e) three heights.

Tooth row lengths also have been studied by several other authors reporting on tooth row length reduction (most premolar) in dogs compared to wolves (Benecke, 1987; Benecke, 1994; Boudadi-Maligne, 2010; Bökönyi, 1975; Clutton-Brock, 1995; Dayan, 1994b; Dimitrijević and Vuković, 2012; Morey, 2010; Nehring, 1888; Napierala and Uerpmann, 2012; Studer, 1901; Tchernov and Horwitz, 1991; Tchernov and Valla, 1997; Wolfgram, 1894; Zeuner, 1963).

The results of the Předmostí study (Germonpré et al., 2015) were that 28% of the total canids at the site had nine statistically significant shorter length metrics (Von den Driesch (1976) mandibular measures 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and13a) than the others, and these were identified as Paleolithic dogs (versus wolves).

Some caution is advised about data of this nature.

Multiple measurements taken from the same structure (mandible) directly imply non-independence among the measurements, and increase the likelihood that the traits will be correlated based on size.

Cluster analysis followed by significance tests attempting to detect subgroups in such a dataset is actually a circular way of statistical thinking.

If one takes a sample of morphological measurements, then looks for the highest differences on the basis of a cluster analysis, and then statistically tests if these two most different groups are significantly different, almost any dataset would yield significant p-values.

It is thus very likely to find such differences even when the sample comes from a homogeneous group of specimens (as in our test in of German shepherds, see below).

SECTION

Contact points of the skull

PARAGRAPH

Different contact points of the skull on a horizontal plane, with wolves resting on bullae and canine teeth and dogs on bullae and P4 (Benecke, 1987; Zeuner, 1963) Zeuner (1963) explained the difference as due to the larger canines in wolves (Fig. 2).

SECTION

Position of the caudal border of the hard palate

PARAGRAPH

Different position of the caudal border of the hard palate, being more caudal in dogs, so that the line connecting caudal M2, lies cranial to that border in dogs, caudal in wolves (Benecke, 1987; Iljin, 1941).

However, not all agree (Mihelic et al., 2013; Schwabenlander et al., 2015) (Fig. 3).

SECTION

Smaller stature and size and skull size

PARAGRAPH

Smaller stature and size and skull size are accepted widely as domestication signals documenting dogs (Table 6) (Benecke, 1994; Boudadi-Maligne et al., 2012; Clutton-Brock, 1962; Clutton-Brock, 2012; Dayan, 1994b; Degerbøl, 1961; Mertens, 1936; Napierala and Uerpmann, 2012; Pitulko and Kasparov, 2017; Pluskowski, 2006; Rütimeyer, 1861; Wolfgram, 1894; Zeuner, 1963).

PARAGRAPH

Smaller skull size (mainly lengths were measured) has been reported widely as a feature of early domesticated dogs (Aaris-Sørensen, 1977; Andersone and Ozolins, 2000; Benecke, 1987; Chaix, 2000; Degerbøl, 1961; Dimitrijević, 2006; Germonpré et al., 2009; Harrison, 1973; Jolicoeur, 1959; Lüpz, 1974; Mertens, 1936; Morey, 2014; Nehring, 1888; Okarma and Buchalczyk, 1993; Ovodov et al., 2011; Pidoplichko et al., 2001; Rütimeyer, 1861; Sablin and Khlopachev, 2002; Studer, 1901; Sumiński, 1975; Wolfgram, 1894), and is reported to be isometrically to stature and size reduction (Losey et al., 2015; Wayne, 1986).

PARAGRAPH

Reduced skull length (TL) of >25% was reported in three first-generation wolves (TL: 161–175 mm) born in a zoo, to wild-caught parents (TL: 225–272 mm) (Nehring, 1888; Wolfgram, 1894), but not in wild wolves, caught as sub-adults and then maintained in a zoo (Wolfgram, 1894).

This was considered an indication for size reduction as a result of domestication if pups were part of the anthropogenic environment from early on.

PARAGRAPH

However as skull size (and stature-size) are influenced by naturally-occurring prey preferences in wolves, as well as by geographical and climatological influences (Geffen et al., 2004; Leonard et al., 2002; Muñoz-Fuentes et al., 2009; Perri, 2016; Perri and Sazelova, 2016; Pilot et al., 2006; Pilot et al., 2010; Pilot et al., 2012), relatively large differences in skull length do not necessarily point to wolf-dog distinctions.

SECTION

Carnassial size reduction

PARAGRAPH

Carnassial size reduction (maxillary P4 and mandibular M1) (Tables 8, 9) has been reported by many authors as a concise signal of domestication (Clutton-Brock, 1962; Lawrence and Reed, 1983; Morey, 1992; Morey, 1994; Morey, 2010; Tchernov and Horwitz, 1991; Tchernov and Valla, 1997).

Yet, in the earliest dogs, this phenomenon is allometric when compared to skull size reduction (Clutton-Brock, 1962; Huxley, 1880; Lawrence and Bossert, 1967; Lawrence and Reed, 1983; Morey, 1992; Zeuner, 1963).

Early reports report skull size reductions of 25%, with carnassial length reductions of only 5% (Huxley, 1880).

Nehring (1888) reported a 25% skull size reduction in three Eurasian wolf siblings, born in the Berlin Zoo, compared to their wild-caught parents, while their carnassials were reduced <18%.

The reason for this disproportion is that tooth size is 80% determined by genetic factors contrary to body and skull size (Dempsey and Townsend, 2001; Howe et al., 1983) and thus more conservative.

A delayed tooth size reduction, compared to other cranial elements, is likely to complicate early wolf/dog distinctions, as seen with M1 (See below) (Table 9).

SECTION

Micro-anatomical tooth differences

PARAGRAPH

Assignment of a specimen to the dog or wolf group may depend on minute differences in the anatomy of a single tooth, with small differences in shape and size of meta-, hypo-, proto-, paracone, protostyle and cingulum (Colyer, 1990).

Particularly, the shape of the protocone has been used as a distinctive landmark (Camarós et al., 2016; Napierala and Uerpmann, 2012) (Fig. 6).

Based on the presence of a distinctive protocone on P4 in dogs and its (presumed) near-absence in wolves, a new Paleolithic dog from the Aurignacian (Hohle Fels) recently was proposed (Camarós et al., 2016).

This specimen shows a prominent protocone on P4 (Fig. 5).

SECTION

Shorter and wider snouts

PARAGRAPH

Shorter and wider snouts are the most frequently reported characteristics used to argue for the identity of a dog specimen (Clutton-Brock, 1995; Crockford, 2005; Drake, 2011; Horard-Herbin et al., 2014; Huxley, 1880; Koler-Matznick, 2002; Morey, 1992; Napierala and Uerpmann, 2012; Nehring, 1888; Studer, 1901; Mertens, 1936; Iljin, 1941; Degerbøl, 1961; Germonpré et al., 2009; Stockhaus, 1965; Lawrence and Bossert, 1967; Olsen, 1985; Olsen and Olsen, 1977; Sablin and Khlopachev, 2002; Wayne, 1986).

However, not all studies agree and there exists no concise overview to compare the results from all published studies (Table 10).

SECTION

Shorter snouts

PARAGRAPH

Shorter snouts in dogs have been subjective measures and co-existing tooth crowding has been attributed to the consequences of shortening (Benecke, 1987; Benecke, 1994; Bökönyi, 1975; Clutton-Brock, 1995; Crockford, 2005; Dayan, 1994a; Degerbøl, 1961; Drake, 2011; Iljin, 1941; Germonpré et al., 2009; Horard-Herbin et al., 2014; Huxley, 1880; Iljin, 1941; Koler-Matznick, 2002; Lawrence and Bossert, 1967; Mertens, 1936; Morey, 1992; Napierala and Uerpmann, 2012; Nehring, 1888; Olsen, 1985; Olsen and Olsen, 1977; Ovodov et al., 2011; Pidoplichko, 1998; Rütimeyer, 1861; Sablin and Khlopachev, 2002; Stockhaus, 1965; Studer, 1901; Zeuner, 1963).

Snout length likely is in part genetically determined, but also can be influenced by environment and diet composition (Aron, 1911; Beecher and Corrucini, 1981; McCance and Ford, 1961).

PARAGRAPH

The snout length ratio/index is derived by dividing a possible snout length measure (Von den Driesch (1976) measurements 8, 9, 12, or 13), by skull length (TL, CbL, BL; Von den Driesch, 1976 measurement 1, 2, 3) (Table 12).

Most studies use the ratio 8/2.

Several authors have calculated relative snout length indexes (Table 10), in total on 1034 modern dogs, 68 archaeological dogs, and 442 modern wolves.

Eleven studies measured skull length and/or snout width and length; two of these were GM studies (Rizk, 2012; Schmitt and Wallace, 2012) and nine were classical morphometric studies (Arensburg, 2004; Benecke, 1994; Lüpz, 1974; Morey, 1994; Nehring, 1884; Stockhaus, 1965; Studer, 1901; Tchernov and Valla, 1997; Wayne, 1986).

Among existing reports, only Tchernov and Valla (1997) observed shortening, and only in the pre-maxillary region.

Lack of snout shortening in dogs also is reported from GM studies (Drake et al., 2015; Rizk, 2012; Schmitt and Wallace, 2012) that suggest partial length reduction, compensated by partial length increase (Table 10).

SECTION

Wider snouts

PARAGRAPH

Snout width is the greatest breadth of the palate (GPB) (Von den Driesch, 1976, measurement 34) divided by skull length.

Studies that measured snout width ratio (Table 10) (Morey, 1994; Stockhaus, 1965; Studer, 1901; Tchernov and Valla, 1997; Wayne, 1986) reported almost all wider snouts (Table 10).

Only Tchernov and Valla (1997) reported narrower snouts, but used Von den Driesch (1976) measurement 35 (the smallest snout width), not 34.

Wider snouts also are supported by GM studies (Rizk, 2012; Schmitt and Wallace, 2012).

SECTION

Higher snout and skull indexes in dogs

PARAGRAPH

In a recent study of Early Holocene, Neolithic canids from Zhokov (Russia), Pitulko and Kasparov (2017) proposed two new skull height ratios to differentiate dogs from wolves (Fig. 6).

Both ratios are calculated by dividing a specific nasal or skull height by basal length (BL, measure 3 from Von den Driesch, 1976).

The snout height (DD1) is measured at maxillary P1–2.

The skull/cranium height (DD2) is measured at the post-orbital constriction at the level of the zygomatic processes of the frontal bone (Fig. 8).

The mean DD1 and DD2 reported in the original study were measured in two archaeological dog specimens (DD1 mean 0.19; DD2 0.37).

In wolves from the same Neolithic site (n = 24), the measurements were DD1 mean 0.17 (range 0.16–0.18); DD2 0.34 (range 0.32–0.36).

SECTION

The enigma of proposed large Paleolithic dogs

PARAGRAPH

In 2009, dog domestication was proposed to have occurred about 20,000 years earlier than previously assumed, an assertion based primarily on one large canid from Goyet (34 kya) in Belgium (Germonpré et al., 2009).

Previous reports also had proposed earlier Paleolithic dog specimens, but these publications had not gained much traction.

The latter reports included one specimen from Mezhirich (Mezhyrich) (c. 14.5 kya) (Pidoplichko et al., 2001; Pidoplichko, 1998) and two from Eliseevichi (c. 17 kya) (Sablin and Khlopachev, 2002).

PARAGRAPH

More recently, 6 more insipient or proto-dogs were reported, bringing the total to 10: Hohle Fels (Aurignacian) (Camarós et al., 2016), Goyet, Mezin 5–490 and Mezhirich 4493/24 (Germonpré et al., 2009), Razboinichya (Ovodov et al., 2011), “Předmostí 1069” (also numbered 1063 or 3), “Předmostí 1060”, “Předmostí–” (Germonpré et al., 2012) and Ulakhan Sular (Germonpré et al., 2017) (Tables 6, 12, 13).

Another Razboinichya specimen was classified as a Paleolithic dog based on a caudally oriented coronoid process, a shorter and wider snout, P4 length less than M1 + M2, and shorter skull length (TL 211 mm).

Several concerns about these specimens have been published, adding emphasis to our concerns.

SECTION

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

We propose that these generally accepted criteria require reanalysis based on larger datasets.

Here, we address this need for critical re-evaluation by combining new and prior data to create an updated reference framework including several of the older publications, often not in English, that have been poorly consulted by the English scientific community.

We explain questions of robustness, our measurements, and the outcomes, and illustrate our findings by reconsidering earlier reports of large Pleistocene canids (Camarós et al., 2016; Germonpré et al., 2009; Germonpré et al., 2012; Germonpré et al., 2015; Germonpré et al., 2017; Ovodov et al., 2011; Pidoplichko et al., 2001; Sablin and Khlopachev, 2002).

SECTION

Materials and methods

PARAGRAPH

We studied adult wolf and dog skeletal specimens from collections that are curated at the Museum of Natural History, Switzerland (NMBE); the Department of Vertebrate Zoology, Smithsonian Institute at the National Museum of Natural History, Washington DC, USA (NMNH); the Department of Anatomy, School for Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Belgium (UGFVM); the Department of Zoology, George S. Wise Faculty of Life Sciences, Tel-Aviv University, Israel (ZMTAU); Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Sydney, Australia (VFMSA); Museum für Naturkunde, Leibniz Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity Science (MfN-ZMB) and the Rheinisches Landesmuseum für Archäologie, Kunst- und Kulturgeschichte, Bonn, Germany (LVR).

These collections were consulted because of their amount and/or variety of wolf and/or dog specimens and in some cases the availability of both recent and/or archaeological remains.

PARAGRAPH

Remains of Pleistocene dogs are extremely rare (<10 specimens) (Table 6) and partial.

Specimens found in the Pleistocene-Holocene transition are as rare, and also partial, although several incomplete skulls were excavated (Table 6).

In the Mesolithic more dog specimens were found, especially in the Danube Gorges (Bökönyi, 1975; Dimitrijević, 2006; Dimitrijević and Vuković, 2012).

But large collections only appear in the Neolithic, specifically in Scandinavia (Janssens et al., 2016c) and the Alpine lakes (Rütimeyer, 1875; Becker and Johansson, 1981).

The Swedish collection contains very few specimens, unavailable for thorough research because they are embedded in en block cases, the Danish collection is large but was unavailable for research.

The Swiss collection is large and was available for research.

All measurements are in mm and according to the definitions detailed in Von den Driesch (1976).

When partial collections were used, selection was without a priori verification of samples and following simple principles (e.g. all samples from the top drawers or all samples from the left cupboard).

The samples used from these collections are detailed below, when each examined criterion is reported.

PARAGRAPH

We specifically re-examined the following criteria:

SECTION

Mandible length

PARAGRAPH

We examined a modern German shepherd sample of 75 skulls (NMBE collection) that was measured in exactly the same way as in the study that divided the 130 canid skulls from the Gravettian site of Předmostí into two subgroups of dogs or wolves (Germonpré et al., 2015) (Table 1), We used cluster analysis to identify subgroups.

Nine length parameters were measured (See Section 1.1 and Table 1).

Our skulls had a restricted regional and temporal distribution (Switzerland, 150 years) and represent a very homogeneous group (bred to construct a breed) if compared to canids from a wide region and long timespan (Předmosti).

SECTION

Contact points of the skull on a horizontal plane

PARAGRAPH

We examined 151 modern dog skulls of 33 breeds, from the NMBE and UGFVM collections, along with 55 modern wolf skulls of four subspecies, from three collections (NMBE, ZMTA, NMNH) (Table 3).

Contact point stability was categorized as on canines or P4, but data were inconclusive if bilateral symmetry was lacking or stability was on C and P4 simultaneously (Fig. 3).

SECTION

Caudal shifting of the border of the hard palate

PARAGRAPH

We examined a sample of 39 modern wolves of four subspecies, 52 Neolithic dogs, and 175 modern dogs (of which 75 German shepherds) of 25 breeds (Tables 4, 5).

We photographed each skull intra-orally (Fig. 4) then drew a digital line touching the left and right caudal borders of M2.

Skulls were categorized based on the hard palate border being rostral (wolf-like) or caudal to the M2 line (dog-like).

If asymmetry was observed (one side rostral, the other caudal to this line) or if the line coincided with the caudal border, specimens were categorized as inconclusive.

SECTION

Skull size reduction as a parameter for stature reduction

PARAGRAPH

We searched the literature for skull length differences in modern wild and zoo wolves.

PARAGRAPH

We tested whether smaller skull length is human-driven (Wolfgram, 1894) or the result of unknown environmental drivers (possibly present in the 19th century zoo).

From the from the ZMTAU collection we examined body weight and skull length (TL) of wild wolves and first and second generation wolves born in the institute (out of wild captured animals from all over Israel) (Tables 7, 15).

The full ZMTAU collection was used to study body weight reduction, assumed to relate to size.

We compared data from 333 wild wolves (124 male, 209 female) and 26 wolves born in the institute (17 male, 9 female).

We excluded animals that weighed <16 kg (possibly immature).

Ultimately, data from 359 specimens were available.

SECTION

Carnassial size reduction

PARAGRAPH

We did a thorough literature review on all possible sources that we could retrieve, and that reported on M1 and P4 mesio-distal diameter (Tables 8, 9).

We compared Pleistocene specimens with more recent ones, and compared wolves with dogs.

SECTION

Micro-anatomical tooth differences

PARAGRAPH

To evaluate the importance of the protocone in distinguishing dogs from wolves, we searched the literature for pictures or teeth in Pleistocene wolves.

PARAGRAPH

We also examined the protocone anatomy of 15 skulls of NMBE wolves (Tables 2, 15),

SECTION

Shorter and wider snouts

PARAGRAPH

We elected to address problems such as small specimen numbers and possibly artificial statistical outcomes.

Also, exact measurement procedures differ among studies, making direct comparisons among studies difficult.

We searched the literature for all available data on snout length and width.

We then developed two conversion formulae to transform TL (total length) and BL (basal length) into condobasilar length (CbL) (the latter used most often in literature) (Table 7).

We compiled raw data from four previous studies with our own measurements (n = 106) (Table 11) and performed two linear regression analyses (Fig. 9).

In our study (n = 40), we measured TL, CbL, and BL, in the same 40 specimens (Table 11).

The conversion formulae are: CbL ∗ 1.06 = TL and CbL ∗ 0.94 = BL.

These formulae show that TL is on average 6% greater than CbL, while BL is on average 6% lower than CbL.

These conversion formulae did not differ among the groups in the analyses (TL: F3,83 = 0.36, p = 0.79; BL: F3,83 = 2.73, p = 0.08); showing that they can be applied to both dogs and wolves.

These formulae were further used in snout width and length ratio calculations (See below) (Fig. 7).

SECTION

Sorter snouts

PARAGRAPH

We enlarged the existing database by first measuring snout length ratios of Swiss Neolithic dogs (n = 34) (Tables 4, 12, 15) and then by calculating snout length ratios based on reported individual lengths (Aaris-Sørensen, 1977; Arensburg, 2004; Germonpré et al., 2009; Germonpré et al., 2012; Germonpré et al., 2017; Hescheler and Rüeger, 1942; Lüpz, 1974; Ovodov et al., 2011), or on reported means with numbers weighted (Germonpré et al., 2012; Morey, 1992).

If the appropriate skull length (CbL) was not mentioned in a prior report, we calculated it using the appropriate conversion formula (e.g., as done for Lüpz, 1974).

This resulted in 472 additional specimens of modern and archaeological dogs and wolves (for details see Table 12).

SECTION

Wider snouts

PARAGRAPH

In the literature few studies report directly on GPB/CbL ratio (vdd 34/2).

Ovodov et al. (2011) report directly on one case and Sablin and Khlopachev (2002) report on two.

PARAGRAPH

We measured the snout width index in Swiss Neolithic dogs, using the GPB/CbL ratio (vdd 34/2) (n = 34) (Tables 4, 13) and also calculated the same ratio from data available in the literature, from articles in which this index was not calculated in the original article although the needed measure were reported (for details see Table 13).

PARAGRAPH

Additionally if TL of BL were reported instead of CbL, we recalculated these to CbL using the conversion formulae we developed.

PARAGRAPH

Most authors have reported on individual specimens (Aaris-Sørensen, 1977; Germonpré et al., 2009; Germonpré et al., 2012; Germonpré et al., 2017; Hescheler and Rüeger, 1942; Morey, 1992; Ovodov et al., 2011), and some on mean values (Germonpré et al., 2009); in the latter cases, calculations were done on means with the number of measurements weighted.

PARAGRAPH

The calculation data from the literature allowed us to add 309 specimens to measure this index being Holocene canids (138 dogs, 171 wolves), Pleistocene canids (9 wolves or unassigned specimens, 10 proposed proto-dogs) and 34 Swiss Neolithic group database (Table 13).

SECTION

Higher skull and snout index

PARAGRAPH

We measured modern dogs of 19 breeds (n = 68); modern wolves of five subspecies (n = 69); Neolithic dogs (n = 34); and one Mesolithic dog (Bedburg) (Tables 14, 15), comparing these to the DD1 and DD2 results in Neolithic dogs (n = 2) and wolves (n = 24) from the original report.

SECTION

The enigma of proposed large Paleolithic dogs

PARAGRAPH

To study these ten specimens, we analyzed each individual specimen separately or as a group if they had been published as such.

We followed the historical publication date to reveal which reasoning had been used, and if measures could be valued as correct for assigning the specimen to the dog group.

If necessary, we repeated ratio calculations and compared these to a larger groups that were part of our database.

If necessary, we used the conversion formulae we developed to enlarge the dataset to enable us to compare measures and ratios.

SECTION

Results

SECTION

Mandible length

PARAGRAPH

The nine length measurements were distributed normally in our group (W values Shapiro-Wilks test > 0.96).

To identify clusters of individuals that differed in size or form in this group, we used hierarchical clustering based on pairwise Euclidian distances between specimens using all measurements, and on the minimum variance method by Ward (using the package PVClust in R).

We used a bootstrap procedure to identify clusters that differed significantly.

The cluster analysis defined two clearly separated groups (n = 31 and n = 40) (Fig. 1).

The t-tests of the average for each of the nine traits revealed that in all cases the differences were highly significant.

The proportional difference in size between the two German shepherd clusters was even larger than the differences observed in the Předmostí specimens (6.1% versus 7.7%) (Table 1) (Fig. 1)

SECTION

Contact points of the skull on a horizontal plane

PARAGRAPH

Dog skulls were stable on P4 in 50% of specimens and on canines in 39% (11% inconclusive).

Wolf skulls were stable on P4 or C in 47% and 40% of specimens, respectively (13% inconclusive) (Fig. 2).

SECTION

Caudal shifting of the border of the hard palate

PARAGRAPH

In modern wolves, the border is rostral from the M2 line in 69% (n = 27) and caudal 8% (n = 3) of the cases, while in Neolithic dogs, it is rostral in 81% (n = 42) and caudal in 2% (n = 1) of the cases.

These two did not differ significantly (χ21 = 0.80, p = 0.37).

PARAGRAPH

In modern dogs, the border is rostral in 38% (n = 38) and caudal in 58% (n = 58) of the cases, which differs from both modern wolves (χ21 = 21.3, p < 0.0001) and Neolithic dogs (χ21 = 38.7, p < 0.0001).

PARAGRAPH

In German shepherds, the border is rostral in 8% (n = 6) and caudal in 61% (n = 46) of the cases, which statistically differs from wolves (χ21 = 45.5, p < 0.0001), Neolithic dogs (χ21 = 66.5, p < 0.0001) and modern dogs (χ21 = 11.4, p = 0.0007).

Neolithic dogs thus appear more like wolves, while German shepherds have only a small percentage of wolf-like intra-oral anatomy (Fig. 3).

SECTION

Skull size reduction as a parameter for stature reduction

PARAGRAPH

Skull length difference (TL) between (modern) wild and zoo wolves is 17% (mean wild: 247 mm, zoo: 212 mm) (Table 7).

PARAGRAPH

The mean weight of wild (n = 124) and institute (n = 17) male wolves was, respectively, 25.2 kg and 22.3 kg (t = 2.53, d.f. = 21, p = 0.02).

Female wild (n = 209) and institute (n = 9) wolves weighed, respectively, mean 23.5 kg and 19.5 kg (t = 2.78, d.f. = 8, p = 0.02).

Wild wolves weighed significantly (21%) more (Fig. 9).

It could be argued that this difference is caused by loss of activity correlated muscle mass in institute animals.

Therefore, TL was compared in the same collection in a restricted number of specimens (n = 24).

These were intact skulls from wolves born in the institute (n = 11) and a group of randomly-chosen skulls from the wild collection (n = 13).

In wild and institute wolves, TL in males equaled 22.5 cm and 22.1 cm respectively (t = 0.76, d.f. = 11 p = 0.47); in females: 22.4 cm and 20.7 cm (t = 4.51, d.f. = 9, p = 0.001) and overall 22.5 cm and 21.4 cm (t = 3.10, d.f. = 22, p = 0.005), corresponding with a statistically significant 5% longer skull in wild wolves (Fig. 4).

PARAGRAPH

Together, the TL reduction of 17% (literature) and 5% (this study); and 21% lower body weight (this study) and 25% (literature), show that wolves born and kept in an anthropogenic environment are smaller than their wild congeners from the very beginning.

SECTION

Carnassial size reduction

SECTION

M1

PARAGRAPH

Pleistocene wolf M1 mesio-distal diameter (22.5–32.5 mm) overlaps partly with those of Magdalenian dogs (20.2–26.9 mm), and overlaps nearly completely with proposed Paleolithic dogs (24–32.7 mm) (Table 9).

More recent Holocene dogs (17.5–25.5 mm) separate from modern wolves (24.2–32.6 mm) with minimal overlap (24.2–25.2 mm).

Taken together, archaeological dogs have M1: 17.0–26.9 mm and fossil wolves or canids 22.5–32.7 mm.

Thus, there is considerable overlap.

SECTION

P4

PARAGRAPH

P4 reduction (Table 8) is less conservative, with mesio-distal diameters in Magdalenian dogs between 16 and 21.8 mm, while Pleistocene wolves have mesio-distal diameter above 23.3 mm.

If the proposed Paleolithic dogs (column D, Table 8) are added to Pleistocene wolves and unassigned specimens (columns F and G, Table 8), the minimal mesio-distal diameter is 22.5 mm; still excluding overlap.

Taken together, archaeological dogs have a P4 mesio-distal diameter: 14–21.8 mm and fossil wolves or canids a P4 mesio-distal diameter: 22.5–29.2 mm.

There is no overlap.

SECTION

Micro-anatomical tooth differences

PARAGRAPH

Literature review showed among Pleistocene wolves, a prominent protocone can be present, such as in several MIS 3 wolves that include the Avetara wolves from Italy (Bertè and Pandolfi, 2014; Fig. 4b, 370), the Mora Cavorso specimen from Italy (Salari et al., 2017; Figs. 2B and 3B), and the French Ramaux specimen (Boudadi-Maligne, 2010; Fig. 146, 254).

The feature occurs also in even more ancient canids such as Canis falconeri (Palmqvist et al., 1999; Fig. 2B, 81); Canis arnensis (Boudadi-Maligne, 2010, Fig. 4, 20), Canis etruscus (Boudadi-Maligne, 2010, Fig. 5, 22); Canis seneziensis (Boudadi-Maligne, 2010, Fig. 6, 25); Canis apolloniensis (Boudadi-Maligne, 2010; Fig. 7, 26); and Canis mosbachensis (Boudadi-Maligne, 2010; Fig. 74D, 125).

PARAGRAPH

In the group of modern wolves we examined, all had a prominent protocone (Fig. 5).

SECTION

Shorter and wider snouts

SECTION

Shorter snouts

PARAGRAPH

Modern wolves (0.562) and dogs (0.543) have a snout length index greater than their respective archaeological/fossil counterparts (wolves 0.505; dogs 0.497), indicating longer snouts although the difference is not statistically significant between modern wolves and modern dogs (weighted t-test: t = 0.85, d.f. = 4, p = 0.5) or between fossil wolves and archaeological dogs (weighted t-test: t = 0.25, d.f. = 2, p = 0.8) (Table 12).

SECTION

Wider snouts

PARAGRAPH

We found no statistical difference between snout width indices of Pleistocene wolves versus proposed proto-dogs (weighted t-test: t = 2.04, d.f. = 17, p = 0.06).

PARAGRAPH

The mean snout width index in Holocene dogs (0.366) and wolves (0.341) was significantly different (weighted t-test: t = 3.16, d.f. = 3, p = 0.04) (Table 13).

These observations confirm a wider snout ratio in dogs versus wolves.

PARAGRAPH

In dogs, there was no significant difference between modern and archaeological-Holocene specimens (weighted t-test: t = 2.01, d.f. = 2, p = 0.18).

PARAGRAPH

In Holocene wolves, measurements reveal a significantly narrower snout in modern wolves, compared to sub-fossil samples (weighted t-test: t = 4.50, d.f. = 2, p = 0.02) and between modern wolves and an enlarged group of sub-fossil samples (with added large Pleistocene canids n = 19; Table 13) (weighted t-test: t = 3.12, d.f. = 8, p = 0.01) (Table 13).

Modern wolves thus have significantly narrower (and longer) snouts than their fossil cousins.

SECTION

A higher snout and skull ratio

PARAGRAPH

DD1 (Table 14) has a range of 0.14–0.18 in archaeological specimens (wolves 0.16–0.18; dogs 0.14–0.18) and 0.13–0.25 in modern specimens (wolves 0.16–0.18; dogs 0.13–0.25).

PARAGRAPH

DD2 (Table 14) has a range of 0.32–0.41 in archaeological specimens (wolves 0.32–0.36; dogs 0.34–0.41) and 0.29–0.47 in modern specimens (wolves 0.29–0.37; dogs 0.29–0.47).

PARAGRAPH

Modern specimens thus have wider ranges than archaeological specimens, which could be explained by the larger modern database and the expanded geographical ranges of modern wolves and dogs that were examined.

PARAGRAPH

There are statistical differences between all dogs and all wolves for DD1 (t196 = 5.47, p < 0.0001) and DD2 (t196 = 9.00, p < 0.0001), and also between modern dogs and modern wolves for DD1 (t137 = 5.98, p < 0.0001) and DD2 (t137 = 6.92, p < 0.0001).

There are, however, only statistical differences between Neolithic dogs and modern wolves for DD2 (t57 = 7.64, p < 0.0001) and not DD1 (t57 = 0.87, p = 0.39) (See also Table 14) (Fig. 6).

SECTION

The enigma of proposed large Paleolithic dogs

PARAGRAPH

All reported dogs (Table 6) belonging to this category are discussed in chronological order.

SECTION

Mezin

PARAGRAPH

Mezin (5490) was published in Russian in 1980–1990 (Pidoplichko, 1998; Pidoplichko et al., 2001; Soffer, 1985).

SECTION

Mezhirich

PARAGRAPH

Mezhirich (4493-24/NMNHU-P 56-4492-84) was first published by Germonpré et al. (2009).

Both are large specimens and belong to excavations of a mammoth hunting camp in Ukraine.

PARAGRAPH

Both were classified as dogs, mainly based on: tooth crowding, shorter and wider snouts, shorter skulls (Mezin 12% shorter than other local wolf skulls), and shorter carnassials,

PARAGRAPH

Tooth crowding cannot be used to separate dogs from wolves (Ameen et al., 2017).

Snout length cannot be used to separate wolves from dogs (this article).

The snout width index of these skulls is mean 0.37, and not significantly different (t = 2.04, d.f. = 17, p = 0.06) from Pleistocene wolves (mean 0.36) (Table 13); P4 mesio-distal diameter (22.5 resp.

22.6 mm) are the shortest mesio-distal diameters of the Pleistocene canid group (22.5–29.2) (Table 8); and Mezins' skull length (257 mm) lies within the normal variation of Pleistocene wolves (195–279 mm) (Table 7).

Additionally, is should be noted that Mezin 5490 is an immature animal (about 8 months old) (Soffer, 1985), thus with immature skull measures.

The skull length is well within the normal distribution range of Dolgov and Rossclimo (1964) (Table 5), and well above that from first generation wolves born in a zoo out of wild parents (Wolfgram, 1894).

SECTION

Eliseevichi (2 specimens)

PARAGRAPH

These two specimens were published in 2002 (Sablin and Khlopachev, 2002).

They were assigned as dogs based on a short and wide snout (CbL (vdd 34/2) = 0.38 versus 0.34 in recent wolves, 0.

36 in Huskies, 0.38 in Great Danes).

We have shown that the shorter snout is not a valid criterion to assign a canid to the dog or wolf group.

The OA is in the middle of the wolf group (28°–52°).

Crowding cannot be used to assign a specimen to the dog group.

The reported snout width of 0.39 (Germonpré et al., 2009) is not statistically different from Pleistocene wolves and unassigned specimens (0.36) (t = 1.83, d.f. = 3, p = 0.16; Table 13).

Finally, these two specimens were huge canids (CbL 240, 256 mm), not showing the expected size reduction phenomenon.

SECTION

Goyet

PARAGRAPH

This specimen was defined as a dog mainly based on shorter skull and wider and shorter snout.

It was compared to other canids with principal component and discriminant function analysis, and placed in the group with other canids previously defined as dogs; Eliseevichi, Mezin and Mezhirich (Germonpré et al., 2009).

Skull length was 227 mm, in middle of the Pleistocene wolf group (195–279 mm) (Table 7); snout length cannot be used to discern dogs from wolves and snout width (O.36) was not different statistically from Pleistocene wolves.

Allocating this specimen to the typology group containing Eliseevichi Mezin and Mezhirich does confirm this specimen as a wolf, because the comparative specimens were rejected as dogs by our arguments above.

SECTION

Razboinichya

PARAGRAPH

This specimen (33 kya) (Ovodov et al., 2011) was classified as a Paleolithic dog based on a caudally oriented coronoid process, a shorter and wider snout, P4 length less than M1 + M2, and shorter skull length (TL 211 mm).

PARAGRAPH

Coronoid process form (Janssens et al., 2016a), P4 length: M1 + M2 mesio-distal diameter versus P4 (Gaudry and Boule, 1892; Wolfgram, 1894), and shorter snout are, as reported, unreliable classification criteria.

PARAGRAPH

Snout width index is 0.36 (Table 13), not significantly different from Pleistocene wolves 0.355 (weighed t-test: t = 2.04, d.f. = 17, p = 0.06).

PARAGRAPH

Skull length is short (TL 211 mm), but longer than Late Pleistocene Yukon wolves (Olsen, 1985).

PARAGRAPH

Based on all criteria, it is impossible to assign this skull to the dog group, a decision corroborated by genetic analysis (Thalmann et al., 2013).

This specimen was defined genetically a wolf.

Thus, the specimen is well within the TL spread of Pleistocene wolves (195–279 mm) (Table 7).

SECTION

Three Předmostí specimens

PARAGRAPH

Three Předmostí specimens (“Předmostí 1069” (also numbered 1063 or 3), “Předmostí 1060” and “Předmostí–” - 27.5 kya) (Germonpré et al., 2012) were added to the Pleistocene dog group by the same authors that added Goyet (Germonpré et al., 2012), based on identical criteria, and evaluated using the same methods (PCA, DFA and uni-variate analysis).

They are rejected as dogs.

Their skull lengths are respectively 238, 236 and 232 mm, aligning with wolf range.

Their respective snout widths are 0.37, 0.37, and 0.38, not significantly different from Pleistocene wolves.

Their assignment to the typology group containing Eliseevichi, Mezin, Mezhirich, and Rhazboinchya, confirms these specimens as wolves.

SECTION

Hohle Fels

PARAGRAPH

This specimen (40 kya) (Camarós et al., 2016) has been dealt with in detail before, and cannot be accepted as a dog based on protocone anatomy alone.

This characteristic that is not specific for dogs.

SECTION

Ulakhan Sular 1346

PARAGRAPH

Ulakhan Sular 1346 is another specimen assigned to the Pleistocene dog group, based on the same criteria and by the same authors that added Goyet and three Předmostí specimens including PCA en DFA.

PARAGRAPH

Its snout width index is 0.40, not statistically different from Pleistocene wolves.

Skull length (TL) is 206 mm, short but in the range of Pleistocene wolves and longer that Alaskan wolves.

SECTION

All together

PARAGRAPH

Rather than looking at each individual, we looked at the total number (excluding Hohle Fells for which only information on one tooth was available), including also all wolves and unidentified specimens that were published and used in PCA and DFA analysis (Germonpré et al., 2009; Germonpré et al., 2012; Germonpré et al., 2017; Ovodov et al., 2011).

We used cluster analysis, based on Euclidian distances and the minimum variance method by Ward (using the package PVClust in R), adding the Trou Balleux wolf specimen published in 2009 (Germonpré et al., 2009), but not used in later publications by the same authors (Germonpré et al., 2012; Germonpré et al., 2015) to enlarge the wolf group.

The measures we use are the same as used in the reported publications: TL (total skull length, vdd 1); VL (Viscero-cranial length, vdd 8); ALP1-M2 (tooth row length from rostral (mesial) P2 to caudal M2); P4CL (P4 mesio-distal diameter, vdd 18); GWbrc (greatest width of the braincase, vdd 29); GWpal (greatest palatal width, vdd 34); and MWpal (minimal palatal width, vdd 35).

We used a bootstrap procedure to identify clusters that differed significantly.

Our prediction was that if the specimens included both wolves and dogs, two significantly different groups should be identifiable.

Results show no clearly distinct groups (Fig. 7).

On the contrary, we note four statistically different small clusters and a few individual specimens that cannot be assigned to any cluster.

SECTION

Discussion and conclusions

SECTION

Mandible mass

PARAGRAPH

There are few data on mandible width, and those that are available have not demonstrated differences between dogs and wolves.

Data on mandible height are inconclusive or contradictory.

Mandible lengths in the Předmostí specimens (Germonpré et al., 2015) likely do not reflect domestication, but rather a normally varying and relatively homogeneous population.

The length differences found between the two subgroups of German shepherds were 6.3–9.3% (Table 1), being even larger than in the Předmostí canids.

This analysis thus illustrates that the use of cluster analysis followed by significance tests, can lead to incorrect conclusions, and is not recommended to be used in this way.

Although Drake et al. (2017) reported statistical difference between modern wolves and dogs, this was not so for archaeological specimens.

Therefore we conclude that neither mass nor any of the three separate dimensions can be used to discern wolves from dogs.

SECTION

Contact points of the skull on a horizontal plane

PARAGRAPH

Both contact types occur in wolves and dogs in about half of the cases.

Therefore, this criterion does not appear to be useful in separating dogs from wolves.

SECTION

Caudal shifting of the border of the hard palate

PARAGRAPH

This criterion cannot be used to distinguish dogs from wolves because of a high percentage of inconclusive specimens, and because dogs and wolves have mixed morphologies.

Despite their claimed wolf-like appearance in historical (not recent) literature (Aaris-Sørensen, 2004; Studer, 1901; Wolfgram, 1894), German shepherds should be used carefully and not determined as a wolf-like dog.

SECTION

Smaller stature

PARAGRAPH

Based on morphometric conversion formulae to estimate body mass (Clutton-Brock, 1995; Harcourt, 1974; Losey et al., 2015; Losey et al., 2017; Onar et al., 2002; Onar and Belli, 2005; Pionnier-Capitan, 2010; Tchernov and Valla, 1997) the oldest archaeological dogs' size likely was around 15 kg, with a shoulder height of 40–50 cm, roughly 30–50% smaller than wolves, but keeping normal proportions (Chaix, 2000; Losey et al., 2015; Pionnier-Capitan, 2010; Pionnier-Capitan et al., 2011; Vigne, 2005).

Maybe the first generation(s) of domesticated wolves have been larger, but we do not know how long it took to ‘evolve’ to the smaller dog stature.

The oldest reported dogs clearly are smaller than Pleistocene wolves.

PARAGRAPH

Concerning the so-called large stature proto-dogs, if we group all Pleistocene canids reported as wolves, as unassigned specimens, and as proto-dogs, we observe that for TL the earliest dogs have a maximum of 191 mm, while the minimum in Pleistocene canids are 195 mm, in making separation possible (Table 7).

PARAGRAPH

We cannot know if small stature was actively selected for.

It is tempting to believe that certain populations, such as the Neolithic societies in Scandinavia and around the Alps did select for small dogs, as this type of dog persisted for about 1000 years or longer, in a very wide area.

To pertain such a type, for such a long time period, one has to combat selectively heterozygosity of certain phenotypic traits, which, when pressure from human directional selection relaxes, leads rapidly to genotypic and phenotypic variation, and thus to a return to the original type which is quite larger (Futuyame, 2009; 304–355).

It is however impossible to ascertain this theory as also founder effect and bottleneck phenomenon can be responsible for small size.

SECTION

Carnassial size reduction

PARAGRAPH

Mesio-distal P4 diameter in the earliest dogs is maximum at 21.8 mm, and minimally 22.5 mm in Pleistocene canids (wolves, so called proto-dogs, and unassigned specimens together) making separation possible.

Size reduction (Table 8) suggests that P4 could be an identifying signal for early dogs.

M1 Mesio-distal can also be of use be it to a limited degree:

SECTION

Micro-anatomical tooth differences

PARAGRAPH

The mesio-distal diameter of P4 in the Hohle Fels specimen is 32 mm (our measurement) (Camarós et al., 2016; Fig. 10), longer than any of the Pleistocene wolves and presumed to be Paleolithic dogs in our large database (maximum 29.2 mm) (Table 8).

The observations suggest a massive stature of this canid that lacks putative domestication-related size reduction.

Moreover, a prominent protocone is not seen solely in dogs, but also in several Pleistocene and modern wolves.

Thus, one could not conclude that the Hohle Fels specimen was domesticated, based on one criterion only.

PARAGRAPH

There is a clear need for large population studies of several minute anatomical dental landmarks in Pleistocene canids, to facilitate understanding normal variability of dental landmarks.

Boudadi-Maligne (2010, Fig. 67–68. 104) approached this idea in modern wolves.

It might be that these traits are inherited quantitatively (Barton and Keightley, 2002) and behave in a network-like manner (Thompson and Thoday, 1979; 2950), making them unsuitable for consistent diagnostic purposes.

SECTION

Wider and shorter snouts

PARAGRAPH

Our conversion formulae are robust and can be applied with high confidence to recalculate snout width and length indexes into one ratio, thus creating a much larger reference group that represents the normal variability of the total population in a more natural way.

SECTION

Shorter snouts

PARAGRAPH

Our results confirm the need to compare archaeological dogs to Pleistocene/fossil, not modern wolves.

Based on data from >1700 specimens, we conclude that dogs do not have shorter snouts compared to wolves, and shortening of the snout cannot be used as an indicator of domestication.

This confirms results of an earlier important but neglected work (Wayne, 1986).

SECTION

Wider snouts

PARAGRAPH

Based on data from >2000 dog and wolf specimens, we conclude that mean snout width in dogs is statistically significantly wider than in wolves.

However, there is a large overlap in this index between dogs (0.32–0.37) and wolves (0.33–0.40).

Furthermore, within single groups such as in Pleistocene wolves (Table 13), ratios range from 0.33 to 0.40, while in Swiss Neolithic dogs the range is between 0.35 and 0.42 (Table 3).

In our view snout width ratio in an archaeological context will be restricted to the extremes.

To define which extremes are statistically reliable, large groups of archaeological and modern dogs and wolves remain to be measured in a forthcoming project.

At present, we speculate that a ratio above 0.40 probably indicates a dog.

PARAGRAPH

The wider snout is the consequence of a shape change of the mid-face in dogs, with its maximum at the transversal plane of P4, and congruent with enlargement in the rostral and dorso-lateral directions of the orbital, frontal, and rostral zygomatic region (Studer, 1901; Drake, 2011; Rizk, 2012; Schmitt and Wallace, 2012).

These changes lead to a wider OA (Janssens et al., 2016c; Drake et al., 2015) with a dorso-lateralization of the frontal and orbital region (Wolfgram, 1894; Drake, 2011; Rizk, 2012; Schmitt and Wallace, 2012; Janssens et al., 2016c) thus forming a stop (Drake, 2011) (degree of angle change between nasal and frontal bone seen from a lateral view).

These changes are driven by the expression and allelic composition of the Runx2 gene, of which a hyperactive variant enhances dorsal and lateral maxillary bone growth, thus imposing adaptations of surrounding skull bones (Fondon and Garner, 2007).

SECTION

A higher snout and skull ratio

PARAGRAPH

There are almost no skulls available, let alone complete skulls, from older dogs, beyond those that we examined.

Therefore, we cannot know whether the lack of statistical difference for DD1 between archaeological specimens and modern wolves was due to specific form and size of these small Neolithic dogs.

Clearly, there is need for additional research with Pleistocene wolves.

As it is now, DD2, not DD1, can be used as a marker to differentiate among archaeological canid specimens.

The overlap between archaeological dogs and archaeological wolves is minimal (0.34–0.36) and thus is it a useful measurement for this purpose.

Most dogs have a considerably higher skull than wolves.

PARAGRAPH

The higher skull shape that we measured in dogs aligns with other studies (Nehring, 1888; Studer, 1901; Wolfgram, 1894) that report larger OA in dogs, based on a higher and more lateral position of the zygomatic process of the frontal bone (Janssens et al., 2016c).

Additionally, a recent 3D GM study showed that dogs have a more forward-facing orbit, caused by a relative forward shifting of the frontal bones and a more pronounced angle between muzzle and forehead, creating a stop (Drake et al., 2015).

These remarks are consistent with a higher DD2.

SECTION

The enigma of proposed large Paleolithic dogs

PARAGRAPH

Concerns about methodology and conclusions large Paleolithic dogs have been stated (Boudadi-Maligne and Escarguel, 2014; Crockford and Kuzmin, 2012; Morey, 2014; Perri, 2016; Pitulko and Kasparov, 2017).

These concerns are confirmed by our data, showing that none of the large proposed Pleistocene dogs can be assigned to a Paleolithic dog group with confidence.

PARAGRAPH

This conclusion is corroborated by genetic research.

Three of these specimens were tested for mtDNA (Thalmann et al., 2013).

The Goyet and Razboinichya had no mtDNA that closely related to modern, Neolithic, or Magdalenian dogs (Frantz et al., 2016; Pionnier-Capitan, 2010; Thalmann et al., 2013).

The Razboinichya specimen (Ovodov et al., 2011) originally was classified as a dog based on DNA analysis (Dhruzkova et al., 2013), but later was assigned as a wolf (Thalmann et al., 2013).

PARAGRAPH

Additional concerns exist regarding methodology of earlier studies, mainly the original reference group.

The 2009 study by Germonpré et al. accepted the very large Eliseevichi specimens as dogs, adding three much smaller, Western European Mesolithic dogs into the dog reference group.

A problem with such a reference group is divergence among size, time, and geographical origin (large Pleistocene versus small Holocene specimen, Western versus Eastern European origin).

In our view, unknown specimens need to be compared to more rigorously-derived dog populations, while avoiding artificial constructs such as a means of differentiating two subgroups (Perri, 2016).

In our view, allocation of these large canids to a separate group resulted from a small comparative sample.

This is supported by the spread of skull length (TL) among these proposed dogs (all canids 195–279 mm with range 83 mm; Pleistocene dogs 206–256 mm with range 50 mm) (Germonpré et al., 2009; Germonpré et al., 2012; Germonpré et al., 2017).

Thus, the Pleistocene dog range is just 59% of the total range among all Pleistocene canids (Table 6), indicating bias caused by low sample size.

PARAGRAPH

The range of skull length TL among nine presumed Paleolithic dogs is 19% (smallest 206 mm, 81% of the longest 256 mm).

Among the large group of modern Eurasian wolves, the TL range is 29% (smallest 203 mm, longest 288 mm), indicating that the range in the small group of presumed Paleolithic dogs is resulting from low sample size.

General conclusions

PARAGRAPH

We have questioned the validity of traditional morphometrics as classification criteria for canid fossil skulls (Drake et al., 2015).

We observe that traditional morphometric identification of potential early-domesticated dogs largely has been based on low numbers of specimens, as well as unverified diagnostic methods and variables.

An important problem is individual-based identifications, as opposed to population-wide analyses.

PARAGRAPH

A 3D Geometric study that rejected Goyet and Eliseevichi as dogs (Drake et al., 2015) was based on large comparative groups of 91 dogs and 315 wolves, exemplifying the need for large groups in geometric and classical morphometric analysis, to reach robust conclusions.

Though the recovery of only individual or a few specimens is unsurprising, given the early timeframe of potential Paleolithic dogs, we propose the use of much larger canid reference groups to explore whether variation identified as signs of domestication in these specimens actually reflects natural variation that will be seen more easily within larger sample groups.

Caution is required when we compare reported differences between modern wolves and dogs in archaeological contexts.

Insightful examples are the recent report on GM measures on canine mandibles (Drake et al., 2017) and DD1 differences in this study.

PARAGRAPH

We used a large archive of data on ancient and recent dogs and wolves, including published data on proposed Paleolithic domesticated dogs, to investigate whether long-used diagnostics were valid for separating dogs from wolves.

Upon testing the range of morphometric and morphological variables involved in historical and recent studies for identification of domesticated dog specimens, we found that the majority of these were ineffective at distinguishing between domesticated dogs and wolves.

PARAGRAPH

However (Fig. 8) the following characteristics seem to be of absolute value: P′ mesio-distal diameter and skull length (TL).

A few other criteria are of relative value such as Orbital Angle, snout width index, M1 mesio-distal diameters and skull height.

All can help identify potential early Paleolithic dogs.

PARAGRAPH

We acknowledge the limitations of uni-variate statistical tests as used in this study.

The use of multivariate statistical approaches may be more powerful tools in future research, taking advantage of the results of this study.

PARAGRAPH

Future testing of additional large datasets of ancient dog and even more importantly Pleistocene Upper Paleolithic Eurasian wolves, material may further clarify this issue and possibly change the morphological indicators of dog domestication (Perri, 2016).

The issue of which subjects are the most ideal comparatives will be influenced by DNA research that has changed considerably over time, with Middle Eastern (Vonholdt et al., 2010), Eurasian (Thalmann et al., 2013), and Chinese wolves (Wang et al., 2016) proposed as the ancestors of dogs.

It seems reasonable to further examine specimens from all of these locations.

Emphasis should be given to testing large groups of Paleolithic wolves.

The increasingly interdisciplinary combination of archaeology, morphometrics, archaeogenetics (Frantz et al., 2016; Larson and Burger, 2013), and possibly other methods, will be needed to determine conclusively the taxonomic identity of proposed early domesticated dogs.
