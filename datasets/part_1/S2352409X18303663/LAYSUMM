TITLE

An evaluation of classical morphologic and morphometric parameters reported to distinguish wolves and dogs

PARAGRAPH

Visual traits and measurements that support distinguishing dog and wolf skeletal remains have been long-used, but insufficiently researched.

We evaluated 14 of these, including dental abnormalities; mandible shape; orbital angle; hard palate; snout dimensions; and skull dimensions.

We found only a few reliable measures, including skull height, very small or large orbital angle, snout width index, and specific measures of the 1st molar and 4th premolar teeth.

Thus, much earlier research now must be re-considered toward use of combined visual, measured, and genetic traits for accurate archaeological identifications.
