TITLE

Pre–Hispanic ceramics from the Popoloca Central Area, Mexico

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

The term Popoloca became confused because of the connotation given by the Aztecs to many groups that were not Nahuas (Jäcklein, 1991).

At present this denomination (ib.)

applies to indigenous groups of Puebla (Mexico) that linguistically belong to the Otomangue family.

The term “Historical Popoloca” used by Jäcklein refers to the group that existed during the Early Classic period (ca. 200 CE), and he considers (ib.)

to the proto–Otomangues to be the predecessors, who in ca. 7000 BCE began the domestication of several plants.

The Popoloca people lived in the southern and central regions of the State of Puebla, the northern zone of Oaxaca, and perhaps in the eastern zone of Guerrero and the south of Tlaxcala.

However, so far, insufficient studies have been conducted regarding about this ethnic group.

PARAGRAPH

The earliest ethnographic studies in the Metzontla Valley were done at the beginning of the 20th century.

More recently (2003−2011), ethnographic studies on the pottery process at Los Reyes Metzontla town have been carried out by several researchers (de la Vega Doria et al., 2005; Moreno Hernandez and Galvez Rosales, 2006; de la Vega Doria, 2006, 2007, 2010; Hernandez Zarza, 2008).

The information collected allowed the researchers to conclude that the inhabitants of Los Reyes Metzontla are of true Popoloca origin (Moreno Hernandez and Galvez Rosales, 2006).

PARAGRAPH

The Archaeological Project “Popoloca Settlements at Los Reyes Metzontla Valley” began in 2008, under the direction of the archaeologist Socorro de la Vega Doria.

In that first season two test pits were dug at the sites of Coronilla Hill (or Buena Vista Hill) and Metzontla Hill, respectively.

During the First Season of Archaeological Prospecting (2009), the topography of some sectors of the Coronilla Hill site was obtained.

The Second Season of Archaeological Prospecting and the First Excavation in the sites of Iglesia Vieja, San Sebastian and Metzontla Hill were carried out in 2011.

In 2014, the source of red and orange pigment known as Agua la Mina Hill was visited for the first time and material was collected from there.

An important discovery during the Third Season of Archaeological Prospecting (2015) was a cave with rock paintings.

PARAGRAPH

Los Reyes Metzontla Valley is part of the physiographic province of the Sierra Madre del Sur, sub–province of the Sierras Centrales of Oaxaca, within the Mixteca Alta Region and the floristic province of the Tehuacan–Cuicatlan Valley (Sanchez Perez, 2006).

It is formed by igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks (Mendoza Rosales and Silva Romo, 2006), the natural environment is wild, typical of a dry climate, the average temperature is 18.6 °C and the average annual rainfall is 479 to 412.4 mm (de la Vega Doria, 2007).

The geological formation and the geographical location of the area have some unique species of flora growth, particularly with respect to an abundant variety of endemic cacti.

PARAGRAPH

Los Reyes Metzontla town (Municipality of Zapotitlan Salinas, Puebla, Mexico) (Fig. 1) is located in a small valley, surrounded by several hills, emphasizing Coronilla Hill and Metzontla Hill.

The geographic coordinates are 1991327N and 288239E, with an altitude of 1800 to 2600 mamsl (Sanchez Perez, 2006; de la Vega Doria, 2007).

PARAGRAPH

The archaeological sites of Iglesia Vieja San Sebastian, Agua Socoya Hill, Metzontla Hill, and Coronilla Hill (see Fig. 1) were described in the Technical Report on Exploration and Excavation, Second Season, of Archaeological Project Popoloca Settlements at Los Reyes Metzontla Valley (de la Vega Doria, 2014).

PARAGRAPH

The sites of the present study are briefly described in Table 1 and information about raw materials and their sources is included in Table 2.

PARAGRAPH

The purpose of the present investigation was: 1) to provide knowledge on the chemical composition of raw materials (clay, tempers, and pigments) and ceramics (paste and pigments) of the Metzontla Valley and surrounding regions; and 2) based on the chemical, and typological analysis to find similarities and differences between: A) Pre–Hispanic ceramic of Los Reyes Metzontla Valley and the ethnographic pottery of Los Reyes Metzontla town; and B) the ceramic materials of Los Reyes Metzontla Valley and the sites of Cutha, Tehuacan Viejo, and Teteles de Santo Nombre (all of them located within the Popoloca area) and ceramic from of the Huaxtec area so that we may infer the cultural and commercial interrelations between them.

SECTION

Materials and methods

PARAGRAPH

The exemplars of this study came from the following archaeological sites of the Metzontla Valley: Iglesia Vieja San Sebastian (27), Coronilla Hill (14), Agua Socoya Hill (11), and Metzontla Hill (8).

Ceramics of the following neighboring sites were also included: Tehuacan Viejo (7), Cutha (4), and Teteles de Santo Nombre (10).

Two ethnographic samples from Los Reyes Metzontla town and one Pre–Hispanic from Champayan were analyzed as well.

A description of these 84 exemplars is given in Table 3 and some examples are included in Fig. 2A, B, and C.

The outer layers of pottery samples were removed by means of a drill with a tungsten bit and then samples of the pastes were taken (ca. 600 mg).

These outer layers were separated according to their color.

PARAGRAPH

Samples of raw materials are described in Table 3; these include: 9 clays, 2 tempers and 7 pigments; all of which were from the Los Reyes Metzontla Valley.

All these samples were ground with an electric agate mortar and the powders were dried at 353 K for 24 h.

PARAGRAPH

For Nuclear Activation Analyses (NAA), irradiations were performed in the TRIGA MARK III nuclear reactor of the Nuclear Center of Mexico (Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Nucleares) at a thermal neutron flux of 1 × 1013 cm−2 s−1.

Samples of 200 mg of the ceramic pastes and the reference material, irradiated for 2 h, were allowed to decay for 12–14 days, γ–ray spectra being recorded for 1 h. All radioactivity values were corrected by taking into account half–life and decay times.

Nuclear data of the isotopes identified on the γ spectra are given elsewhere (Jimenez-Reyes et al., 2001).

Obsidian rock 278, certified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), was the reference material for the calculation of elemental concentrations.

The elements analyzed were: scandium, iron, cobalt, rubidium, antimony, cesium, lanthanum, cerium, europium, ytterbium, lutetium, hafnium, thorium, and uranium.

PARAGRAPH

Statistical treatments were carried out by taking into consideration the elemental concentration data and using the MURR procedures for the statistical analysis of multivariate archaeometric data written in GAUSS language (Neff, 2008) in order to calculate principal component diagrams.

PARAGRAPH

XRD analyses were carried out at room temperature (Siemens D–5000 diffractometer with graphite mono–chromator, using CuKα radiation).

The diffraction patterns were collected from 2.5 to 70°–2θ with a step size of 0.02°–2θ; in these conditions they were acquired with sufficiently high intensities in order to identify the minerals.

For qualitative identification the JCPDS data files (Bayliss et al., 1986) were used.

X–Ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained for several samples of each group, including the tempers and the raw clay from Pala Hill.

PARAGRAPH

The pigments removed from potteries were also analyzed with a scanning electron microscope Phillips XL–30 at 25 keV.

The elemental concentrations were determined by Energy Dispersion Spectroscopy (EDS) with an EDAX DX–4 spectrometer; in order to obtain the X–ray spectra, a count rate of 2000 to 2500 cps, dead times of 25–30%, and a 150–second acquisition time were used.

SECTION

Results and discussion

SECTION

Raw clay from Pala Hill

PARAGRAPH

Chemical composition obtained by neutron activation analysis is given in Table 4.

Regarding the results obtained for other raw clays of the region (de la Vega et al., 2014), the clay from Pala Hill contains nearly half the iron and cobalt of the clays from the hills surrounding Los Reyes Metzontla town and Agua San Antonio.

PARAGRAPH

The X–ray diffractogram revealed the following minerals: montmorillonite (MgO Al2O3 5SiO2 3H2O), quartz (SiO2), albite (NaAlSi3O8), and, as tertiary phases, calcite, magnesium and aluminum oxide, and elite.

PARAGRAPH

According to Sanchez Perez (2006), the clay sources of Los Reyes Metzontla Valley are sedimentary rocks with a calcareous shale type at their center, which form layers from 5 to 40 cm thick and are interspersed with medium–to–thick carbonate sandstones.

These sources consist of quartz, feldspars, and other lithic materials, in layers of 30 to 60 cm, belonging to the Matzitzi Formation, one of the most extensive of the few Paleozoic units in Mexico (Centeno-Garcia et al., 2009).

The lower zone is different, with metamorphic rocks of the Lower Paleozoic era, belonging to the Acatlan group.

PARAGRAPH

The elements that were identified through EDS analysis were: carbon (16.5 ± 0.1%), oxygen (54.5 ± 0.3%), magnesium (3.5 ± 0.4%), aluminum (11 ± 6%), silicon (10 ± 8%), calcium (3 ± 1%), and iron (2 ± 2%).

These elements correspond to those of the minerals identified by means of the diffractogram.

SECTION

Raw tempers from Tlacotepec and Zaragoza

PARAGRAPH

Table 4 shows the results obtained for these materials.

Both tempers are visually similar and come from the Paleozoic metamorphic rocks of the Acatlan complex (Mendoza Rosales and Silva Romo, 2006), but the concentrations of scandium, iron and cobalt of their sources are different.

Differences are also noted in the concentrations of these same elements with the data previously reported for the Central and North sources (de la Vega et al., 2014).

The concentrations of the other elements analyzed are not so different.

The chemical composition of each temper probably corresponds with the physicochemical degree of decomposition of each source.

PARAGRAPH

For both tempers chlorite–serpentine ((Mg, Al)6 (Si, Al)4 O10 (OH)8) was the primary phase identified by means of XRD.

Talc (Mg3 (OH)2 Si4 O10) was the primary phase for the Tlacotepec temper and it was tertiary for the Zaragoza temper.

Secondary phases were quartz (SiO2), clinochlore ((Mg, Fe2+)5 Al((OH)8/AlSi3O10)), and actinolite (Ca2 (Mg, Fe2+)5 Si8 O22 (OH)2).

In these kinds of materials, talc is usually mixed with chlorite–serpentine, tremolite, and quartz, whose quantities can range from trace to majority.

Actinolite is an intermediate member of the tremolite–ferroactinolite series.

All these minerals are associated with metamorphic rocks.

PARAGRAPH

The results of the EDS of the Tlacotepec source were: carbon (7 ± 1%), oxygen (55 ± 0.2%), magnesium (10 ± 1%), aluminum (3 ± 1%), silicon (11 ± 7%), calcium (5 ± 5%), and iron (6 ± 0.3%).

For the Zaragoza source the results were: carbon (13 ± 6%), oxygen (52 ± 3%), magnesium (6 ± 0.7%), aluminum (3 ± 0.5%), silicon (10 ± 1%), calcium (5 ± 5%), and iron (9.5 ± 0.2%).

The results for both tempers are similar and the elements correspond to the minerals identified by XRD.

SECTION

Raw pigments from Agua La Mina Hill, Tabache Hill and the pigments removed from the archaeological ceramics

PARAGRAPH

The results of the neutron activation analysis of the raw pigments are given in Table 4.

The content of elements with an atomic number >57 (except cerium, whose atomic number is 58) is very small (ca. 3 μg/g and even <0.1 μg/g).

The raw pigments of Agua la Mina Hill, Caves 1 and 2 (samples P128, 129, 130, 131, 132, and 133), are rich in iron and have notorious contents of cerium, antimony and cesium.

The raw pigment of Tabache Hill (P151) is also rich in iron but very poor in other elements; these data are statistically similar to those of the literature (de la Vega et al., 2014).

PARAGRAPH

According to the mineralogical composition obtained by XRD for the raw pigments of Agua la Mina Hill the primary phase is quartz (SiO2).

Hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO(OH)), and calcite (CaCO3) were the secondary phases, whereas the tertiary phases were thuringite ((Fe,Fe,Mg,Al)6(Si,Al)4O10(O,OH)8), dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2), calcium and aluminum oxide (Ca3Al2O6), and natron (Na2CO3 10H2O).

The red color is given by hematite and goethite; whereas the color of calcite ranges between white, yellow, red, and orange.

PARAGRAPH

Sanchez Perez (2006) mentions that the pigment of Tabache Hill is composed mainly of iron oxides and that it agrees with the limestone areas of the Matzitzi formation.

This geological formation consists of sedimentary rocks such as shales, sandstones and conglomerates of quartz, feldspars and fragments of metamorphic rocks (Mendoza Rosales and Silva Romo, 2006).

PARAGRAPH

The results of EDS for the raw pigments from Agua La Mina Hill were the following: carbon (6 ± 1%), oxygen (42 ± 5%), sodium (22 ± 9%), silicon (4 ± 4%), potassium (0.8 ± 0.3%), calcium (3 ± 2), manganese (1.4 ± 0.9%), iron (35 ± 12%), zinc (4 ± 1%), bromine (4 ± 2%), and lead (21 ± 9%).

Except for these last three, the elements analyzed correspond to the minerals identified by XRD.

PARAGRAPH

For the pigment of Tabache Hill, 6.6% of manganese (possibly as pyrolusite, MnO2, which may be dark gray to black) had been reported (de la Vega et al., 2014); the concentration of this element is smaller in the pigments of the Agua La Mina.

This can be visually related to the colors of the pigments; that of Tabache Hill is darker than that of Agua La Mina Hill.

PARAGRAPH

The pigments removed from the archaeological ceramics were classified according to the colors in: a) Monochrome and Polychrome Orange (C61, C67, C75, C79, C105, C111, C120, C147, C148, C69, C89, C106, C110, C119, and C121); b) Monochrome and Polychrome Red (C62, C99, C108, C116, C123, C88, C91, C102, C103, C109, C115, C141, and C149); and c) Polychrome Brown (C68, C107, C118, C125, C144, and C145).

PARAGRAPH

The elemental concentrations were not very different among these groups; therefore, the results are given in a global way.

Then, the values obtained by EDS are as follows: carbon (14 ± 5%), oxygen (46 ± 3%), sodium (<1%), silicon (16 ± 1%), potassium (2.3 ± 0.6%), calcium (2.3 ± 0.6), and iron (10 ± 2%).

Only in the group of Monochrome and Polychrome Red pigments, 5 ± 4% of manganese was also quantified.

Since a portion of the paste was also removed during the removal of the thin layer of the pigment, the mineral elements of the paste were identified in all cases.

However, elements such as calcium, titanium, manganese and iron do indeed correspond to the pigments themselves; and in particular, the iron content of the removed pigments is greater than that of the pastes.

Another notorious difference is the presence of manganese in the group of Monochrome and Polychrome Red pigments (possibly as pyrolusite, MnO2, of bluish gray color and/or MnO(OH) manganite, of black color).

SECTION

The ceramic pastes

PARAGRAPH

Fig. 3 shows the diagram of principal components obtained with the concentrations of 14 elements of the 84 ceramic pastes.

Six groups were identified and 12 samples were different of them.

Table 5 shows the mean values and standard deviations of the elemental concentrations of each group and the data corresponding to the 12 ungrouped samples are presented in Table 6.

PARAGRAPH

The ethnographic samples E150 and E152 are part of Group 5.

This group is notoriously different from the others, with the highest concentrations in scandium, iron and cobalt and the smallest for the other elements.

Differences are less noticeable among the other groups, and they refer mainly to the concentrations of antimony and cesium, which are the highest those of Groups 2 and 4, followed by Groups 1 and 6, and, finally, the Group 3 with the lowest.

PARAGRAPH

The data of the chemical compositions of the ceramic pastes were compared with other ceramics: Popoloca Orange (de la Vega et al., 2014), archaeological Brown and ethnographic from Los Reyes Metzontla town (ib.),

and Thin Orange (Abascal, 1974).

For the analysis of principal components, only the elements that were the same as those reported in the mentioned researches were considered: Sc, Fe, Rb, Sb, La, Ce, Eu, and Th.

The results are found in Fig. 4, where the following is observed: A) Data of the Popoloca Orange ceramic previously reported (de la Vega et al., 2014) are clearly included in Group 1, even if a slight difference in iron content was observed (50 ± 5 mg/g of reported data and 33 ± 7 mg/g of Group 1); B) with respect to the Thin Orange ceramics (Abascal, 1974), AD2 and AD3 are statistically identical to Group 1 in all elements considered, while AD1 differs in Rb, La, Ce and Th; and C) Group 5 (which includes pre–Hispanic samples from Iglesia Vieja San Sebastian, Agua Socoya Hill, Coronilla Hill, and Cutha, as well as ethnographic samples from Los Reyes Metzontla town) does not present differences with respect to pre–Hispanic and ethnographic Brown ceramic, reported before (de la Vega et al., 2014).

PARAGRAPH

With a similar calculation and considering 14 elements, the ceramic pastes were compared with data of the raw clay sources of the Metzontla Valley (de la Vega et al., 2014) and those of Pala Hill (B134).

Statistical similarity was found between the black clay of Pala Hill and Group 6 (n = 10), as shown in Fig. 4.

Such similarity might suggest the absence of temper in the pieces of that group.

PARAGRAPH

Some exemplars of Group 1 (C67, C68, C69, C89, and C102), Group 2 (C103 and C122), Group 3 (C149), Group 4 (C109), Group 5 (C71, C123), and some of those ungrouped (C108, C110, C121, C135) were analyzed by XRD.

SiO2 was the primary phase for all these samples; as quartz or cristobalite (this is particularly for C121 and C149, which were possibly fired at high temperature, causing a transformation of the silica).

Pseudowollastonite Ca3(Si3O9), a high temperature mineral phase of CaSiO3, was identified for samples C122, C149 and C135.

PARAGRAPH

As the secondary phases of Group 1 the feldspars albite (K0.2Na0.8AlSi3O8) and anortite (Ca(Al2Si2O8)) and the mica muscovite (KAl3Si3O10(OH)2) were identified and as the tertiary phases some feldspars, ferric oxide (Fe2O3), and maghemite (Fe1.97O2.96) were identified.

Iron oxides, only identified in this ceramic group, are quite possibly the cause of the orange color of these pastes.

PARAGRAPH

For Group 2 and Group 3, the calcium, sodium and aluminum silicate (Ca0.8Na0.2Al1.8Si2.2O8) was a primary phase; as secondary phase andesine ((Na,Ca)(Si,Al)4O8) and albite were identified; whereas muscovite and calcite were the tertiary phases.

PARAGRAPH

Anorthoclase (secondary phase), muscovite and magnesium calcite (Mg0.03Ca0.97)(CO3) (tertiary phase) were identified in the samples of Group 4.

PARAGRAPH

Group 4, also as the primary phase, contains tremolite (Mg2Si5Al4O18), cordierite (Ca2Mg5Si8O22(OH)2), and talc (Mg3(OH)2Si4O10).

The presence of the latter is due to the temper used for the manufacturing of this ceramic type.

PARAGRAPH

For the ungrouped samples, the minerals were different for each one.

C108 (Red on orange) contains as a secondary phase sanidine ((K,Na)(Si,Al)4O8), potassium and aluminum silicate, calcite and muscovite.

C110 (Polychrome Lacquer Cholula) contains labradorite as a primary phase and C121 (Orange on white) contains this mineral as a secondary phase.

The secondary phases for C135 (Red Zaquil) were calcite and magnesium calcite.

SECTION

Ceramics of Group 1

PARAGRAPH

This was the most numerous group and it is formed by Popoloca Orange ceramic.

Even if this type is not quite as abundant in the sites of the Metzontla Valley, it is present in all the studied sites: Iglesia Vieja San Sebastian (14/27), Coronilla Hill (5/14), Metzontla Hill (4/8), Agua Socoya Hill (3/11), as well as Cutha (2/4), and Tehuacan Viejo (1/7).

PARAGRAPH

C137 (Coarse Mica Thick, Cutha) is included in this group; its type is characteristic of the Late Preclassic (400 BCE–200 CE) for Cutha and Tehuacan Valley and has been related to the ceramic Quachilco Mica from Tehuacan Valley (Castellon Huerta, 2006).

C124 (Orange Mica Thick, Coronilla Hill) is similar to C137 in paste, color, aggregated materials and chemical composition.

This would indicate a probable interrelation between both sites through an open channel of intercommunication between Los Reyes Metzontla and Tehuacan Valley.

Moreover, the pastes of Popoloca Orange ceramics during the Late Preclassic period tended to be as thick as Coarse Mica Thick and Quachilco Mica types are.

The similitude of the chemical compositions of their pastes and the roughness of manufacturing may suggest that the ceramic of the Popoloca Orange of Metzontla Valley also had its origin in the Late Preclassic period.

PARAGRAPH

The Orange types of Iglesia Vieja San Sebastian (for example: C66 Tilapa Black on Orange and C67, Tilapa Orange Polished) are considered among the typical ceramics of this site.

They are uniform in the thickness of their walls, ranging from medium thin (5–6 mm) to thin (4–5 mm), and their surface finishing is uniform, sometimes smoothed, polished and often burnished.

Excluding the thickness of the walls, other characteristics of C66 are similar to those described for the Popoloca Black from San Juan Ixcaquixtla of the Classic period (200–900 CE) (Cook de Leonard, 1957).

It cannot be assured that the types Tilapa Black on Orange and Popoloca Black (from San Juan Ixcaquixtla) were manufactured in the same production center and although differences in the techniques of the manufacturing seem to be different, it is possible to suggest that the Popoloca Orange ceramic was not only produced at San Juan Ixcaquixtla but also in Los Reyes Metzontla Valley and, moreover, that both types were chronologically parallel and would continue to occur until the Late Postclassic period (1200–1521 CE).

Other studies reinforce that the origin of orange ceramics is the southern region of Puebla State (Rattray, 1990; Rattray and Harbottle, 1992).

They concluded that Thin Orange ceramic was manufactured at the Tepexi de Rodríguez region for Teotihuacan, according to the specifications of the people of the great city and profiting the hematite rich clays and schist that occur near the Rio Carnero (ca. 90 km from Los Reyes Metzontla Valley).

PARAGRAPH

C111 (Metzontla Hill) and C112 (Coronilla Hill), both Orange Polished Inciso, are similar in color, surface finishing, and decoration to C139 (Cutha), which is of the type Mica Ñuiñe Brown (Middle Classic period, 400–800 CE) previously described by Castellon Huerta (2006).

Being of Group 1, their pastes are also quite similar.

PARAGRAPH

The exemplars C69, C72, C73, C75, C77, C79, C92, C100, and C105 coincide with the type Cutha Orange Smooth (Late Postclassic period) described by Castellon Huerta (2006).

For the sites of the Metzontla Valley, this ceramic was named San Sebastian Orange Smooth, characteristic of the Postclassic period (900–1521 CE).

The color presents variations similar to those identified for the ceramics of Cutha; for example: orange (C69: 2.5YR 6/6 light red), brown (C77: 7.5YR 5/2 brown), and blackish brown (C92: 7.5YR 4/3 brown).

The surface finishing is generally smoothed and the sound is almost metallic.

The paste is generally of medium–to–fine texture with many small mica sheets.

In particular, some of these samples are of fondo sellado (C69, C77, C79, and C92 from Iglesia Vieja San Sebastian and C100 from Agua Socoya Hill), whose characteristics are similar to the type Coxcatlan Brushed, from the Tehuacan Valley described by MacNeish et al. (1970).

Ceramics of fondo sellado of the region were described by Castellon Huerta and Dumaine Lopez (2000).

C59 (Tehuacan Orange Dishware, characteristic of the Postclassic period) is also similar in color, paste and chemical analysis to the aforementioned types.

PARAGRAPH

Castellon Huerta (2006) categorized Jaguar (Postclassic period) as the type Orange Brown Polychrome from Cutha; the sample C68 corresponds to this type.

Other polychrome exemplars are C89 (Red and Orange on White Polychrome) and C88 (Red and Black on Orange Polychrome).

The association of polychrome ceramics (C68, C88 and C89) in Group 1 probably indicates that during the Postclassic period, the inhabitants of Los Reyes Metzontla Valley were producing polychrome pottery with very particular designs.

MacNeish et al. (1970) relates the Orange Polychrome types with the Island of Sacrifice Polychrome (Venta Salada Phase, Postclassic period).

PARAGRAPH

Another interesting example is the ceramic Black on Cream (C104, Metzontla Hill), whose chemical composition of the paste is perfectly within the group of orange ceramics, although it resembles the type Black on White, characteristic of the Huaxtec.

Espinosa Ruiz (2015) described this type for the period Valles Huaxteco (1200–1500 CE, Sierra Gorda of Queretaro) and observed in the paste abundant white particles from medium–to–very fine sizes.

The paste of C104 differs from Black on White, since iron oxides and small shiny sheets are observed, probably of schist mica.

From this comparison, it can be inferred that the ceramic Black on Cream of Metzontla Hill is most likely of local manufacturing.

Future archaeometric investigations, which include ceramic samples of the Black on White type from the Huaxtec area, will help to resolve this idea more clearly.

SECTION

Ceramics of Group 2

PARAGRAPH

The majority of the ceramics of this group have a gray color and they come from Iglesia Vieja San Sebastian (5/27), Agua Socoya Hill (4/11), Coronilla Hill (2/14), and Tehuacan Viejo (2/7).

PARAGRAPH

The ceramics Gray with Greenish Gray outer layer (C78), Gray with Dark Gray outer layer (C83), and Metallic Gray (C84) are characteristic of the Tehuacan Valley.

The surface finishing of C83 is similar to that of the Riego Gray and C84 is similar to that of the Riego Black, both of dark gray color almost black, very polished and with small horizontal flutings.

These types are located in the Classic period of the Tehuacan Valley (Martinez Vargas and Jarquin Pacheco, 2006).

PARAGRAPH

The sample C70 is of type Gray Thick Smoothed San Sebastian (Postclassic period).

The paste is gray (2.5Y 5/1 gray), with medium–to–thick texture, it presents as aggregated materials quartzite and gray and black lithic materials and it was manufactured under a reducing cooking atmosphere.

The surface finishing is a dark gray (10YR 4/1) outer layer, and it is polished on both sides.

The predominant forms for this type include the convex walls, flat bottom and everted edge, with crenellated supports.

C64 (Tehuacan Gray Paste, fondo sellado, Tehuacan Viejo) is similar to C70.

Both ceramics have the same chemical composition; then they appear to come from the same production center.

The characteristics of the C70 are reminiscent of those described by Castellon Huerta (2006) for ceramics found in Cutha and related to the Coxcatlan Gray of the Tehuacan Valley.

PARAGRAPH

The C93 (Brown, Fine Polished, Agua Socoya Hill) corresponds to the Quachilco Gray type of the Tehuacan Valley according to its characteristics of color and decoration.

This type is chronologically located in the Cultural Phase Late Santa Maria (500–150 BCE) (Merino Carrion and Garcia Cook, 2005).

PARAGRAPH

The type Socoya Red on Cream (C103) is similar to the Red on Cream (Postclassic period) found in Cutha (Castellon Huerta, 2006).

This author also indicated that the Red on Cream type is also found in Cholula and in sites of the Mixteca Alta, and that his specimens possibly came from there.

PARAGRAPH

The Tehuacan Orange Dishware (C60, from Tehuacan Viejo) is characteristic of the Postclassic period.

SECTION

Ceramics of Group 3

PARAGRAPH

The Group 3 only includes samples from the site of Teteles de Santo Nombre (Late Preclassic to Middle Classic periods).

This site is located in the Popoloca Central Area, relatively close to the Tehuacan Valley; however, the ceramics analyzed from Teteles de Santo Nombre are different in the composition of their pastes and decoration of the ceramics coming from the sites of the Metzontla Valley, Tehuacan Viejo, and Cutha.

SECTION

Ceramics of Group 4

PARAGRAPH

The ceramics included in this group come exclusively from the sites of the Metzontla Valley: Iglesia Vieja San Sebastian (C74, Gray Fine Polished and C91, Red on Brown), Coronilla Hill (C116, Orange, reddish outer layer and C118, Polychrome Brown), and Metzontla Hill (C109, Orange Brown Polychrome).

Most of the ceramics in this group have fine–to–medium textured paste and their types and colors are similar to those of Group 1 or Group 2; however, the chemical composition of their pastes is not statistically equal of these groups, as aforementioned.

PARAGRAPH

The type Orange Brown Polychrome (C109) has also been found in Cutha and is located in the Late Postclassic period (Castellon Huerta, 2006).

It seems that this kind of ceramic have several homologous along the region.

The Polychrome Popoloca type, also found in Cutha, coincides with the Orange Brown Polychrome in the texture of the paste, in the colors of the decoration and in the shape, as shallow bowls of protruding walls and edges.

Other examples are the Acatlan Polychrome from Acatlan, the funerary ceramics from Tepexi that is located in the Huichi and Xaqua phases (1300–1400 CE), and Coxcatlan Polychrome from Coxcatlan (Tehuacan Valley).

SECTION

Ceramics of Group 5

PARAGRAPH

This group included the following types: Socoya Orange Brown, Thick Smooth (C96), Metzontla Red on Brown (C99 and C123), Metzontla Brown Thick Smooth (C114), Tilapa Brown Thick Polished (C71) and Tilapa Orange Brown Thick Smooth (C86), all of which are characteristics of the Metzontla Valley.

PARAGRAPH

Metzontla Red on Brown ceramic began in the Tehuacan Valley during the Late Purron Phase (1700 BCE), but the largest presence occurred in the Ajalpan Phase (1500–1100 BCE) and continued up to the Early Santa Maria Phase (900 BCE/850–500) (Merino Carrion and Garcia Cook, 2005).

Several characteristics of the Metzontla Red on Brown type are similar to those of the Ajalpan Fine Red type, which include: the color of the paste (from brown to dark gray), the red hematite bath, the waxy luster and the shapes; one of the most characteristic is the bottle with a slightly divergent high neck.

C99 (Metzontla Red on Brown, Agua Socoya Hill) is part of the edge and neck of a bottle; the chronology of that sample may possibly be the Early Preclassic period (Early Ajalpan Phase, 1500–1100 BCE).

That sample is also similar to the shape of the ceramic found at the site of Temamatla (Zacatenco Phase, 700–400 BCE) (Ramirez et al., 2000).

Another sample of the type Metzontla Red on Brown is C123 (Coronilla Hill), which is a ring based pitcher, due to that shape it must likely corresponds to a ceramic type of the Late Preclassic (400 BCE–200 CE) or Early Classic periods.

PARAGRAPH

Among Coronilla Hill ceramics, a type called Metzontla Brown Thick Smooth was identified (C114), whose shapes and decoration are similar to the White Canoes of the Tehuacan Valley (Early Santa Maria Phase, 900 BCE/850–500).

PARAGRAPH

The type Tilapa Brown Orange Thick Polished (C86) resembles in the aggregate materials, rock and iron oxides to the Socoya Orange Brown, Thick Smooth (C96), both from Iglesia Vieja.

The main difference is the surface finishing.

C86 possibly corresponds to the Terminal Classic–Early Postclassic periods (800–1200 CE); whereas C96 may be later to those periods.

PARAGRAPH

The type Tilapa, Brown Thick Polished (C71), characteristic of Iglesia Vieja San Sebastian, resembles the Ajalpan Fine Plain (Fase Ajalpan Temprano: 1500–1100 BCE), identified in the Tehuacan Valley sites (Merino Carrion and Garcia Cook, 2005).

However, the Tilapa Brown Thick Polished may be later because it is related to the type Tilapa Brown Cream Thick Polished that is abundant in Iglesia Vieja San Sebastian.

This last type and the Brown Coarse Rough (characteristic of Cutha, as C138) are located in the Late Classic–Early Postclassic period (600–1200 CE) (Castellon Huerta, 2006).

SECTION

Ceramics of Group 6

PARAGRAPH

Within this group, some ceramics are of the types Orange, Brown and Dark Gray, whose chemical composition of their pastes is slightly different from Group 1, Group 2, or Group 4 for several elements.

PARAGRAPH

Those of Orange types are: C76 Orange Brown Smooth (Iglesia Vieja San Sebastian) and C106 (Orange with outer layer Orange Polished, Metzontla Hill), C61 (Orange Fine Paste, decorated, Tehuacan Viejo), and C62 (Orange Fine Paste, fluted, Tehuacan Viejo).

These types are characteristic of the Postclassic period.

PARAGRAPH

The Brown types are: C81 (Black and Orange on Brown, Iglesia Vieja San Sebastian), C85 (Brown Fine Polished, Brown outer layer, Iglesia Vieja San Sebastian) C94 (Brown Smooth fluted, Agua Socoya Hill), and C63 (Tehuacan Brown Paste, Tehuacan Viejo).

PARAGRAPH

The type of C136 from Cutha is Cholula Inciso (Late Classic–Early Postclassic periods) (Castellon Huerta, 2006).

Finally, even if the majority of samples from Teteles de Santo Nombre form the Group 3, one sample of this site, was statistically included in Group 6 (C146, Matt Tepazolco).

SECTION

Ungrouped ceramics

PARAGRAPH

These 12 ceramic samples came from: the four sites of the Metzontla Valley, Tehuacan Viejo, Teteles de Santo Nombre, and Champayan Las Mesas.

The pastes of each sample are chemically different from the others, although some similarities can be found by their appearance.

PARAGRAPH

C95 (Vista Orange Mica Thick, Agua Socoya Hill) has an appearance similar to both C124 (Orange Mica Thick) and C137 (Coarse Mica Thick) from Group 1.

However, the paste of C95 contains higher concentrations of rare earth elements and thorium, i.e., of sandy material.

PARAGRAPH

C121 (Orange on White, Coronilla Hill) is similar in surface finishing and decoration to C144 (Tlaxixtle, Teteles de Santo Nombre) of Group 3, but the chemical composition of their pastes is different.

Three samples from Teteles de Santo Nombre were different for the groups: C140 (Teteles al Pastillaje), C142 (Rough Xalli) and C148 (Pintaxochitl).

PARAGRAPH

C82 (Orange with Blackish Brown outer layer) and C108 (Red on Orange) are different from Group 4, although similar types to them are included in that group; differences are given by the sandy material contents.

PARAGRAPH

C96 (Socoya Brownish Orange Thick Smooth, Agua Socoya Hill) and C117 (Brown Orange Thick Smooth, Coronilla Hill) are of similar types.

The first one was included in Group 5, whereas the composition of the C117 paste is different so it was ungrouped.

The paste of C115 (Red and Cream on Brown, Coronilla Hill) is brown as well, with small shiny sheets as of schist; however, this exemplar is different of Group 5.

PARAGRAPH

Among the monochrome ceramics of the Tehuacan Valley, a diagnostic type is the called Dishware called Soapy, which, although considered domestic was also used for trade.

In terms of color and surface finishing, it resembles the ceramics currently produced in the community of Los Reyes Metzontla (Castillo Tejero, 2006).

The chemical composition of the exemplar of Tehuacan Soapy (C65, Tehuacan Viejo) is different among the groups.

PARAGRAPH

The type of C110 is Cholula Polychrome Matt.

Firm and Lacquered Polychrome ceramics from Cholula were analyzed (Abascal, 1974) and the groups formed in that research were quite compact, with very similar compositions, suggesting a common origin.

According these data, the region of Acatlan, Puebla was considered as the place of origin of the Cholula Polychrome ceramic, to which Castellon Huerta (2006) located at the Late Postclassic period.

The paste of C110 has lower concentrations for most of the elements than the previously analyzed ceramic of Cholula Polychrome (Abascal, 1974).

PARAGRAPH

The ceramic Zaquil Red (C135) was also different among the groups.

This exemplar corresponds to the cultural phase Zaquil IV (650–900 CE) and comes from Champayan “Las Mesas”, Veracruz, where the Huaxtec culture flourished.

This site is located >700 km from Metzontla Valley, and a major difference with the ceramics of this region was found.

PARAGRAPH

Not all the ungrouped samples are foreign, as it is clear for the Zaquil Red.

Some of them have regional typologies in common but are different of groups because of their content of sandy materials, which can be due to a specific preparation of the craftsmen.

Regarding the ceramics from Teteles de Santo Nombre, it is possible that, at this site, some pastes were prepared according to a specific type.

Another consideration is the possibility of imitation of ceramic types, such as the Tehuacan Soapy and the Cholula Polychrome, which are typical of other sites.

SECTION

Some stratigraphic considerations

PARAGRAPH

The analyzed ceramic samples (Table 3) coming from the sites Agua Socoya Hill, Metzontla Hill, and Coronilla Hill were recovered by surface exploration.

The exemplars of Agua Socoya Hill correspond to the Preclassic period (1500 BCE–200 CE) and most of Metzontla Hill and Coronilla Hill correspond to the Epiclassic period (650–900 BCE).

At these sites, very few exemplars of Thin Orange ceramic (diagnostic material of the Classic period, 200–650 CE) and some types of the Late Postclassic period (1200–1521 CE) were identified as well.

PARAGRAPH

Excepting C92, all the analyzed samples from Iglesia Vieja San Sabastian were recovered by excavation.

The majority of the 47 strata were of horizontal contact, and those of vertical contact did not exceed ca. 33 cm from the surface.

These excavations were done inside and outside of rooms, where collapse of adobe structures and other materials were found.

Regarding these analyzed samples, the stratigraphic relationships are as follows:

PARAGRAPH

Grill 1.

The samples C66 to C80 were recovered from the Surface Stratum and associated with ceramic of the Late Azteca III type, which is diagnostic of the Late Postclassic period (1400–1521 CE).

Ten of these samples were included in G1 (Orange Popoloca).

It is remarkable the sample C71 (Tilapa, Brown Thick Polished) is included in G5 (archaeological Brown Popoloca).

This ceramic type was not only identified at the Surface Stratum of this Grill (consequently associated with diagnostic material of the Late Azteca III type), but in the Stratum 1 of same Grill 1 and in several strata of Grill 2.

PARAGRAPH

Grill 2, Surface Stratum.

Two of the analyzed samples came from this stratum: C81 (Black and Orange on Brown, G6) and C87 (Gray Smooth, G1).

The first ceramic type was found in low proportion at Iglesia Vieja San Sebastian.

PARAGRAPH

Grill 2, Stratum 1.

Only one sample was analyzed: C86 (Tilapa, Orange Brown Thick Polished).

This type is among the most representatives of those identified from the strata of the Grills 1 and 2 and Surface.

Both Tilapa types, Orange Brown Thick Polished and Brown Thick Polished (as C71), form part of G5 (archaeological Brown Popoloca and ethnographic ceramics of Los Reyes Metzontla Valley).

PARAGRAPH

Grill 2, Stratum 1A.

C85 (Brown Fine Polished) was recovered in this Stratum and is similar to C136 (Cholula Inciso, from Cutha, Late Classic to the Early Postclassic periods, 600–1200 CE) in color and surface finishing.

Both form part of G6; therefore, their chemical and mineralogical compositions are virtually the same.

The Brown Fine Polished type was identified as well in the Stratum 19 of Grill 2.

It was found in low proportion at the site and stratigraphically associated to the aforementioned Tilapa, Orange Brown Thick Polished.

PARAGRAPH

Grill 2, Stratum 5.

This stratum produced samples C82 (Orange, Blackish Brown outer layer), C83 (Gray, Dark Gray outer layer, G2) and C84 (Metallic Gray, G2).

The first of these types was also identified in Stratum 1 of this Grill; the paste is orange, like the ceramics of G1, but its chemical composition is different and the sample C82 remained ungrouped.

PARAGRAPH

The type Gray, Dark Gray outer layer was identified as well in the Surface Stratum and in the Strata 1A, 6, and 35.

The Metallic Gray type was also found in the Strata 5 and 35.

These Gray types were more abundant in excavation than in surface; the predominant type in the surface strata was Gray, Thick, and Smoothed San Sebastian, such as C70, of the same G2.

PARAGRAPH

Other ceramics associated with the Stratum 5 were the previously mentioned Tilapa, Orange Brown Thick Polished and Tilapa, Brown Thick Polished.

Due to similar characteristics between the ceramics from the Tehuacan Valley and Cutha, it has been initially supposed that some ceramic types of Gray color corresponded to the Classic period.

The Gray-type samples of the present research were associated with ceramics of the Postclassic period; therefore, it quite possible that these samples correspond to this last period.

PARAGRAPH

Grill 2, Stratum 35.

Samples C89 (Polychrome Red and Orange on White, G1) and C90 (Brownish Gray Fine Smooth, G2) came from this stratum.

Both types were found in low proportion at the site and associated with Metallic Gray, Dark Gray outer layer, and Tilapa, Brown Orange Thick Polished.

PARAGRAPH

Grill 2, Stratum 16.

The only the sample from this stratum is C88 (Polychrome Red and Black on Orange of G1, Popoloca Orange).

PARAGRAPH

Grill 2, Stratum 47.

The sample C91 (Red on Brown of G4) was recovered in this stratum.

The ceramic types associated were both Tilapa, Brown Thick Polished and Orange Brown Thick Polished.

PARAGRAPH

The ceramic of Agua Socoya Hill correspond to the Preclassic period (1500 BCE–200 CE) and most of Metzontla Hill and Coronilla Hill artifacts correspond to the Epiclassic period (650–900 BCE).

Considering the stratigraphy and ceramic typology of the samples from Iglesia Vieja San Sebastian, the corresponding period may be the Late Postclassic (600–1521 CE).

SECTION

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

According to the typology, ceramics of the Groups 1, 2, and 5, and the ungrouped samples cover an extensive chronology for the sites of Metzontla Valley to the Early Preclassic–Late Postclassic periods.

The exemplars of Group 6 correspond to the Late Classic–Late Postclassic periods, and those of Group 4 are later (Middle–Late Postclassic period).

Finally, those of Group 3 (Teteles de Santo Nombre) correspond to the Late Preclassic–Midlle Classic periods.

PARAGRAPH

The ceramics of Group 1 are considered to be of the Orange Popoloca type; their pastes are statistically identical, in the elements considered, to exemplars of Thin Orange ceramics.

PARAGRAPH

The results obtained with the ceramic types from the sites of the Metzontla Valley and Cutha maintain the proposal of a techno–craftsmanship that prevails to this day, particularly for the Brown ceramics, although the types are different and are located in different periods.

The type Brown Coarse Rough from Cutha has the same chemical composition of the archaeological and ethnographic Brown ceramics of the Metzontla Valley.

According to the correlation between the ceramic materials present in the sites of Metzontla and Tehuacan Valleys and Cutha, it is possible that the ceramics manufactured to date at Los Reyes Metzontla have their origin in the Middle Preclassic.

PARAGRAPH

Homologous ceramic types were found in the sites of Iglesia Vieja San Sebastian (Tilapa Brown Thick Polished, C71) and Cutha (Brown Coarse Rough, C138), both types with the same chemical composition of their pastes (Group 4).

PARAGRAPH

The ceramic types of Agua Socoya Hill correspond to the Preclassic period (1500 BCE–200 CE) and most of Metzontla Hill and Coronilla Hill to the Epiclassic period (650–900 BCE).

Considering the stratigraphy and ceramic typology of the samples from Iglesia Vieja San Sebastian the corresponding period may be the Late Postclassic (600–1521 CE).

PARAGRAPH

Most of the samples of Teteles de Santo Nombre formed Group 3; one was statistically similar to Group 6, and three were ungrouped.

It is possible that great commercial or cultural relationships did not exist between that site and those of the Metzontla Valley.

PARAGRAPH

Except for Group 3 and the only one from Champayan, all the groups were composed of recovered samples from practically all the studied sites of Metzontla Valley.

Local pottery was not always manufactured with raw materials from the same sources (although of the region) nor was the proportions always the same.

Most ceramic types are typically local and some others seem to be a copy of the pottery from nearby sites or from more distant places, like the Mexica types of Basin of Mexico or those from the Huaxtec.
