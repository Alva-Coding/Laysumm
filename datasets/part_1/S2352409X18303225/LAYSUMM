TITLE

Pre–Hispanic ceramics from the Popoloca Central Area, Mexico

PARAGRAPH

Pre–Hispanic ceramics from the Metzontla Valley, from the vicinity, and beyond, as well as raw materials were studied.

NAA, EDS and XRD were applied.

Six ceramic groups were identified: one of them includes pre–Hispanic Popoloca Orange ceramic and one other includes pre–Hispanic Brown and present–day Los Reyes Metzontla ceramic.

Apparently raw materials have been the same for a long period of time and Popoloca Orange ceramic is no longer manufactured in the region.

Similarities and differences were found among the ceramics of the Metzontla Valley and those of other sites of the Popoloca area and beyond.
