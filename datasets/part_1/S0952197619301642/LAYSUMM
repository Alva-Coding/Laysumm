TITLE

Identification of nonlinear systems using adaptive variable-order fractional neural networks (Case study: A wind turbine with practical results)

PARAGRAPH

Neural networks have shown promising capabilities in dealing with nonlinear systems.

Combined with a dynamic part, they can learn and identify complicated systems.

On the other hand, fractional order differentiation has provided more degrees of freedom and therefore more accuracy for exploring the behaviour of dynamical systems.

This paper introduces a fractional order neural network capable of identifying complicated systems.

Input-output representational capacity is shown, learning rules for the parameters are derived and its performance on the real data of a 2.5MW wind turbine is examined.

The results are amazing and the method can be used for other industrial systems.
