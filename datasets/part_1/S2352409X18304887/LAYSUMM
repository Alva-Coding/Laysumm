TITLE

Comprehensive magnetic surveys of kilns for bell and tile fabrication in Castile (Spain)

PARAGRAPH

Chronological information in archaeological rescue excavations is usually limited and the eventual absence of organic remains limits the application of radiocarbon.

However, determining the last use of archaeological combustion structures can be done through archaeomagnetism.

Here is presented an archaeomagnetic study carried out on kilns for bell and tile fabrication in Spain.

Two full vector archaeomagnetic datings were obtained indicating that last kilnsâ€™ use occurred almost simultaneously or closely confined in time in the AD 14th century.

Dating resolution obtained is comparable to radiocarbon with the benefit that archaeomagnetism dates the last use (abandonment) of the structures and no material associated to it which might be younger.
