Affective analytics of demonstration sites

PARAGRAPH

The main objective of this research was a multiple criteria, affective analysis of public spaces constituting cultural heritage (buildings, parks, squares, streets) and events (music, exhibitions, festivals) with the help of Affective Analytics of Demonstration Sites (ANDES).

ANDES assists experts in more effective implementation of public spaces planning and participating in a process involving attendees/ visitors.

This process involves collecting from visitors and examining various emotional parameters (emotions, valence, arousal) and physiological parameters (average crowd facial temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, crowd composition by sex and age group).

Real-time mapping of the above-named parameters of people attending public spaces is conducted, producing personalized tips on ways to make public spaces (events) more efficient and public-centric.
