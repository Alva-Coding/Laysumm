TITLE

Collision risk prediction for visually impaired people using high level information fusion

PARAGRAPH

This project allows the visually impaired to improve the comprehension of their context by generating a risk map following an analysis of the position, distance, size and motion of the objects present in their environment.

This comprehension is refined by data fusion steps applied to predict possible impacts in the near future.

A risk map is made up of probabilities generated after executing a set of inferences.

These inferences allow the evaluation of future collision risks in different directions by detecting static objects, detecting free passage and analyzing paths followed by dynamic objects in a 3D plane.
