ABSTRACT

TITLE

Epileptic spasms as the presenting seizure type in a patient with a new “O” of TORCH, congenital Zika virus infection

PARAGRAPH

Congenital TORCH infections are a significant cause of epileptic spasms, an infantile epileptic encephalopathy, through disruptions to several pathways in neurodevelopment.

Congenital Zika virus has a similar neurotropism to other TORCH agents, and leads to microcephaly, severe neurodevelopmental impairment, and high rates of early onset seizures.

Here we report a child with confirmed congenital Zika virus who developed extensor epileptic spasms and hypsarrhythmia associated with a loss of early developmental milestones.

Early treatment led to resolution of epileptic spasms and improved developmental trajectory, though the child continues to have ongoing focal seizures and prominent developmental impairment.

Congenital Zika virus infection requires close monitoring as early identification of epileptic spasms is likely important in long term developmental outcome.
