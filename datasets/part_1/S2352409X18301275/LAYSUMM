TITLE

The archaeometric identification of the marbles of the Roman shipwrecks of Capo Granitola (TP), Isola delle Correnti and Marzamemi I (SR)

PARAGRAPH

The Roman cargos of Capo Granitola, Isola delle Correnti and Marzamemi have been object of systematic investigation which have allowed their 3D documentation and the systematic sampling of the stones.

The archaeometric analysis of the marble samples included minero-petrographic (XRD, OM on thin sections) and geochemical analyses (MS for SIRA and XRF); a few samples were subjected to quantitative chemical analysed of trace elements by XRF to confirm the provenancing of their marbles.

The results were compared with mineropetrographic and geochemical databases.

They have indicated that the marble of all the shipwrecks is from the island of Proconnesos.

Further to this marble, in the Marzamemi cargo also a block of Pentelic was present while in the Isola delle Correnti site fragments of slabs of lunense were indentified.
