ABSTRACT

TITLE

LA-ICP-MS labels early medieval Tuscan finds from Siena and Donoratico as late natron glass

PARAGRAPH

The late antique/early medieval age in Central Italy is a well-suited context to verify the implications of the end of the natron glass supplies, and to explore the beginnings of the new plant-ash glass technology.

We present the results of a LA-ICP-MS analysis campaign conducted on archaeological glass finds excavated at the Santa Maria della Scala hospital site in Siena and in Donoratico.

This provided us with major, minor and trace element quantitative data for 49 glass samples belonging to drinking vessels and lamps, dated mainly between the 5th and the 8th century.

On the basis of these data, we have sought to identify the working processes and possible glassware trade that are reflected in the glass composition.

Major and minor element contents revealed that most samples, also at the later boundary of the explored timeframe, fit well within known late Roman glass classifications (e.g. HIMT, Levantine).

Trace element analysis provided further information on the raw materials that were used in the glassmaking process, indicating the use of coastal sands as a silica source and allowing us to formulate different hypotheses on the materials used for the colouring process.
