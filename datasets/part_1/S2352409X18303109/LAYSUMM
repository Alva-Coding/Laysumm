TITLE

LA-ICP-MS labels early medieval Tuscan finds from Siena and Donoratico as late natron glass

PARAGRAPH

The late antique/early medieval age in Central Italy is a well-suited context to verify the implications of the end of the natron glass supplies, and to explore the beginnings of the new plant-ash glass technology.

We present the results of a LA-ICP-MS analysis campaign conducted on archaeological glass finds excavated at the Santa Maria della Scala hospital site in Siena and in Donoratico.

The collected samples fit well within known late Roman glass classifications (e.g. HIMT, Levantine).

Trace element analysis provided further information on the raw materials that were used, which provided information on the glassmaking and the colouring processes.
