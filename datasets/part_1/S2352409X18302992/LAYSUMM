TITLE

Identification of dermestid beetle modification on Neolithic Maltese human bone: Implications for funerary practices at the Xemxija tombs

PARAGRAPH

Modifications to human bones from six underground tombs in Malta, dated to between 3500-2450 BC, have been analysed to identify their origin.

Due to the size and shape of the modifications, they are shown to be the result of dermestid beetle feeding damage and burrowing.

Since dermestid beetles would not have originally been present in the tombs, these results advance our understanding of funerary practices in Neolithic Malta.

Analysis of the human remains indicates most individuals were buried soon after death.

We argue that the beetles were transported into the tombs, perhaps in hide wrappings, during the burial process.
