TITLE

General structure of Interval Type-2 fuzzy PI/PD controller of Takagiâ€“Sugeno type

PARAGRAPH

In this paper a general structure is presented for an Interval Type-2 (IT2) fuzzy two-term controller of Takagi-Sugeno (TS) type using a novel configuration.

The general structure provides flexibility in controller design.

The proposed structure is general in the sense that the user can select any number of fuzzy sets and the shape (triangular or trapezoidal) of their membership functions.

The structure can be directly plugged in to control different dynamical systems by simply tuning the parameters of the fuzzy controller.

This controller can be used much similar to the conventional (linear) two-term controllers but with better performance than its counterparts (linear and type-1 fuzzy controllers).
