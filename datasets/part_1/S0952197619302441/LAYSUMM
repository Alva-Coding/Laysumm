TITLE

Device free human gesture recognition using Wi-Fi CSI: A survey

PARAGRAPH

Recognizing human gestures have become an inevitable part in various fields like surveillance, entertainment, healthcare, etc.

This survey classifies the recognition task using two techniques; device-based method and device-free method.

The implementation of device-free method are identified under two different approaches; model-based and learning â€“based.

In depth studies of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning algorithms (DL) are presented under learning-based strategies.

Various signals pre-processing, feature extraction, selection, and classification techniques that are widely adopted for gesture recognition along with the environmental factors that influence the recognition accuracy are discussed.

It was reported that Channel State Information (CSI), a metric of Wi-Fi (device-free sensing method) shows better recognition performance compared to another techniques.

This survey spots the challenges and opportunities in device-free gesture recognition using Wi-Fi CSI.
