ABSTRACT

TITLE

Improving the chronological framework for Laugerie-Haute Ouest (Dordogne, France)

PARAGRAPH

Laugerie-Haute is one of the key sequences of the European Upper Paleolithic.

However, the absolute chronology of the sequence is not well-established, and recently the integrity of the layers has been called into question.

In this paper, we present new radiocarbon dating results for the entire sedimentary sequence at Laugerie-Haute Ouest, which contains important “Aurignacian V” and Solutrean assemblages.

Our results show that the entire Laugerie-Haute Ouest sequence was deposited in a period of 8500–10,000 years, dating between 28 and 19 cal.
