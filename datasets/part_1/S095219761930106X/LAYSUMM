TITLE

Batch and data streaming classification models for detecting adverse events and understanding the influencing factors

PARAGRAPH

This study investigates the effectiveness of batch and data streaming classification algorithms in detecting adverse events in a war theater based on infrastructure development spending data and other variables.

From the country level, fewer of the project investments affect the adverse events than the project investments at the region level.

The study also uses cost-sensitive measures to address the unbalanced nature of the data.

The results demonstrate that data streaming algorithms often outperform batch algorithms.

In addition, the data stream setting allows one to observe the performance of the models over time and detect concept drift due to changing data distribution.
