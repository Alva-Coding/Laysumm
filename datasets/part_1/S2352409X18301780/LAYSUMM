PARAGRAPH

Chemical composition and microstructural analyses were jointly applied to determining the provenance of the ceramic samples excavated from the Dong Xia sites in Russia's Primorye region.

The Ancient Ceramic Database of Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences provided the data of the reference wares for comparison.

Seventeen samples were confirmed as the Ding ware, Jun-series ware and Ru ware respectively.

The Ru ware is identified for the first time in the Dong Xia sites.

This research is a successful case of interdisciplinary cooperation in the medieval archaeometry of the Far East.
