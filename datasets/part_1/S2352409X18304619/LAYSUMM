TITLE

Variability in obsidian structural water content and its importance in the hydration dating of cultural artifacts

PARAGRAPH

Obsidian is widely present at archaeological sites in the form of domestic refuse.The occurrence of surface water diffusion on these artifacts, and the formation of hydration layers over time, permits the chronometric dating of the specimens and the contexts in which they occur.

Several environmental and chemical variables impact the rate of water diffusion, with the internal structural water of the glass being one of the most influential parameters.

Our analysis of over 30 geological deposits shows that internal structural water may be highly variable within an ancient quarry but can be monitored by measurement of the glass specific gravity, or density.

Using infrared spectroscopic analysis a calibration has been developed that relates obsidian density to structural water concentration in order that the appropriate hydration rate constants may be applied.
