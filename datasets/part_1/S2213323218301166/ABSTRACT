ABSTRACT

TITLE

Routine replacement of a vagal nerve stimulator generator leading to asystole

PARAGRAPH

A 52-year-old female with a longstanding history of drug-resistant epilepsy that included focal impaired awareness seizure presented at end of service of her vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) generator.

She had undergone a generator replacement in 2010 without complication.

However, her latest replacement was accompanied by multiple bouts of asystole.

We discuss the case, possible causes of the asystole, and its relevance to the future of VNS generator replacement and epilepsy treatment.
