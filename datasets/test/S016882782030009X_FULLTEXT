TITLE

Thyroid hormone inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma progression via induction of differentiation and metabolic reprogramming

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the third most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide,1 represents an important challenge for global health.

Despite an important increase in incidence, current therapeutic options for HCC remain unsatisfactory.2

PARAGRAPH

Thyroid hormones, namely 3,5,3’-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) and 3,5,3’,5’-tetraiodo-L-thyronine (thyroxine or T4), influence a variety of physiological processes, including development, metabolism, cell growth and proliferation.3,4

Although it has been proposed that rapid non-genomic mechanisms initiated at the cell membrane could mediate thyroid hormone activity,5 most of the effects of thyroid hormones on cellular proliferation and differentiation are driven by the thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), TRα and TRβ.3,4

The liver is an important target organ of thyroid hormones where TRβ represents the most abundant isoform.6

PARAGRAPH

In the last years, growing evidence has demonstrated that thyroid hormones and TRs are implicated in HCC development.

Indeed, 2 case-control studies suggested that hypothyroidism represents a risk factor for HCC.7,8

In the first study, Hassan et al. observed an increased association between hypothyroidism and HCC in women, independent of established HCC risk factors; in the second study, hypothyroidism was significantly more prevalent in patients with HCC of unknown etiology.

In addition, a recent work showed that TRβ expression correlated with more progressed stages of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a pro-tumorigenic condition.9

These results suggest that hypothyroidism may represent a permissive factor for HCC development.

PARAGRAPH

In addition, a state of severe local hypothyroidism, revealed by downregulation of TRβ and Deiodinase1 (Dio1) mRNA levels has been identified in the most aggressive rat hepatic preneoplastic lesions, characterized by their positivity for the stem/progenitor cell marker cytokeratin-19 (KRT-19),10 and in rat and human HCCs.11,12

Finally, the finding that increased expression of these genes upon T3 treatment was associated with preneoplastic nodule regression10 suggests that local reactivation of the T3/TR axis in cancer cells may impact on HCC development.

PARAGRAPH

Based on this premise, we investigated whether reactivation of the T3/TR axis in fully developed HCCs could impact on their progression, even when the hormone is administered at late phases.

This is relevant, as HCC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage when it is not amenable to curative treatments.

Collectively, our findings show that T3 acts as a potent antitumoral agent, most likely by prompting a differentiation program and a metabolic switch.

Results

SECTION

T3 induces a global shift of the expression profile of preneoplastic lesions towards that of fully differentiated hepatocytes

PARAGRAPH

Using the resistant hepatocyte (R-H) model of hepatocarcinogenesis (see supplementary materials and methods) we previously showed that a 7-day treatment with T3 to rats bearing hepatic nodules induced a rapid regression of these preneoplastic lesions, in the absence of clear signs of cell death.15

To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed regression, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of laser-microdissected preneoplastic nodules at 2 and 4 days after T3 treatment, times that precede the disappearance of the nodules.

A total of 869 out of 21,791 genes included in the array were selected as described in the supplementary materials and methods.

Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis stratified the rat lesions of T3-untreated animals into 2 major clusters: i) normal liver and preneoplastic lesions negative for KRT-19; ii) the most aggressive preneoplastic KRT-19+ lesions.14

T3 administration for 4 days induced a shift in the gene expression profile of KRT-19+ lesions towards that of normal liver and indolent preneoplastic KRT-19- lesions (as evidenced by unsupervised co-clustering).

Conversely, no major gene expression profile changes were observed after 2 days of treatment (Fig. 1A).

These results suggest that the T3-induced reprogramming of poorly differentiated hepatocytes to a more mature phenotype precedes the disappearance of preneoplastic lesions.

Indeed, the ratio between the most aggressive and poorly differentiated KRT-19+ nodules and those KRT-19- before and after T3 treatment was 0.33 and 0.14, respectively.

According to our previous findings,16 nodule regression was not associated with increased apoptosis (compared to untreated rats), as revealed by histology and immunohistochemical detection of activated caspase-3 (data not shown).

SECTION

T3 treatment modulates pathways and transcription factors related to the acquisition/maintenance of a differentiated phenotype

PARAGRAPH

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the genes differentially expressed in KRT-19+ preneoplastic lesions after 4 days of T3 treatment vs. untreated lesions, revealed their involvement in metabolic pathways, such as those related to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/interleukin (IL)-1-mediated inhibition of retinoic-X-receptor (RXR) function, NRF2-mediated oxidative response and glutathione-mediated detoxification (Fig. 1B).

Remarkably, T3 treatment caused activation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (Hnf1a), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha (Hnf4a) and CCAAT-enhancer binding protein alpha (Cebpa) involved in the acquisition/maintenance of the differentiated hepatocyte phenotype17 (Fig. 1C).

Among the T3-activated transcription factors, it was of particular interest to find Klf9, a Kruppel-like factor that contains a thyroid hormone response element and is implicated in the regulation of the balance between pluripotency, self-renewal, differentiation, and metabolism18–20 (Fig. S4).

Of note, some of the most deregulated genes were direct targets of TRβ or Klf9, as shown by ChIP analysis (Fig. S5).

PARAGRAPH

To further investigate the pro-differentiating effect of T3, we determined the expression of genes involved in hepatocyte differentiation.

As previously shown,10 hepatic preneoplastic nodules are characterized by a local hypothyroid state.

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that T3 treatment reverted this status, as revealed by the strong induction of the TRβ-target gene deiodinase 1 (Dio1) (Fig. 2A).

Dio1 upregulation was accompanied by a profound downregulation of the stem/progenitor cell marker Krt-19 (Fig. 2B,E).

Concomitantly, the expression of the pro-differentiating transcription factors Klf9 and Hnf4a – strongly decreased in preneoplastic nodules – was upregulated following T3 treatment (Fig. 2C and D).

The T3-induced shift towards a differentiated phenotype was further supported by histochemical analysis showing reacquisition of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activity, an established marker of differentiated hepatocytes that occurred concomitantly with loss of activity of the preneoplastic marker gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), which is not expressed by differentiated hepatocytes (Fig. 2F).

SECTION

HCCs are still responsive to T3

PARAGRAPH

Since human HCC is often diagnosed at late stages and treatment options are limited and generally poorly effective, to attribute a clinical relevance to T3 it was important to determine whether not only preneoplastic lesions but also HCCs were responsive to the hormone.

Therefore, animals exposed to the R-H model were sacrificed 10 months after diethylnitrosamine (DEN) treatment.

At necropsy, tumors were macroscopically evident in all animals and displayed the typical histological features of HCC, such as irregular edges, with an infiltrating pattern of growth, a marked cellular pleomorphism with mild nuclear atypia, and the normal lobular architecture being replaced by thick trabeculae of neoplastic hepatocytes (Fig. 3A).

Remaining rats were divided into 2 groups and fed for 1 week with either basal diet or T3-supplemented diet (Fig. S1B).

qRT-PCR analysis showed that HCCs from untreated rats, similarly to preneoplastic nodules, exhibited diminished Dio1 mRNA levels that returned to basal values following 1 week of treatment with T3 (Fig. 3B).

Restoration of the T3/TR axis in HCCs of T3-treated rats was associated with a strong reduction of Gstp and Krt-19 expression (Fig. 3C,E).

Notably, while a significant increase of Klf9 was observed after T3 (Fig. 3D), no such change was found for Cebpα, Cebpβ, Foxa2 and Foxa3 (Fig. S6).

SECTION

T3 reduces HCC number and burden

PARAGRAPH

Having established that HCCs are still responsive to T3 administration, we investigated whether T3 treatment of HCC-bearing animals could interfere with tumor progression.

To this aim, 10 months after DEN treatment rats were exposed to 5 cycles of T3-supplemented diet (1 week/every 3 weeks) and sacrificed 3.5 months afterward (Fig. S2A).

Livers of T3-exposed rats were characterized by very few macroscopic HCCs, while animals fed normal diet displayed large and multiple HCCs (Fig. 4A,B).

A reduction in tumor burden was associated with a significant decrease in liver weight (Fig. 4C).

Light microscopy examination confirmed a significant reduction of the neoplastic area in T3-treated rats (Fig. 4D).

Moreover, microscopic observation revealed that lesions with features of adenomas were predominant in the livers of T3-treated animals – with only rare tumors displaying HCC features – while well- or poorly differentiated HCCs predominated in rats fed a basal diet (Fig. 4E).

This result reinforces the hypothesis that thyroid hormone induces differentiation of neoplastic cells towards a more benign phenotype.

PARAGRAPH

As observed in preneoplastic nodules, restoration of the T3/TR axis, confirmed by the increase of TRβ-target genes Dio1 and Spot14 expression, was paralleled by Gstp and Krt-19 downregulation (Fig. 5A-E).

Concomitantly to the loss of the fetal markers GSTP, KRT-19 and GGT, reacquisition of G6Pase activity was observed in the livers of T3-treated rats (Fig. S7A and Table S2).

T3 treatment also induced several HNF4a-positive hepatocyte nuclei (Fig. 5F), together with increased Klf9 mRNA levels and nuclear localization (Fig. 5G,H).

Interestingly, the expression of Notch3 and Hey2 genes, belonging to the Notch signaling pathway involved in the maintenance of stemness and known to display a T3-response,20 was downregulated upon T3 treatment (Fig. 5I,J).

Altogether, these results demonstrate that T3 massively impairs HCC progression, likely promoting differentiation of neoplastic hepatocytes.

PARAGRAPH

Notably, as observed in early preneoplastic lesions, no sign of increased apoptosis was observed in the livers of HCC-bearing animals treated with T3, as determined by caspase-3 immunostaining (Fig. S7B).

PARAGRAPH

An additional rat model was used to test the antitumorigenic ability of T3, wherein the clonal expansion of DEN-initiated cells is promoted by a steato-necrogenic environment generated by 4 month-feeding with a choline-devoid, methionine-deficient (CMD) diet (Fig. S3A).

Ten months after DEN treatment at least 1 small HCC was observed in all animals.

Treatment with 5 cycles of T3-supplemented diet (1 week/every 3 weeks) caused a striking reduction in the number of rats displaying macroscopic tumors (2/8; 25%), when compared to that of animals not exposed to the hormone (4/5; 80%) and in the number of tumors/rat (average: 0.25 vs. 2.4) (Fig. S7C,D,E).

SECTION

T3 inhibits the growth of human HCC cells and their in vivo tumorigenic ability

PARAGRAPH

To directly establish the antitumorigenic properties of T3, we evaluated its effect on cell growth and colony forming ability of human HCC cells.

While TRβ transduction did not significantly modify the basal growth ability of either the cell lines (data not shown), treatment with T3 severely impaired the capacity of Mahlavu and HepG2 cells to grow both in adhesion (Fig. 6A and Fig. S8A) and in the absence of anchorage (Fig. 6B and Fig. S8B).

This effect was more evident in cells transduced with TRβ.

Notably, the mRNA levels of TRβ were similar in both Mahlavu and HepG2 cells (Fig. S8C).

As in vitro treatment with T3 significantly induced KLF9 expression in both Mahlavu and HepG2 cells (Fig. 6C and Fig. S8D), we investigated whether the antitumorigenic activity of T3 was linked to KLF9-mediated neoplastic cell differentiation.

As shown, KLF9 silencing significantly impaired the T3 inhibitory effect on anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 6D and Fig. S8E,F).

Moreover, T3 treatment greatly reduced tumor growth of both TRβ-transduced and not transduced Mahlavu cells when injected into the posterior flank of nude mice (Fig. 6E).

SECTION

TRβ/KLF9 axis is affected in a chronic model of rat hepatocarcinogenesis and in human HCC

PARAGRAPH

Evidence supporting the role of TRβ/KLF9 axis in HCC development was further investigated in an additional rat model consisting of chronic treatment with DEN (Fig. S3B).

qRT-PCR analysis indeed showed a highly significant downregulation of Klf9 and TRβ in HCCs vs. surrounding livers and a strong positive Pearson correlation between the 2 genes (Fig. S9A,B).

PARAGRAPH

To investigate whether a similar correlation also exists in human HCC – and thus if this finding has translational value – KLF9 and TRβ mRNA levels were determined in a cohort of 45 patients subjected to HCC resection (study population characteristics are described in Table S1).

As observed in rats, TRβ and KLF9 were downregulated in 66% and 60% of human HCCs, respectively, when compared to matched non-cancerous cirrhotic tissues (Fig. S9C,D, left panels).

Importantly, a significantly positive correlation between KLF9 and TRβ levels was observed (Fig. S9C, right panels).

Notably, in both rat and human HCCs we also found a highly significant positive correlation between TRβ and KLF9, and between HNF4a and KLF9 (Fig. S9A-D, right panels).

SECTION

The antitumorigenic effect of T3 is long-lasting and is maintained upon hormone removal

PARAGRAPH

To investigate whether the inhibition of HCC progression observed in T3-fed rats is a reversible process that depends on the presence of exogenous T3 or it is long-standing, one further group of animals was switched back to basal diet following the 5th cycle with T3-supplemented diet and sacrificed 1 month afterward (See Fig. S2B).

The results showed that the livers of rats exposed to the hormone were smaller than those of untreated animals and displayed very few macroscopic tumors even after T3 withdrawal (Fig. 7A).

Light microscopy analysis showed that the average neoplastic area remained significantly reduced in T3-treated animals (Fig. 7B).

Intriguingly, the T3/TR axis was still partially restored compared to untreated animals, as evidenced by the significantly higher expression of Dio1 and Spot14, even 1 month after T3 withdrawal (Fig. 7C,D).

Of note, the levels of the neoplastic marker Krt-19 did not significantly increase following T3 removal but stayed at levels similar to those in rats killed immediately after the 5th cycle, remaining downregulated compared to T3-untreated rats (Fig. 7E).

SECTION

T3-induced metabolic rewiring precedes preneoplastic nodule regression

PARAGRAPH

Recent evidence supports a link between metabolism and cell differentiation.21–23

Based on our previous findings that aggressive preneoplastic lesions and HCCs are characterized by a rewiring of cellular metabolism towards an enhanced glycolytic phenotype (i.e. Warburg),24 we investigated whether the T3-prodifferentiative effect was associated with a rerouting of metabolites from a Warburg metabolism to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).

PARAGRAPH

We first analyzed the expression profile of the 16 metabolic genes involved in glycolysis, significantly altered in preneoplastic lesions in the array described in Fig. 1A. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis stratified rat lesions into 2 major clusters: i) preneoplastic KRT-19+ lesions, and ii) normal liver and preneoplastic KRT-19+ lesions exposed to T3 for 2 or 4 days (Fig. 8A).

Interestingly, T3 treatment severely affected the expression of metabolic genes as early as 2 days after treatment, a time when no major effect in the global expression profile was observed (Fig. 1A).

The most marked T3-induced changes were observed in genes belonging to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).

Indeed, the expression levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6pd, the rate-limiting enzyme of the oxidative branch of the PPP), phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Pgd) and Transaldolase1 (Taldo1) were significantly downregulated by T3 (Fig. 8A).

PARAGRAPH

Along with diversion of glycolytic metabolites into the PPP, mitochondrial respiration is impaired in preneoplastic lesions.24

Crucially, T3 administration rapidly restored the activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), an indicator of mitochondrial functionality, hence impacting the metabolic phenotype of preneoplastic lesions (Fig. 8B).

SECTION

T3 administration reverts HCC metabolic profile

PARAGRAPH

Next, we assessed if the inhibitory effect of T3 on HCC progression is accompanied by a reversion of the tumor metabolic profiles.

One-week T3 treatment of HCC bearing rats (10 months after DEN) rescued normal glycolytic activity, as revealed by decreased expression of hexokinase 2 (Hk2) and glucose transporter-1 (Glut1) (Fig. S10A).

As observed in preneoplastic nodules, T3 also strongly downregulated the expression and activity of G6pd (Fig. S10B), Taldo1 and Transketolase (Tkt) levels in these tumors (Fig. S10C).

PARAGRAPH

Based on the finding that G6PD and Taldo1 are targets of the transcription factor Nrf2, PPP activation has been proposed as one of the mechanisms by which deregulation of Nrf2/Keap1 signaling promotes tumorigenesis.25

Since T3 strongly decreased G6pd, Taldo1 and Tkt expression (Fig. 8D), we investigated whether thyroid hormone could impact the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway.

As shown in Fig. S11, while the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway was strongly activated in HCCs, after 5 cycles of the T3 regimen we observed a strong decrease of the mRNA (Fig. S11A) and protein levels (Fig. S11B) of Nqo1, the best known Nrf2 target gene, proving Nrf2 pathway inhibition.

PARAGRAPH

Enzymatic activity assays displayed increased activity of complex I and II of the respiratory chain in liver tissues belonging to the hormone-treated group (Fig. S10D).

These results are in line with a previous study reporting that the reduction of glycolysis caused by HK2 knockdown in hepatoma cell lines led to a compensatory upregulation of OXPHOS.26

PARAGRAPH

T3-induced changes in metabolic genes were even more pronounced following 5 cycles of the T3-supplemented diet (Fig. 8C,D).

Indeed, we observed a clear switch from high Hk2 expression to that of glucokinase (Gck), the enzyme that, in normal hepatocytes, catalyzes the first committed step in glucose metabolism.27

This switch was accompanied by Glut1 and Mct4 downregulation (Fig.8C).

A similar effect on metabolic genes was observed in HepG2 cells treated with T3 (Fig. S12A).

Five cycles of T3 diet also reversed the enhanced expression of Taldo1, Tkt and G6pd usually associated with HCC (Fig. 8D).

G6PD activity was also significantly decreased by T3 (Fig. 8D).

T3's ability to interfere with PPP activation was also demonstrated in HepG2 and Mahlavu cells, as shown by decreased CO2 production from glucose radiolabeled in position 1 (CO2 derived from both OXPHOS and PPP) when subtracting glucose radiolabeled in position 6 (CO2 exclusively derived from OXPHOS) (Fig. 8E and S12B).

These findings are further reinforced by mass spectrometry analysis showing a significant reduction of ribose-5-phosphate (i.e. the final product of the oxidative branch of the PPP) in tumor tissue derived from HCC-bearing rats undergoing T3 treatment (Fig. S12C).

In agreement with the results shown in Fig. S12C, enzymatic activity assays performed on the livers of rats exposed to 5 cycles of T3 exhibited increased activity of complex I and II of the respiratory chain (Fig. 8F).

These data were further confirmed by histochemical analysis of serial frozen sections showing reactivation of SDH activity after T3 treatment (Fig. S13).

Interestingly, the reduced levels of R5P in the T3-treated samples are accompanied by a significant increase in phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) and pyruvate, metabolites that can fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle, assayed using GC-MS.

Indeed, citrate and malate levels are increased and can be considered as a readout of an enhanced tricarboxylic acid cycle (Fig. S12C).

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

The most important findings achieved in this study are: i) fully developed HCCs are responsive to T3, ii) giving repeated cycles of T3 to HCC-bearing rats strongly impairs HCC progression, iii) the antitumorigenic effect of T3 is durable, lasting after T3 removal, iv) re-differentiation and the metabolic switch from glycolysis to OXPHOS precede the regression of early lesions and impair HCC progression, v) the T3/TR axis is altered in human HCCs.

PARAGRAPH

Thyroid hormones and their receptors are involved in differentiation and metamorphosis28 and T3 accelerates differentiation of oval/liver progenitor cells to hepatocytes, leading to loss of oval cell-specific markers and acquisition of a mature hepatocyte phenotype.29

PARAGRAPH

In the RH model used in the present study, the biochemical phenotype of preneoplastic nodules resembles that of fetal hepatocytes, as these lesions lack the expression of enzymes normally present in differentiated hepatocytes, while exhibiting high levels of proteins poorly expressed/absent in fully differentiated hepatocytes.30

Here, we demonstrate that T3 exerts its effects on preneoplastic nodules and HCCs by inducing genes responsible for acquisition/maintenance of hepatocyte differentiation, such as Klf9 and Hnf4a, and by inhibiting genes expressed in less-differentiated hepatocytes, such as Krt-19, Gstp, Ggt.

Our data also imply that the TR/KLF9 network is involved in the reactivation of the differentiation program.

The Sp1/KLF transcription factor family plays different roles in cellular growth, development, differentiation and inflammation.18,20,31

In particular, Klf9 expression greatly influences cell differentiation processes.

Recently, Cvoro et al.20 showed that TRs cooperate with KLF9 to regulate hepatocyte differentiation and TR activation leads to KLF9 induction in transformed and non-transformed liver cells, and in stem cells.

KLF9 was downregulated in human HCCs while KLF9 transduction in HCC cell lines inhibited proliferation and tumorigenesis.32

Remarkably, we observed a strong decrease of Klf9 mRNA levels in preneoplastic lesions and HCCs, paralleled by reduced TRβ expression, and its significant upregulation following T3 treatment.

These data were confirmed in an additional model of rat hepatocarcinogenesis and in human HCCs.

The finding that T3 impaired growth of human hepatocarcinoma cell lines and that this effect was partially reverted upon KLF9 silencing supports a role of the TR/KLF9 axis in the antitumoral effect of T3.

PARAGRAPH

Interestingly, in the model of HCC+T3 administration and T3 withdrawal we observed that the antitumoral effects were maintained 1 month after T3 removal.

We hypothesize that restoration of the T3/TR axis, persisting even at 1 month after T3 withdrawal – as evaluated by the increased expression of Dio1 and Spot14 – might in part explain the long-lasting activity of thyroid hormone.

PARAGRAPH

Another important observation stemming from this study is that a metabolic switch from glycolysis to oxidative-dependent metabolism is an early event in the antitumorigenic effect exerted by T3.

This is in line with the notion that differentiation requires a fundamental shift in the metabolic landscape of the cell.33

Unlike normal cells, most neoplastic cells undergo an important metabolic shift, known as the Warburg effect, in which glucose utilization is favored and OXPHOS is downregulated, even when oxygen availability is plentiful.34

Nwosu et al. found more than 600 consistently altered metabolic genes in human HCCs.35

Moreover, in the R-H model, metabolic reprogramming is a feature observed from very early stages that persists up to fully developed HCC, suggesting that it has critical role in HCC onset and progression.

Concerning T3, several reports have described its effect on the metabolic behavior of cancer cells.

Indeed, T3 sensitized mitochondrial metabolism in triple-negative breast cancer cells displaying a marked Warburg effect.36

In addition, T3 was shown to increase mitochondrial function and respiration in HCC cells.37,38

In our study, the most marked T3-induced changes affected PPP, in particular G6PD, the limiting enzyme of the PPP oxidative branch.39,40

G6PD expression was completely abolished after T3 treatment, both in nodules and in HCCs, and remained low after T3 removal.

Notably, in human HCC, G6PD expression is upregulated and associated with high tumor grade, metastasis and poor overall survival.24

PARAGRAPH

Our findings demonstrate that T3 acts as a potent antitumoral agent and are in line with other reports suggesting that T3 administration interferes with HCC development.38,41

In fact, T3 suppressed HCC onset in DEN-treated mice via activation of mitophagy37 and in HBV-encoded X protein-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.38

PARAGRAPH

Collectively, these findings shed light on the possibility of targeting the T3/TR axis in HCC therapy.

Unfortunately, T3-based therapies often result in undesired side effects, particularly cardiac dysfunctions,42 which hamper their clinical use.

Nonetheless, new thyroid hormone analogs devoid of the cardiac toxic effects of thyroid hormone are now available and worth testing in clinical trials.
