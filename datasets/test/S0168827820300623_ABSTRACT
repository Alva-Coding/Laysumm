ABSTRACT

TITLE

Long-term growth and bone development in children of HBV-infected mothers with and without fetal exposure to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate

PARAGRAPH

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is the preferred treatment to prevent maternal transmission of HBV, owing to its efficacy and safety.

However, data are lacking on the long-term safety outcomes in children following fetal exposure to TDF.

PARAGRAPH

Children participating in a prospective, multisite trial of maternal TDF treatment during late pregnancy were recruited for follow-up visits once a year.

Growth parameters, serum biochemistry, HBV serology, and bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometery scan were measured.

PARAGRAPH

One hundred and twenty-eight children, 71 in the TDF and 57 in the control group, completed 255 follow-up visits at the age of 2 to 7 (median, 4.08) years.

No differences in z-scores for weight-for-age (0.26 ± 0.90 vs. 0.22 ± 0.99, p = 0.481), z-scores for height-for-age (0.20 ± 1.02 vs. 0.25 ± 0.98, p = 0.812), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (169.12 ± 50.48 vs. 169.06 ± 34.46 ml/min/1.73m2, p = 0.479) were detected.

After adjustment for age, sex and HBV status by multiple linear regression, children in the TDF and control group had comparable levels of serum calcium, phosphorus, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, calcidiol and BMD of lumbar spines (0.55 ± 0.01 vs. 0.57 ± 0.01 g/cm2, p = 0.159) and left hip (0.56 ± 0.01 vs. 0.56 ± 0.01 g/cm2, p = 0.926).

PARAGRAPH

Children of HBV-infected mothers who did or did not receive tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treatment during late pregnancy had comparable long-term growth, renal function, and bone development up to 6–7 years after delivery.
