ABSTRACT

TITLE

A dual role for hepatocyte-intrinsic canonical NF-κB signaling in virus control

PARAGRAPH

Hepatic innate immune control of viral infections has largely been attributed to Kupffer cells, the liver-resident macrophages.

However, hepatocytes, the parenchymal cells of the liver, also possess potent immunological functions in addition to their known metabolic functions.

Owing to their abundance in the liver and known immunological functions, we aimed to investigate the direct antiviral mechanisms employed by hepatocytes.

PARAGRAPH

Using lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) as a model of liver infection, we first assessed the role of myeloid cells by depletion prior to infection.

We investigated the role of hepatocyte-intrinsic innate immune signaling by infecting mice lacking canonical NF-κB signaling (IkkβΔHep) specifically in hepatocytes.

In addition, mice lacking hepatocyte-specific interferon-α/β signaling-(IfnarΔHep), or interferon-α/β signaling in myeloid cells-(IfnarΔMyel) were infected.

PARAGRAPH

Here, we demonstrate that LCMV activates NF-κB signaling in hepatocytes.

LCMV-triggered NF-κB activation in hepatocytes did not depend on Kupffer cells or TNFR1 signaling but rather on Toll-like receptor signaling.

LCMV-infected IkkβΔHep livers displayed strongly elevated viral titers due to LCMV accumulation within hepatocytes, reduced interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, delayed intrahepatic immune cell influx and delayed intrahepatic LCMV-specific CD8+ T cell responses.

Notably, viral clearance and ISG expression were also reduced in LCMV-infected primary hepatocytes lacking IKKβ, demonstrating a hepatocyte-intrinsic effect.

Similar to livers of IkkβΔHep mice, enhanced hepatocytic LCMV accumulation was observed in livers of IfnarΔHep mice, whereas IfnarΔMyel mice were able to control LCMV infection.

Hepatocytic NF-κB signaling was also required for efficient ISG induction in HDV-infected dHepaRG cells and interferon-α/β-mediated inhibition of HBV replication in vitro.

PARAGRAPH

Together, these data show that hepatocyte-intrinsic NF-κB is a vital amplifier of interferon-α/β signaling, which is pivotal for strong early ISG responses, immune cell infiltration and hepatic viral clearance.
