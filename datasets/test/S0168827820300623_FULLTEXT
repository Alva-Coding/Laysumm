TITLE

Long-term growth and bone development in children of HBV-infected mothers with and without fetal exposure to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

HBV infection is a global health problem and mother-to-infant transmission is the major source of chronic HBV infection in endemic areas.1

Immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and vaccine starting soon after birth achieves >90% efficacy in preventing maternal transmission of HBV.2,3

However, approximately 5–10% of infants born to highly viremic mothers are still infected despite immunoprophylaxis.4–6

Recently, many studies have demonstrated that oral antiviral nucleos(t)ide analogues use in highly viremic mothers during late pregnancy successfully decreases maternal viral load and thus prevents mother-to-infant transmission.7

The nucleos(t)ide analogues used during pregnancy include lamivudine, telbivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF).

Among these nucleos(t)ide analogues, professional organization guidelines recommend TDF as a preferred choice, owing to its antiviral potency, safety data and lower rate of resistance.8,9

PARAGRAPH

Although TDF is generally well tolerated, decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and renal function impairment can occur in adult patients with long-term use.10,11

Given the increasing use of TDF in highly viremic HBV-infected pregnant women, data on the effects of fetal TDF exposure on children's growth, renal function, and bone development are urgently needed.

Data from the HIV literature are available but have been limited and controversial with most studies suggesting no effect of fetal TDF exposure on fetal/infant growth and/or bone development, and some studies showing decreased linear growth or bone mineral content in infants.12,13

Current studies involving HBV-infected women and their infants reported only short-term outcomes no longer than 1 year after birth.14–17

Long-term safety data for children is anticipated but is insufficient.9

In this study, we reported the renal function, long-term growth parameters, as well as bone development assessed by BMD measurements and serum markers related to bone metabolism, of the children born to HBV-infected mothers with and without TDF treatment from 30–32 gestational weeks until 1 month postpartum in a prospective, multisite trial.

Patients and methods

SECTION

Patients

PARAGRAPH

Children whose mother participated in a clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT01312012) on TDF use during late pregnancy to interrupt mother-to-infant transmission of HBV were invited to join the present study.

The trial was a prospective, multisite, open-labeled, non-randomized controlled trial and we continue to enroll eligible HBV-infected pregnant women and their infants.15

Participating mothers were HBV-infected pregnant women 20–40 years of age with an HBV DNA level ≥7.5 log10 IU/ml (=8.0 log10 copies/ml) and they joined in the control or TDF group based on their willingness.

Mothers who had used antiviral treatment during the first and/or second trimester were excluded.

Mothers with major systemic diseases, including renal insufficiency, heart disease, malignancy, liver cirrhosis, abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level >5x the upper limit of normal (40 U/L), or hepatic decompensation, coinfected with HIV or HCV, or with evidence of fetal congenital anomaly were excluded.

PARAGRAPH

From April 2011 to July 2016, mothers in the TDF group received TDF 300 mg once daily from gestational week 30–32 until 1 month following delivery, which was compatible with recommendations at that time.18

Mothers in the control group did not receive antiviral therapy.

All infants received HBIG 0.5 ml (100 IU) within 24 h of birth and hepatitis B vaccine at 0, 1, and 6 months.

Mothers in the TDF group were advised not to breast-feed during the first month because safety data regarding neonatal exposure to TDF through breast milk was insufficient in 2011-2016.18

Breast-feeding was encouraged after discontinuing TDF treatment.

All the participating children were followed up at 0, 6 and 12 months of age.15

These children were invited to join the present long-term follow-up study after 2 years of age and were followed once a year according to their willingness during the period from November 2015 to August 2018.

A total of 212 children candidates, including 119 in the TDF group and 93 in the control group, were invited.

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained from these children and children's parents or guardians.

SECTION

Methods

PARAGRAPH

At each visit, children's weight and height were measured.

Age and sex-adjusted z-scores of body weight and height were calculated based on the WHO International Child Growth Standards.19

Serum ALT, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) (LIAISON BAP OSTASE assay, DiaSorin, Italy), 25(OH)-vitamin D (calcidiol) (Elecsys Vitamin D Total assay, Roche) levels and HBV serological markers, including HBsAg and its antibody (anti-HBs), were tested.

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated by Schwartz formula.20

According to parents' and children's willingness, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometery (DXA) scans (GE lunar Prodigy, Wisconsin, U.S.A.) of the lumbar spines (L1-4) and the left hip were performed to evaluate BMD.

All participating children received DXA scans at the same site, National Taiwan University Hospital.

All DXA scans were conducted on the same machine by the same technologist team.

Phantom test was routinely performed for daily quality control.

SECTION

Statistical Analyses

PARAGRAPH

Statistical analyses were performed using Stata software (version 11.2, Stata Corporation).

Two-sided p ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Continuous variables were summarized as means with standard deviations or medians with interquartile ranges.

The group differences were examined using the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables or the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables.

During childhood growth, many physiological processes may affect bone metabolism and related markers.

The reference values of these markers vary among children of different ages.21

HBV infection may cause ALT elevation.

Therefore, serum ALT, calcium, phosphorus, BSAP, calcidiol and BMD were compared between the TDF and control group with adjustment for age, sex, and HBV status by means of multiple linear regression.

For the comparisons that were adjusted by covariates, data were reported as adjusted means with standard errors.

SECTION

Results

PARAGRAPH

One hundred and twenty-eight children, 71 in the TDF and 57 in the control group, completed 255 follow-up visits.

Of the 128 children enrolled, 1 child (1/71, 1.4%) in the TDF group and 6 children (6/57, 10.5%) in the control group had chronic HBV infection.

Each child joined one to three times of follow-up visits with an interval of 12 months between two visits.

Table 1 lists the number of children and the number of visits in the TDF and control group.

Children's age at each visit ranged from 2.0 to 7.0 (median, 4.08) years, and was comparable between the TDF and control group (Table 2).

The times of follow-up visits were comparable between the TDF and the control group (Table 1).

SECTION

Growth Indices

PARAGRAPH

The z-scores for weight-for-age and z-scores for height-for-age were comparable between the TDF group and the control group (Table 2).

Fig. 1 depicts the medians and interquartile ranges of the z-scores, based on the WHO international child growth standards, in different age groups with comparison to these children's z-scores for weight and height at 12 months of age.15

PARAGRAPH

The rate of breast milk ingestion, including exclusive breastfeeding and mixed breast milk and formula feeding, was lower in the TDF vs. control group (43.7% vs. 66.7%, p = 0.009).

In the TDF group, children with and without history of breast milk ingestion had comparable z-scores for weight-for-age and z-scores for height-for-age (Table S1).

SECTION

Markers related to bone development

PARAGRAPH

Children in the TDF and control group had similar serum calcium, phosphorus, BSAP and calcidiol levels after adjustment for age, sex and HBV status by multiple linear regression (Table 2).

SECTION

Bone mineral density

PARAGRAPH

A total of 73 children contributed 124 DXA scans, including 71 in the TDF group and 53 in the control group.

The BMD of the lumbar spines (L1- L4) and the left hip were similar between the TDF and control group after adjustment for age, sex and HBV status by multiple linear regression (Table 3).

Fig. 2 depicts the relationship of BMD and age by group.

Both the BMD of the lumbar spines and the left hip increased with age.

Children in the TDF and control group had comparable BMD levels.

SECTION

Renal function

PARAGRAPH

Children in the TDF group had similar eGFR, calculated by Schwartz formula,20 as those in the control group (Table 2).

SECTION

Immunity against HBV

PARAGRAPH

The anti-HBs levels and the percentages of children with adequate anti-HBs levels (≥10 mIU/ml) were comparable between the TDF and control group.

Children with chronic HBV infection were not included in the analysis of anti-HBs (Table 4).

No children who were HBsAg-negative at enrollment of the present study became HBsAg-positive during follow-up.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

This study presents the long-term outcomes of growth, bone development, renal function, and immunity against HBV in children born to highly viremic HBV-infected mothers with and without TDF treatment during late pregnancy until 1 month postpartum.

Our results were collected prospectively and coupled with longitudinal assessment from birth.15

Children with prenatal exposure to TDF had comparable growth, renal function, and bone development as those who were unexposed to TDF.

In addition to the short-term safety data from previous reports,14–17 our data provide evidence to support the use of TDF during late pregnancy, demonstrating the long-term safety of TDF with respect to childrens' growth, renal function and bone development.

PARAGRAPH

Previous studies showed that TDF passes across the placenta with a cord-to-maternal blood ratio ranging from 0.60 to 1.03 with chronic dosing in pregnant HIV-infected women.12,22

Tenofovir could be detected in the meconium of infants born to mothers taking TDF during pregnancy and the meconium tenofovir concentrations were not associated with infant's weight and length within 30 days of birth.23

Previous studies of TDF use during late pregnancy to prevent maternal transmission of HBV reported no effect on infant's growth at birth and at 6–12 months of age.14–17

Data on the long-term growth outcome in children with fetal exposure to TDF are limited, mainly from HIV-infected women and their children.

In those HIV studies, TDF was not the only antiviral drug used but was part of combination antiviral therapy.

By comparing the growth parameters in children born to HIV-infected, antiviral-treated women with and without TDF-containing regimens, there was no evidence that in utero TDF exposure affected children's growth at 2–6 years of age.24,25

In our study, TDF was the only antiviral drug used and the prospective long-term follow-up data show that prenatal exposure of TDF in children born to HBV-infected mothers does not affect children's growth up to 6–7 years of age.

The growth of the children in both the TDF and control group is comparable to that of general population, as specified by the WHO international child growth standards, which describe normal child growth under optimal environmental conditions and can be applied to all children worldwide.19

PARAGRAPH

The safety of antiviral therapy during breastfeeding has not been well studied in HBV-infected women.

In HIV-infected mothers treated with TDF, tenofovir in breast milk was detected at trivial concentrations.26

Currently, professional organization guidelines generally allow breastfeeding during tenofovir therapy in HBV-infected mothers and suggest discussing the low-level exposure of infants to TDF because of insufficient long-term safety data.8

Our data provide evidence that children with and without neonatal exposure to TDF through breast milk had comparable long-term growth.

PARAGRAPH

Long-term use of TDF is associated with BMD reduction in adult patients with HIV27,28 and HBV10,29 infection.

In those studies, the treatment duration ranged from 12 to 60 months.10,27–29

Few studies addressed the bone health of infants and children with in utero exposure to TDF, and the outcome measurements varied from hand/wrist/spine radiographs,30 fetal femur and humerus length assessed by ultrasound,31 bone metabolism markers,32 to DXA scans.13,23

Of those studies, only 1 study of HIV-exposed but uninfected infants with maternal TDF treatment for more than 8 weeks in late pregnancy reported lower neonatal bone mineral content in TDF-exposed infants.13

Other studies of infants born to HIV-infected mothers receiving TDF-containing antiviral therapy with treatment durations ranging from 3 to 41 gestational weeks reported no difference in fetal femur and humerus length z scores,31 bone metabolism markers, including BSAP and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen,32 and whole bone mineral content at 0–4 weeks of age.23

Unlike the HIV-infected mothers who might use TDF throughout the entire pregnancy, and might receive multiple antiviral drugs in addition to TDF,13,23,31,32 HBV-infected pregnant women usually use TDF as monotherapy during late pregnancy to prevent maternal transmission.14–17

Longer treatment duration and possible confounding factors, such as use of other antiviral drugs, co-morbidities, and diverse study participants from different sites/countries may result in the difference in neonatal bone mineral content in the study of HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants.13

Our prospective longitudinal follow-up data show similar increasing BMD trends with age and comparable bone metabolism markers in both the TDF and control group of children aged 2–7 years.

The result is one of the first studies reporting the long-term outcome of bone development in children with and without fetal exposure to TDF for prevention of maternal HBV transmission.

PARAGRAPH

Another safety concern with TDF is nephrotoxicity.

TDF-related renal function impairment has been observed in patients with HIV33 and HBV11 infection.

The main target of nephrotoxicity appears to be the proximal renal tubule, leading to defective proximal tubular secretion (e.g. of creatinine) and reabsorption of several substances including phosphate.11

Previous studies reported changes in renal function after TDF treatment for a median duration ranging from 6 to 45 months.11,33

For prevention of mother-to-infant transmission of HBV, TDF is used during late pregnancy, usually less than 2 to 3 months.

Our previous study of TDF use to prevent maternal HBV transmission reported no difference in maternal serum creatinine levels at delivery, 1 month, and 6 months postpartum and no difference in infants' serum creatinine levels at 6 months of age.15

The present study demonstrated that prenatal exposure of TDF does not affect these children's long-term renal function.

PARAGRAPH

In this study, the duration of exposure to TDF is relatively short (8–12 weeks).

All the mothers received short-term antiviral treatment from the 3rd trimester of pregnancy to 1 month postpartum.

For women with indications for antiviral therapy before pregnancy or during pregnancy because of mother's own HBV disease activity, the continuing use of antiviral therapy, especially TDF throughout the whole pregnancy period is suggested by leading professional organizations.8,9,34

The latest safety data from the antiretroviral pregnancy registry show that 4,334 women had used TDF since the first trimester without increased rates of birth anomalies.35

With regard to women infected with HBV, because of small numbers of mothers receiving antiviral therapy since the first trimester, the real-world data or studies reporting the course and outcome of these mother-children pairs are lacking.

Further investigations are needed.

PARAGRAPH

There are limitations to this study.

First, this is a non-randomized study.

For a trial starting in 2011 when safety data on antiviral nucleos(t)ide analogues therapy in HBV-infected pregnant women were insufficient, it was not practically feasible to conduct a double-blinded, randomized trial in pregnant women.

We have minimized the bias to the least extent by recruiting individuals with comparable baseline characteristics in both groups.15

Second, not all individuals enrolled in the maternal TDF trial agreed to participate in this follow-up study.

Lastly, we did not perform early DXA measurement before 1 year of age.

Nevertheless, we consider the data on bone development and metabolism markers in children older than 2 years to be more representative of children's long-term growth and health.

PARAGRAPH

In conclusion, TDF is effective and safe when used to prevent mother-to-infant transmission of HBV during pregnancy.

We demonstrated that children with and without fetal exposure to TDF during late pregnancy had comparable long-term growth, renal function and bone development, assessed by serum bone metabolism markers and DXA scans, up to 6–7 years of age.

Our data provide important information for clinicians, highly viremic HBV-infected pregnant women and their families.

The results confirm long-term safety in children with fetal TDF exposure, support TDF use among pregnant HBV-infected women, and will contribute to global elimination of HBV infection.
