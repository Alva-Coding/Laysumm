ABSTRACT

TITLE

Generalized tonic–clonic seizures with post-ictal atrial fibrillation

PARAGRAPH

Convulsive seizures are known to cause severe cardiopulmonary changes and increased autonomic activity.

Limited reports describe peri-ictal cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (AF) with generalized tonic–clonic seizures (GTCS).

We present a unique case of a healthy 23-year-old male patient with new onset prolonged AF in the setting of new onset seizures, occurring on three independent occasions.

Over two years, our patient had multiple hospitalizations for seizures with an electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis of AF made on three different occasions, occurring during his post-ictal state (all within 30 min of seizure onset).

These seizures were never captured by electroencephalography (EEG) or witnessed by the medical staff, but were reported by family and/or reviewed on video provided by them.

After his first GTCS, his AF persisted and was medically cardioverted.

Two additional instances of AF after witnessed GTCS have been captured.

After his second unprovoked seizure, an anti-seizure drug (ASD) was prescribed.

A multi-disciplinary approach may be adopted to address comorbidities associated with seizures.

Aggressive evaluation and treatment should be employed for newly diagnosed and refractory seizure patients associated with arrhythmias, in our case AF.

Peri-ictal arrhythmias may be considered a potential marker for increased sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) risk.
