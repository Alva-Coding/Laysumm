ABSTRACT

TITLE

NRF2 activates growth factor genes and downstream AKT signaling to induce mouse and human hepatomegaly

PARAGRAPH

Hepatomegaly can be triggered by insulin and insulin-unrelated etiologies.

Insulin acts via AKT, but how other challenges cause hepatomegaly is unknown.

PARAGRAPH

Since many hepatomegaly-inducing toxicants and stressors activate NRF2, we examined the effect of NRF2 activation on liver size and metabolism using a conditional allele encoding a constitutively active NRF2 variant to generate Nrf2Act-hep mice in which NRF2 is selectively activated in hepatocytes.

We also used adenoviruses encoding variants of the autophagy adaptor p62/SQSTM1, which activates liver NRF2, as well as liver-specific ATG7-deficient mice (Atg7Î”hep) and liver specimens from patients with hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (HSOS) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH).

RNA sequencing and cell signaling analyses were used to determine cellular consequences of NRF2 activation and diverse histological analyses were used to study effects of the different manipulations on liver and systemic pathophysiology.

PARAGRAPH

Hepatocyte-specific NRF2 activation, due to p62 accumulation or inhibition of KEAP1 binding, led to hepatomegaly associated with enhanced glycogenosis, steatosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest, fostering hyperplasia without cell division.

Surprisingly, all manipulations that led to NRF2 activation also activated AKT, whose inhibition blocked NRF2-induced hepatomegaly and glycogenosis, but not NRF2-dependent antioxidant gene induction.

AKT activation was linked to NRF2-mediated transcriptional induction of PDGF and EGF receptor ligands that signaled through their cognate receptors in an autocrine manner.

Insulin and insulin-like growth factors were not involved.

The NRF2-AKT signaling axis was also activated in human HSOS- and AIH-related hepatomegaly.

PARAGRAPH

NRF2, a transcription factor readily activated by xenobiotics, oxidative stress and autophagy disruptors, may be a common mediator of hepatomegaly; its effects on hepatic metabolism can be reversed by AKT/tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
