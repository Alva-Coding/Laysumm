TITLE

Streamlining radioembolization in UNOS T1/T2 hepatocellular carcinoma by eliminating lung shunt estimation

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Transarterial radioembolization with yttrium-90 (TARE) is a minimally invasive treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).1

In brief, TARE involves injecting radiated microspheres into hypervascular lesions.

While indications include small to infiltrative tumors with vascular invasion, this technique may be limited by extrahepatic deposition and elevated lung shunt fraction (LSF).

In recent years, TARE use in early disease (United Network for Organ Sharing [UNOS] T1/T2) for bridging/transplantation has increased, providing cohort and randomized data demonstrating prolonged time-to-progression, complete pathological necrosis, curative potential, and long survival outcomes.2–4

This has led to TARE being adopted as the arterial HCC therapy of choice at certain centers.5

As part of normal pathophysiology, HCC vascularity results in arteriovenous shunts that bypass capillaries and flow directly to the lung.6,7

Hence, there is a theoretical risk that microspheres could induce radiation pneumonitis (RP).

PARAGRAPH

The current standard for TARE involves arteriography with technetium-99 m macroaggregated albumin (MAA) 1-3 weeks prior to treatment.1

This helps: i) identify non-target deposition and, ii) quantify LSF.

LSF is then incorporated in dose calculation to ensure the risk of RP is mitigated.

However, this step results in an added procedure, increases cost, and delays time-to-treatment.

In this study, we present data supporting the proposal that a subgroup of patients with early stage HCC (UNOS T1/T2/Milan) exhibit clinically negligible LSF, and that there is sufficient rationale to eliminate this step from treatment algorithms and routine clinical practice.

We believe this would decrease time-to-treatment, lower costs, increase patient safety by minimizing unnecessary procedures, and facilitate treatment for patients traveling long distances.

SECTION

Patients and methods

PARAGRAPH

In this institutional review board approved study, we reviewed our prospectively acquired database on 1,175 patients with HCC treated with TARE between January 2004 and December 2018.

This time period was selected in order to ensure sufficient follow-up (>1 year) that would permit clinical observation of RP.

Inclusion criteria were early stage HCC UNOS T1/T2 (Milan Criteria: solitary tumor ≤5 cm, 2 or 3 lesions, all ≤3 cm).

Patients who had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B, portal vein invasion, or extrahepatic metastases were excluded.

SECTION

Evaluation and staging

PARAGRAPH

Diagnosis of HCC was made according to accepted guidelines.8,9

Patients were deemed TARE candidates after discussion by a multidisciplinary tumor board, including hepatology, medical oncology, transplant surgery and interventional radiology.

Once the decision to proceed with TARE was made, patients underwent planning angiography with MAA scanning, followed by treatment within 2 weeks according to conventional protocol.

Some patients underwent mapping angiography, LSF analysis, embolization and treatment using the same-day paradigm.10

SECTION

Pre-treatment angiography

PARAGRAPH

Under conscious sedation and continuous physiologic monitoring, planning angiography was performed.

Two millicuries of 99mTc-MAA was administered within the hepatic artery.11

While coil embolization of extrahepatic arteries was performed when necessary, this is contemporarily performed in fewer cases given distal/segmental infusions in T1/T2 disease, as well as confirmation of non-target perfusion by angiography (2004–2007) and subsequently cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT) once it became available (2007–2018).12,13

SECTION

Nuclear medicine scan

PARAGRAPH

Patients initially underwent planar scintigraphy followed by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT) as the procedure and imaging equipment evolved.10,14

SPECT/CT reconstructed images were evaluated for extrahepatic perfusion, and LSF was estimated by quantifying pulmonary radionuclide uptake from the planar images.

SECTION

Y90 infusion

PARAGRAPH

TARE (TheraSphere, Boston Scientific) planned dose to the treatment volume was estimated using the medical internal radiation dose (MIRD) dosimetry model for all cases (lobar/segmental) where D (Gy) = A (GBq) × 50 / M (kg) [D: Dose in Gray, A: Activity in Gigabecquerels, M: mass (in kilograms) of perfused liver tissue containing tumor].15

For radiation segmentectomy, a dose of >190 Gy delivered segmentally has been found to result in complete lesional necrosis.13

In patients with early HCC, lobar TARE was not commonly performed, and reserved only if segmental infusion(s) showed incomplete tumor perfusion (coverage).13,16

Also rarely, multiple vessels were noted to perfuse a segment bearing a tumor.

In such cases, the perfused volumes were proportionately divided and activity for each vessel determined accordingly.

For bilobar cases, multiple radiation segmentectomies usually performed, with corresponding dosimetry.

Lung dose was determined using the following formula: D (Gy) = 50 × Administered Activity (GBq) × LSF / Lung Mass (kg), with single treatment limit of 30 Gy to whole lungs.

SECTION

Clinical and imaging follow-up

PARAGRAPH

Patients were scheduled for 1-month clinical/imaging follow-up, and subsequently at 3-month intervals until transplant, resection or recurrence of new disease.

SECTION

Statistical analysis

PARAGRAPH

Data are presented as mean, median and range.

LSF values were stratified by baseline characteristics, and means were compared by independent sample t test for 2-level variables, and ANOVA for multi-level (>2 level) variables.

In order to identify LSF outliers, the Tukey (Tukey's Fences) method was used according to the definition: >1.5 ∗ IQR + 3rd quartile.17

To estimate the association between independent baseline parameters and LSF >10%, univariate logistic regression analyses were performed (n = 448).

Odds ratio of association of each independent variable and LSF >10% based on binary logistic regression models was determined.

Multivariate analysis was not performed due to: i) only 1 significant parameter on univariate analysis and, ii) too few observations of LSF >10%.

To confirm the observation of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) being the only parameter associated with LSF >10%, the univariate analysis was repeated in the patients without TIPS (n = 410).

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, Version 26.0.

Results

SECTION

Baseline characteristics

PARAGRAPH

A total of 448 patients with HCC and T1/T2 tumors were treated with TARE between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2018 (Table 1).

Mean age was 65.6 years, 303 (68%) were males, 225 (50%) had HCV while 37 (8%), 56 (12%), 58 (13%) and 72 (16%) had HBV, alcoholic disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and other etiologies (e.g. hemochromatosis, alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency and cryptogenic HCC), respectively.

A total of 352 (79%) had solitary lesions, while 96 (21%) exhibited multifocal disease.

Fifty-five (12%) had T1 disease, the remaining 393 (88%) were T2.

Mean tumor size was 2.7 cm (range: 1–5) and 406 (91%) had unilobar disease.

A total of 243 (54%) patients were Child-Pugh class A, 178 (40%) class B, and 27 (6%) class C.

The majority of patients (413 [92%]) were treatment naïve, with 8% previously exposed to resection, ablation or chemoembolization, while 38 patients (8%) had TIPS in place.

SECTION

MAA findings and Y90 treatment(s)

PARAGRAPH

Extrahepatic deposition by MAA scanning was noted in the following vascular territories: falciform (n = 22; 5%), gall bladder (n = 11; 2.5%), stomach (n = 9; 2%) and lymph node (n = 1, 0%).

In our early experience (2004–2007), we coil embolized 10/30 (33%) patients; this rate decreased to 33/418 (8%) with the advent of CBCT.

Sites of embolization included gastroduodenal, falciform, right gastric and accessory gastric arteries.

Of 448 patients, 398 (89%) underwent segmental TARE infusions, while the remainder (50/448; 11%) underwent lobar treatments.

Ninety-two patients received a second TARE treatment (36 as part of staged treatment, 56 for progressive disease/recurrence).

SECTION

Administered activity/lung shunt fraction

PARAGRAPH

Activity vials were used in the 448 patients (n = 574; 1.3 vials/patient).

The activity vials used, decayed to date of treatment, included 3 (n = 149; 26%), 5 (n = 157; 27%), 7 (n = 75; 13%), 10 (n = 85; 15%), 15 (n = 27; 5%) and 20 GBq (n = 18; 3%); the remainder were custom dosages (n = 63; 11%).

Mean and median administered activity were 1.1 and 0.9 GBq (range: 0.9–4.6), respectively.

Mean lung dose was 2.6 Gy, median 1.9 Gy (range: 0.1–17.5).

Mean and median LSF were 5.0% and 3.9% (range: 0.2–45%), respectively.

One patient with very high LSF had an arterioportal fistula from prior biopsy.

The LSF ranges were further stratified by group by LSF zones (≤5%, 5–10%, 10.1–15%, 15.1–20%, 20.1–25%, 25.1–30%, ≥30%) (Table 2).

The Tukey method identified outliers as LSF ≥11.5% (Fig. 1).

Table S1 lists the baseline characteristics of 20 patients with outliers LSF values ≥11.5%.

Table 3 lists the baseline characteristics matched to LSF.

Median LSF was 3.8% (IQR: 2.4–5.7%) and 6% (IQR: 3.8–15.3%) in no-TIPS vs. TIPS patients (p <0.001).

Median LSF was also found to be significantly lower in patients with Child Pugh A (p = 0.001), albumin >3.5 g/dl (p = 0.001), and bilirubin <2 g/dl (p = 0.001).

On univariate analysis, the presence of TIPS was associated with LSF >10% (p <0.001) (Table 4).

Further univariate analyses of 410 patients without TIPS pre-Y90 showed no association between any other baseline characteristic and an LSF >10% (Table S2).

Clinical outcomes

PARAGRAPH

RP was not observed in any case, including outliers.

Eleven of 20 (55%) outliers were transplanted without complication.

SECTION

Proposed model for MAA elimination

PARAGRAPH

Fig. 2 demonstrates the observed data in the 448-patient cohort, as well as the subset of patients that could be treated safely without knowledge of LSF.

The outer, larger shaded area demonstrates all 448 patients, with their respective LSF and lung doses.

All fall well within the lung safety limit of 30 Gy.

However, if we exclude patients receiving TIPS (higher likelihood of LSF >10%), a smaller, more homogeneous patient population (n = 410) is identified that could also be safely treated without knowledge of LSF, given that it is low in this group.

Also illustrated in Fig. 2 are potential lung doses assuming the typical 0.18 kg of perfused liver tissue T1/T2 patients would receive if prescribed 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 or 600 Gy.

Furthermore, the linear plots demonstrate that if a worst-case scenario of 18.1% LSF (largest value observed in entire no-TIPS cohort) was made, up to 600 Gy (ablative dose) or greater could safely be prescribed without risk of lung injury.

In the 600 Gy scenario, lung dose would be 19.5 Gy, well below the single session limit of 30 Gy.

Stated differently, the maximum activity (GBq) that could be infused assuming the maximum lung dose of 30 Gy is 3.31 GBq.

Correlating this to our 448-patient cohort, this would translate to treatment day administered segmental dose of 303 Gy if the highest segment size (530 cm3; 0.546 kg) or 2,669 Gy if the smallest segment size (60 cm3; 0.062 kg) is measured on CBCT.

Since dosing in T1/T2 HCC is rarely based on maximum lung dose given inherently low LSF, these numbers are never achieved.

In reality, since >90% LSF in T1/T2 HCC is <10%, actual tissue doses of 250–500 Gy are observed in practical settings.

SECTION

Discussion

PARAGRAPH

Since the introduction of TARE, hepatic arterial infusion of MAA has been the standard method used to estimate LSF.

While large, infiltrative tumors with vascular invasion frequently exhibit lung shunting, this is not the case with smaller tumors.18,19

The advent of TARE radiation segmentectomy and bridge to liver transplantation has brought into question the utility of the LSF in small, focal disease.13,20

This stems from the observation that, unlike large HCCs, smaller lesions do not exhibit microvascular arteriovenous shunting and hence pose little to no pulmonary risk.21,22

The purpose of our analysis is to introduce a simple but potentially significant change in the normal treatment algorithm for patients receiving TARE: we propose that the LSF shunting study in non-TIPS UNOS T1/T2 lesions be eliminated.

We hereby provide the rationale.

PARAGRAPH

First, our subset analysis of nearly 1,200 patients with HCC treated over 15 years identified 448 T1/T2 patients.

As part of normal TARE workup and treatment, no patient exhibited an LSF >45% (arterioportal fistula), and no lung dose exceeded 17.5 Gy.

Since the presence of TIPS was associated with LSF >10%, eliminating this confounding variable from further analyses yielded a homogenous sample of 410 patients.

Using 0.18 kg as a liver perfused mass, a maximum observed LSF of 18.1%, a dose up to 600 Gy could be prescribed without risk of lung toxicity.

Since most volumes and actual LSF are much lower, these assumptions provide significant safety margin for patients.

PARAGRAPH

Second, while it is often assumed that MAA injection is performed in order to determine LSF, it may also be used to assess for non-target deposition.

However, this is not the case with segmentectomy used in T1/T2 disease.

Segmental TARE injections are performed distal to the lobar vessels, well beyond the typical origins of extrahepatic arteries that may flow to the gastrointestinal tract.16,23

Furthermore, the gold standard methodology for assessing non-target flow and accurate placement of TARE has now become CBCT.24

Historically, prior to the advent of CBCT, there was a greater need for conservative approaches, including coil embolization of potential non-target vessels.

While it is not being suggested that CBCT is essential for the no-MAA paradigm, most angiography suites now support this technique, and its use is strongly recommended if implementation of this paradigm is being considered.

PARAGRAPH

Third, while knowledge of the differential flow between tumor and normal parenchyma is instrumental in deriving a tumor-to-normal parenchyma ratio used in multicompartment dosimetry, this is not needed for radiation segmentectomy.25,26

A recent international consensus group has recently recommended the use of single compartment dosimetry when distal, segmental treatments are planned (MIRD).

Single compartment dosimetry does not involve MAA or LSF; inclusion of the latter 2 is reserved for lobar infusions.27

PARAGRAPH

Fourth, this model permits some tissue mass variability that is unique to each patient.

Since our study is reporting observed liver mass of up to 0.55 kg, keeping the prior assumptions yields sustained ablative dosimetry.

As an example, if 600 Gy was prescribed to a 0.18 kg mass of perfused tissue containing tumor, an actual mass of 0.55 kg would still achieve an ablative dose of 198 Gy.

The safety is further supplemented by the fact that the 30 Gy lung limit is an extremely conservative estimate of dose limit based on external beam radiotherapy, not TARE.6,28,29

PARAGRAPH

Finally, the rationale for eliminating the MAA/LSF study relates to cost and number of procedures.30

In contradistinction to other embolotherapies (bland, chemoembolization) where 3-4 procedures are routinely performed, most T1/T2 patients usually require only 1 treatment of TARE.2

However, routine treatment algorithms include an extra angiogram to assess LSF; this may be difficult for patients residing a long distance from the treatment center.

Given that LSF is not relevant, the specific patient population of T1/T2 could benefit from eliminating this step.

The resultant effect is expedited patient treatment, fewer procedures performed, shortened time-to-treatment and decreased overall costs.30,31

Effectively, the TARE algorithm would become similar to non-TARE embolotherapies, where patients are promptly scheduled for treatment without the requisite planning angiogram, with the added advantage of a single, outpatient, same-day treatment of TARE.

The cost benefit of fewer procedures with TARE compared to other therapies that could be considered in this patient population has been described.30

PARAGRAPH

Limitations of this analysis include the retrospective nature.

The analysis does, however, address an important issue: that of a potentially unnecessary angiogram in select T1/T2 patients.

While there have been other studies that looked at LSF in advanced disease, this is the first to focus on early HCC.18,19

The sample size is large, and the proposed “no-MAA” patient population is clear and well-defined (UNOS T1/T2 + no-TIPS + planned radiation segmentectomy); T1/T2 patients with TIPS still require an MAA/LSF study.

Because MAA breaks down into smaller particles and flows to the lung, the LSF is widely recognized to be higher than actual.

Given that most T1/T2 lesions have an LSF of <10%, the error rate of actual dose given ranges by that amount, well within accepted dosimetry standards.

Less experienced centers should also be able to implement this paradigm, since: a) LSF in this homogeneous cohort becomes mathematically insignificant and, b) CBCT is implemented at most centers.

Eliminating an angiogram may save on costs, increase patient safety by reducing a procedure, accelerate patient treatment and permit “same-day” technique, a major paradigm shift.10,32

In fact, when only 1 vessel is perfusing the tumor, the procedure is simplified to the “1-hour Y90”, defined as (micro)catheter access to the lesion and segmental infusion of TARE in T1/T2 patients; this can be performed routinely by most interventional centers in 60 min or less.

It is also possible that, given the potential for multiple tumor vessels for larger UNOS T2 lesions, ordering >1 vials of glass microspheres in advance may be necessary to ensure full tumor coverage; this is at times currently performed for radiation segmentectomy.

This approach is only a recommendation; physicians may still opt to perform planning angiography in this subset of patients as the clinical scenario dictates.

Finally, implementing this new approach in T1/T2 HCC will require the data to be presented to ethics committees and regulatory bodies, ultimately leading to a modification of the device (package) insert.

SECTION

Conclusion

PARAGRAPH

Patients with UNOS T1/T2 HCC without TIPS being treated with TARE do not require the planning mapping angiogram and LSF.

This decision should not only be based on tumor stage and absence of TIPS, but also on selectivity of treatment (segmental, subsegmental) and intent (radiation segmentectomy).

CBCT is strongly advocated to exclude extrahepatic deposition, confirm complete tumor coverage, and assist in determining the actual administered dose, particularly when multiple feeders are identified.

Ablative doses up to 600 Gy, achieving complete pathological necrosis, can be safely prescribed without risk of RP.

Implementing this concept would result in a significant and positive paradigm shift in the TARE treatment algorithm for patients with HCC.
