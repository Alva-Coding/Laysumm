ABSTRACT

TITLE

Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy mimic associated with CHD2 gene mutation

PARAGRAPH

This paper reports the electroclinical manifestations of an epilepsy syndrome associated with a chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 2 (CHD2) gene mutation with clinical semiology and electroencephalographic (EEG) features consistent with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME).

Myoclonic and myoclonic-tonic–clonic seizures, as well as generalized 4- to 5-Hz high-amplitude spike–wave and polyspike–wave discharges, were well characterized in an adolescent.

However, the atypical age of onset, developmental disability, and apparent drug resistance led to suspicion of an alternative etiology for epilepsy, subsequently verified as a CHD2 gene mutation.

When atypical features are present, a JME mimic should be suspected in the differential diagnosis of the more established syndrome of JME.
