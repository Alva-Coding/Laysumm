Artificial hydrocarbon networks (AHN) – a supervised learning method inspired on organic chemical structures and mechanisms – have shown improvements in predictive power and interpretability in comparison with other well-known machine learning models. However, AHN are very time-consuming that are not able to deal with large data until now. In this paper, we introduce the stochastic parallel extreme artificial hydrocarbon networks (SPE-AHN), an algorithm for fast and robust training of supervised AHN models in high-dimensional data. This training method comprises a population-based meta-heuristic optimization with defined individual encoding and objective function related to the AHN-model, an implementation in parallel-computing, and a stochastic learning approach for consuming large data. We conducted three experiments with synthetic and real data sets to validate the training execution time and performance of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed SPE-AHN outperforms the original-AHN method, increasing the speed of training more than 10,000x times in the worst case scenario. Additionally, we present two case studies in real data sets for solar-panel deployment prediction (regression problem), and human falls and daily activities classification in healthcare monitoring systems (classification problem). These case studies showed that SPE-AHN improves the state-of-the-art machine learning models in both engineering problems. We anticipate our new training algorithm to be useful in many applications of AHN like robotics, finance, medical engineering, aerospace, and others, in which large amounts of data (e.g. big data) is essential. Machine learning is continuously releasing its power in a wide range of applications. Large and big data paradigms allow these algorithms to make more accurate and timely predictions; but it carries a cost that involves challenges in model scalability and distributed computing. Moreover, machine learning and data mining tasks in big data includes different nature of inputs that typically exhibit high dimensionality, e.g. more than 1000 features, far from current acceptable scales computing in a single machine (Bekkerman, 2012). This work proposed a stochastic parallel extreme artificial hydrocarbon networks, an algorithm for fast and robust training of supervised AHN models in high-dimensional data. The proposed training algorithm comprised of three key components: a generalized inverse implementation for learning parameters in molecules, parallel-computing based on PSO for near optimal convergence of centers of molecules, and stochastic learning approach for consuming large data.
Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis, the most recognized type of autoimmune encephalitis, manifests with rapid cognitive decline, psychosis, and seizures that develop in 78–86% of patients. Recently, anti-NMDAR encephalitis was reported in association with demyelinating diseases which are accompanied by a characteristic clinical phenotype, imaging abnormalities, and the presence of antibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG-IgG) in bodily fluids. The patient presented herein suffered from bilateral optic neuritis followed by recurrent encephalitis with focal seizures and demonstrated anti-NMDAR and MOG-IgGs in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum, respectively. Her symptoms responded to immunotherapy and antiseizure medication. The recognition of the novel syndrome of MOG antibody-associated demyelination (MOGAD), encompassing the overlapping anti-NMDAR encephalitis and other MOG-IgG associated disorders, is important for the successful management of these patients. Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis, an immune-mediated encephalopathy, has been recently reported in association with central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating diseases including acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) [1], myelitis [2] and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) [3]. A demyelinating disease can manifest along with anti-NMDAR encephalitis or occur at a distant time [3]. In a recent case series of 691 patients with serologically confirmed anti-NMDAR encephalitis, an antecedent or subsequent episode consistent with NMO spectrum disorder was identified in 12 patients, all of whom had demyelinating or multifocal hemispheric or brainstem lesions [3]. The understanding of the interplay between the adaptive immune system and processes contributing to central demyelination is evolving. We report a patient with an isolated optic neuritis that preceded the manifestation of autoimmune encephalitis and seizure onset by several months. The long-lasting remission of symptoms in both conditions was achieved with immunotherapies. We report a rare case of recurrent unilateral alternating cerebral cortical encephalitis associated with MOG antibodies which presented with encephalopathy and seizures and was preceded by optic neuritis. In contrast to the previous findings that MOGAD in patients with overlapping syndrome are more difficult to treat than anti-NMDAR encephalitis, our patient recovered from both demyelinating and autoimmune diseases without any residual deficits. Based on the limited number of case reports of this syndrome, its diagnosis may be challenging, and prognosis for future relapses remains unknown.
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an artificial intelligence technique used to solve Markov and semi-Markov decision processes. Actor critics form a major class of RL algorithms that suffer from a critical deficiency, which is that the values of the so-called actor in these algorithms can become very large causing computer overflow. In practice, hence, one has to artificially constrain these values, via a projection, and at times further use temperature-reduction tuning parameters in the popular Boltzmann action-selection schemes to make the algorithm deliver acceptable results. This artificial bounding and temperature reduction, however, do not allow for full exploration of the state space, which often leads to sub-optimal solutions on large-scale problems. We propose a new actor–critic algorithm in which (i) the actor’s values remain bounded without any projection and (ii) no temperature-reduction tuning parameter is needed. The algorithm also represents a significant improvement over a recent version in the literature, where although the values remain bounded they usually become very large in magnitude, necessitating the use of a temperature-reduction parameter. Our new algorithm is tested on an important problem in an area of management science known as airline revenue management, where the state-space is very large. The algorithm delivers encouraging computational behavior, outperforming a well-known industrial heuristic called EMSR-b on industrial data. Reinforcement Learning or RL (see Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis (1996), Sutton and Barto (1998), Gosavi (2014b) and Szepesvári (2010)) is used to solve problems in which an agent selects optimal actions in an unknown stochastic environment via repeated trials and errors. In every trial, the agent gathers feedback from the environment and uses the feedback to update its knowledge base. Typically, after a large number of trials and errors in its interactions, the agent learns to select an optimal action in every state. The Markov Decision Process or Problem (MDP) and the semi-MDP (SMDP) (Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1996) have been extensively used as the underlying models in the above-described RL domain. Essentially, in the MDP model, the underlying system dynamics and behavior are governed by Markov chains. Further, in an MDP, the time taken in a one-step transition from any state to any other is assumed to be the same. The SMDP is a more general model in which this transition time is assumed to be a random variable whose distribution is known. While the actor–critic algorithm predates the more popular Q-Learning algorithm, one drawback of the actor–critic that has perhaps prevented its applications in large-scale problems is the unboundedness of the actor’s values. There are two significant difficulties associated to the unboundedness: (i) the values can become too large in magnitude causing a computer overflow and (ii) the large values usually cause insufficient exploration of the state space when used in conjunction with the popular Boltzmann action-selection scheme. Two mechanisms suggested in the literature to circumvent these difficulties are: (i) an awkward projection that forces the values to be bounded and (ii) a temperature-reduction scheme; unfortunately, both of these mechanisms can still lead to poor solutions due to the insufficient exploration that they deliver. A key contribution of this paper was to develop a new update in which the actor’s iterates were not only bounded, but also remained small in magnitude without any artificial projection or temperature reduction; further it should be noted that this led to a superior exploration of the state space.
This work deals with the application of archaeological methods and modern methodologies of point clouds survey to structural analysis, with the purpose of creating a series of products, such as Elevation Maps, Orthophotos, 3D Models, in order to highlight the building and mechanical past of the examined buildings and to further the knowledge of the territory's seismic history. These products are to be used as a base for the study of the cognitive process of the material structure, the constructive techniques and the restoration of a specific context, of importance for future vulnerability and restoration analyses. The present paper will focus on the trinomial “technology-archaeoseismology-earthquakes” in order to bring to the attention of the scientific community the advantages and critical issues of an innovative point of view. The historical center of Florence and, specifically, the church of San Remigio, has been chosen as a case study to illustrate the methodology. In a vast, heterogenous and averagely seismic landscape like the Italian one, characterized by a significant presence of historical edifices that require safeguarding, the recent issuing by the MiBAC of the “Linee Guida per la valutazione e riduzione del rischio sismico del patrimonio culturale allineate alle nuove Norme tecniche per le costruzioni (d.m. 14 gennaio 2008) (Mibac, 2011)” has attempted to regulate interventions in the field of architecture (Pugi and Galassi, 2013; Paradiso et al., 2014a). This paper specifically outlines the need of a multidisciplinary approach towards the study of past monuments, achieved from the interaction of analyses conducted by different disciplines related to the fields of the sciences and the humanities. In this panorama, the systematic use of archaeoseismic research applied to historical buildings in broad territorial districts (Arrighetti, 2015, 2016) has produced new groundbreaking data obtained through archaeological methods and tools that are in themselves perfectly integrable with data provided by other disciplines (e.g. historical seismology, structural engineering, earth sciences, restoration, etc.). In a preliminary stage of investigation, the operational praxis developed for the analysis of such contexts has considered that specific attention should be given to the study of seismologic databases and seismic maps. This is followed, in the operational phase, by the integration of archaeological data and macro-features reading (Doglioni et al., 1994; Doglioni, 2003; Doglioni and Mazzotti, 2007) along with the documented evidence and analysis of disruptions and restorations, consequently leading to a stratigraphic “breakdown” and interpretation of the constructive history and mechanics of the buildings. Archaeoseismology provides the opportunity to retrace the architectural development of single edifices, reconstructing their “seismic history” – intended as the complex of different construction/destruction phenomena closely related to historical earthquakes that took place in the area and that affected the edifices structurally – and successively connecting it to the entire study context. In addition, the identification and characterization of disruptions, repair work or reconstructions, integrated with the stratigraphic analysis of the edifices, provides valuable information on the relative and absolute chronologies of such events. Furthermore, once the traces of collapse and restoration are proved as evidence of past earthquakes (unless caused by other natural and/or anthropic factors), it is in some cases possible to suggest both the presence and intensity of catastrophic events still unknown to other documental sources – such as the seismic catalogues – and to have a better understanding of how an edifice reacted to a specific earthquake. The possibility to precisely characterize single disruptions and chronologically locate them by way of stratigraphic analysis and historical sources offers an in-depth knowledge of the buildings fabric as well as their constructive and mechanic history. This information is of fundamental importance for vulnerability assessments and the planning of restoration and strengthening works (Paradiso et al., 2013; Sinicropi et al., 2014; Galassi, 2018a, 2018b). It is therefore important to understand which multidisciplinary methods and techniques must absolutely co-exist and work in synergy, and more importantly, be directed by trained personnel with the required skills and competencies. Only through the ability to employ the necessary technologies and methods at a high level is it possible to answer both historical and technical questions while justifying more wide-ranging reflections.
We describe an adolescent girl with non-paraneoplastic anti-NMDA-receptor encephalitis (ANMDARE), who despite persistence of the extreme delta brush (EDB) pattern for nearly 2 years in her serial EEGs, she exhibited a speedy and sustained response to immunotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, our patient had the longest persistence of the EDB pattern on EEG reported to date. Our patient illustrates that, although presence of EDB supports the diagnosis of ANMDARE, its presence and persistence may not be a reliable predictor of response to immunotherapy and overall clinical prognosis. The red circle depicts the functional deficit zone over the left parietal lobe at or close to angular gyrus. Serial EEGs show left hemispheric polymorphic slow activity, maximally over the centro-parietal region, along with EDB. The montages for all EEGs are as magnified in the box.Unlabelled Image Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis (ANMDARE) is a disorder presenting with subacute onset of seizures, psychosis, memory and language deficits, abnormal movements, and breathing and autonomic disturbances [1,2]. Although initially identified in association with ovarian teratomas, in a majority of children and young adults, ANMDARE occurs without tumors [2]. Three-fourths of patients with ANMDARE make substantial recovery with early diagnosis, tumor resection and immunotherapy, but relapses may occur in a quarter of them [1]. 
This article presents the second study of ochres associated with the Lower Magdalenian (18.7 cal kya) “Red Lady” human burial in El Mirón Cave (Cantabria, Spain). In the first study (Seva Román et al., 2015), we determined that the burial deposit contained iron oxides and idiomorphic hematite that were not from sources near the site, but possibly from Monte Buciero, some 27 km to the north on the present Atlantic shore in Santoña. We have now analyzed sediments both from the burial and from samples taken during prospection on Monte Buciero, along with ochres from deposits above the burial layer, from the face of a large limestone block immediately adjacent to the burial, and from an area of the cave wall close to it in the NE corner of the cave vestibule that bears the engraving of a horse. As before, the analyses used were binocular microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDX) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). We were thus able to determine that the sources of the ochres in the burial deposit and on the block are the same—Monte Buciero. However we found substantial differences between the ochre on the block and the ochre underlying the horse panel image on the cave wall, which very likely also dates to sometime in the Magdalenian. The instrumental analysis of ochres has provided important information on the various uses of these mineral oxides in prehistory (e.g., García Borja et al., 2004; Bersani and Lottici, 2016; Eiselt et al., 2011; Marshall et al., 2005; Mooney et al., 2003; Popelka et al., 2007, 2008, 2016; Rifkin et al., 2016; Ferrier et al., 2017), including Upper Paleolithic cave painting (Clottes et al., 1990a, 1990b; Hernanz et al., 2010, 2012; Hernanz, 2015; Iriarte et al., 2009, 2017; Seva Román et al., 2015), and possible use by Neanderthals (Zilhão, 2001; Zilhão et al., 2010; D'Errico et al., 1998, 2010; Hovers et al., 2003; Roebroeks et al., 2012). The arguably symbolic use of red ochre has been documented from archeological sites in Africa, the Near East and Europe dating as early as the Acheulean and Middle Paleolithic/Middle Stone Age, and may be a fundamentally common characteristic of genus Homo (e.g., Wreschner, 1980; Watts, 2002; Hovers et al., 2003). Based on these results we can make the following conclusions: The ochre used in the Red Lady burial was brought from Monte Buciero, in Santoña, about 27 km from El Mirón Cave. In order to paint the eastern face of the block in the area contiguous with the burial, people utilized the same ochre as in the burial, but with the addition of microfragments of bone together presumably with some (non-detected) agglutinant, such as animal or vegetal fat. The ochre utilized in the pigment on the cave wall adjacent to the horse image was made of goethite which was heated and pounded, thus producing a redder tone and an extremely fine granulometry. Triturated bone was not utilized in this paint. It is an iron oxide that is very abundant in the vicinity of the cave in the upper Asón and tributary Carranza valleys, which we also prospected and sampled. The ochres utilized in the upper strata (501 y 503), are of a completely different nature and are geologically more similar to the iron oxide outcrops in the above-mentioned valleys, with the appearance of siderite. In its elaboration, as in its granulometry and composition, the paint on the block is completely different from the pigment adjacent to the engraved horse image on the cave wall.
We report a child with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome with an increase in seizure frequency and loss of psychomotor skills due to a disintegrated cervical VNS lead, not detected during standard device monitoring. The lead was completely removed and replaced by a new 303 lead on the same nerve segment. After reinitiating VNS, side effects forced us to switch it off, resulting in immediate seizure recurrence. EEG recording demonstrated a non-convulsive status epilepticus that was halted by reinitiating VNS therapy. Thereafter, he remained seizure free for eight months, and regained psychomotor development. Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is one of the most challenging epilepsies to manage, due to a range of different seizure types which are frequently refractory to anti-seizure drug treatment. In patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, treatment options other than anti-seizure drugs are often considered; including epilepsy surgery, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy and a ketogenic diet. VNS therapy in our patient was associated with cessation of status epilepticus, seizure freedom, and restored psychomotor function. System assessment during programming the VNS may not always detect lead dysfunction which should therefore be considered if seizure recurrence and loss of psychomotor skills occur in previously effective VNS therapy without any alternative explanation. In our case of LGS with 8 months of follow-up, we found that complete VNS revision (lead removal and subsequent replacement) if performed in patients using newer models sensing heart rate correctly may yield excellent results without clinically relevant side effects.
Following the 14th century depopulation of the Savannah River Valley of modern Georgia and South Carolina, the neighboring coastal region of Georgia exhibited significant changes in settlement. In the absence of other demographic proxies, Georgia state site file data show that there was a greater accumulation of archaeological components during the 14th century than in any other preceding period. Exploratory Bayesian modeling of settlement practices using a compiled set of legacy radiocarbon dates demonstrates that much of this expansion of settlement happened concomitant with the depopulation of the Savannah River Valley. Climatic instability is one of the greatest natural challenges facing human groups. Drought, in particular, has been a major stressor of subsistence and sociopolitical systems. Droughts vary in geographic and temporal scale, sometimes intermittent and local, and occasionally decadal and regional. Human responses to drought vary in kind. For example, in the American Southwest, a significant disruption in normal rainfall patterns between 1250 CE and 1450 led to the abandonment of the Kayenta and Greater Mesa Verde regions (Cameron, 1995; Dean and Funkhouser, 1995; Hill et al., 2004; Lekson and Cameron, 1995; Mills et al., 2015). Decades of study have shown that these two cases of abandonment and migration led to very different social outcomes for both migrants and locals based on the cultural and environmental contexts of their respective homelands and destinations (Clark and Lyons, 2012; Mills, 2011; Ortman, 2012; Ortman et al., 2014; Stone, 2015). Following abandonment of the major mound centers of the Middle Savannah River Valley, circa cal. 1380 CE, and the almost complete abandonment of the region by 1450 CE, available evidence suggests that the Georgia Coast received some number of immigrants. Based on rates of component accumulation, quantification of settlement continuity, and Bayesian chronological modeling of settlement behavior, the latter half of 14th century and beginning of the 15th was a time of significant change on the Georgia Coast. During this period, my analyses suggest that the number of occupied sites increased by 50%, almost certainly due to migration of people from the Savannah River Valley to the Georgia Coast. In addition to instigating rapid changes in settlement practice, these migrants may have also contributed to other cultural changes along the Georgia coast, including the adoption, or proliferation, of new stylistic motifs (Moore, 1897; Saunders, 2017), as well as the introduction of maize agriculture (Larsen et al., 2002; Thomas, 2008a) and new political systems (Saunders, 2017; Thompson, 2009).
A 21-year-old male with an SCN1A mutation died of cerebral herniation 3 h after a seizure occurring during physical activity. Cases of fatal cerebral edema in patients with SCN1A mutations after fever and status epilepticus have been recently reported raising the question whether sodium channel dysfunction may contribute to cerebral edema and thereby contribute to the increased premature mortality in Dravet Syndrome. We report on our patient and discuss whether the combination of hyperthermia and ion channel dysfunction may not only trigger seizures but also a fatal pathophysiological cascade of cerebral edema and herniation leading to cardiorespiratory collapse. Patients with Dravet Syndrome (DS) are at a significantly increased risk for premature death (16–17 per 1000 patient years), with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) representing the leading cause of death in childhood followed by status epilepticus [1,2]. Despite sporadic reports of acute encephalopathy in DS, cerebral edema is not traditionally considered a key pathological mechanism contributing to high mortality in DS. Recently Myers et al. report 5 fatal cases of cerebral edema occurring days after status epilepticus in children with DS. We were recently confronted with a similar case in our emergency department (ED). This was remarkable because our DS patient experienced fatal transtentorial herniation within three hours of a generalized convulsive seizure despite being immediately aborted with buccal midazolam. We therefore find it relevant to report on this case and bring to attention that there may be circumstances under which fatal cerebral edema develops rapidly in patients with DS. Cytotoxic brain edema, neuronal swelling and subsequently Ca2 +-independent neuronal death are mediated by a sodium ion influx into neurons, which peaks during the repetitive firing of neurons underlying seizures. It is therefore possible that sodium channel dysfunction can promote fatal cerebral edema under certain circumstances including the post-ictal period. The combination of hyperthermia, ion channel dysfunction and possibly emotional stress may therefore not only trigger seizures but also facilitate a fatal pathophysiological cascade of cerebral edema leading to cerebral herniation causing cardiorespiratory collapse. Furthermore, SCN1A mutations may alter susceptibility for neuronal hypoxia. Further analyses are required to elucidate underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of SUDEP and post-ictal edema in DS patients.
Ninety years ago in the Zagros foothills of Iraq, Dorothy Garrod and her team excavated Zarzi cave, the type site of the Epipalaeolithic “Zarzian” lithic industry. Garrod reported the existence of “two small fragments of obsidian” in the principally chert-based microlithic assemblage. One of the two artifacts from Zarzi was analyzed by Renfrew and colleagues in a pioneering application of obsidian sourcing to the Near East, which elucidated links between Neolithic villages. It was, unfortunately, ambiguously assigned to their “Group 4c” obsidian, which occurs at two different sources, ∼120 km apart, in eastern Turkey. New interpretive methods — agent-based models, least-cost path analysis, and others — have been applied to the datasets of Renfrew and colleagues, furthering work on the mechanisms of Neolithicization. With respect to the Epipalaeolithic, though, all of these studies rely entirely on this single Zarzi artifact with an inconclusive attribution. Fortunately, the second Zarzi obsidian “fragment” — a burin spall — was “rediscovered” at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard. Our study establishes that both artifacts came from Nemrut Dağ volcano, 400 km linearly and ≳650 km on foot. To do so, multivariate analyses were applied to the original spectroscopic data of Renfrew and colleagues, while state-of-the-art portable XRF was used to source the burin spall at Harvard's Peabody Museum. Comparison to two Epipalaeolithic sites in the Caucasus begins to reveal a patchwork of interaction spheres that highlight not only the potential of obsidian sourcing but also the considerable amount of work yet to be done. In the Mesopotamian highlands, the Epipalaeolithic (EP) — that is, the portion of the Upper Palaeolithic that falls between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 26.5 to ∼20 ka) and the start of the Neolithic (12 ka) — is a crucial period for investigating the rise of food production, sedentism, and other aspects of the so-called “Neolithic package.” This timeframe is even considered “Period 0” in the Atlas des Sites du Proche-Orient (ASPO) chronological scheme, devised by the Maison de l'Orient et de la Méditerranée, as a means to conceptualize the rise of Neolithic phenomena that culminated in urbanism (Hours et al., 1994; Aurenche et al., 2001). A variety of stimuli have been proposed for this “revolution” that appears, at least, to coincide with the beginning of the Holocene (∼11.65 ka). Braidwood's (1951) “hilly flanks” hypothesis posited that agriculture and sedentism arose in the foothills of the Taurus and Zagros mountain ranges, where fertile land enabled grain gathering and which coincided with the natural habitats for the wild forms of domesticates. Binford (1968) and Flannery (1969), in response to Braidwood, held that demographic pressures drove a shift to food production. Hayden (1992) suggested that feasting and other opulent displays drove agriculture. Individuals who could amass a food surplus were able to transform it into, for example, exotic and desirable objects, facilitating the rise of social inequality. Price and Bar-Yosef (2011) point out that each of these scenarios is “very much a chicken-egg question, like the issue of population pressure, of which came first” (S167). There is, though, an increasing recognition that certain aspects of the “Neolithic” package may have emerged at different times and places during the EP (e.g., Akkermans, 2004; Watkins, 2010; Weide et al., 2018). Consequently, “Period 0” is an important time in which to seek archaeological evidence that can be contrasted against Neolithic datasets. 
Geological and archaeological analysis of stone masonries in standing structures helps reveal information about use of natural resources. At the same time, the study of historical materials is useful for conservators and cultural heritage management. Geochemical and petrographic analysis of building material types is usually done through destructive analysis on a few selected samples and can be problematic due to the costs of operations and the size of buildings themselves. This paper demonstrates that the combination of hyperspectral imaging portable Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (ED-XRF) spectroscopy can be useful for analysing types of raw materials used in distinct construction phases of the inner defensive wall in the citadel of Carcassonne (Aude, France). Stratigraphic analysis of the architecture, short-range spectral remote sensing and portable ED-XRF measurements were combined in an interdisciplinary approach to classify sandstone elements. The experimental protocol for in situ non-destructive analysis and classification of the masonry types allows the investigation of the monument in a diachronic perspective, collecting information to delineate raw materials varieties and their use or re-use through time. A global project The instruments used for the study provided interesting results and granted good accuracy. Probes such as portable NIR and portable ED-XRF allow collection of fast point measurements and can be carried by one person. The recordings can be multiplied to guarantee a good coverage of samples, and the data matrices can be statistically merged to enhance the information. The combination of MicroNIR and ED-XRF can be used as a screening method for classification of lithic materials in various field situations but does not guarantee a very detailed mineralogical characterization. The imaging system is less portable but results in a more complex datasets, encompassing chemical information and its spatial variability, highlighting the complexity of the materials' surfaces. The imaging system can be moved around an object, but have height limits. Considering this issue, we envisage associating the NEO HySpex camera with drone imaging in order to reach higher portions of the building.
We present a unique case of a patient with drug-resistant focal epilepsy undergoing stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) who developed an acute posttraumatic intracranial hemorrhage during monitoring, first detected by changes on sEEG. Our case demonstrates the evolution of electrographic changes at the time of initial hemorrhage to the development of ictal activity. We conducted spectral analysis of the sEEG data to illustrate the transition from an interictal to ictal state. Initially, delta power increased in the region of acute hemorrhage, followed by sustained regional reduction in frequency variability. Our findings provide further information on the development of epileptiform activity in acute hemorrhage. Traumatic brain hemorrhage (TBH) can be associated with lifelong functional, cognitive and emotional impairment. The magnitude of tissue damage following trauma is determined by both the primary injury, which is dependent on the kinetic energy at the time of impact, and the secondary injury that accumulates over time due to the response of the brain tissue surrounding the primary injury site [1]. Among different factors that contribute to secondary injury are seizures and hemorrhagic progression of contusion (HPC) [2]. HPC can present as progressive hemorrhagic injury or as delayed intracerebral hematoma 48 h after the trauma. HPC may result in increased seizure burden, although it is unclear if seizures and HPC are corelated or occur independent of each other. Growing evidence suggests that epileptiform transients and seizures are independent predictors of the development of chronic spontaneous seizures (posttraumatic epilepsy; PTE) [3,4]. Therefore, the management of TBH includes monitoring and treatment of HPC and the development of new-onset seizures. Capitalizing on a traumatic HPC following a seizure-related head injury in a patient with drug-resistant focal epilepsy admitted for sEEG monitoring, we demonstrate the temporal evolution of epileptiform activity and the associated spectrographic changes that were localized adjacent to the area of acute hemorrhage. The hemorrhage was noted to be outside of and contralateral to the area eventually determined to be the seizure onset zone (SOZ). In this study, we document the electrographic changes in the human brain in response to acute traumatic brain hemorrhage as detected by sEEG electrodes. We hypothesize that the hemorrhage described in this case was multifactorial. It is likely that the violent tonic head movements noted during seizure five caused significant shear stress in the right frontal brain regions. While this scenario would not normally cause hemorrhage, shear strain in the area of the affected implanted electrode likely resulted in small vessel damage adjacent to the electrode. Our findings reinforce prior studies showing that acute intracranial hemorrhage can result in new-onset epileptiform activity that can be present despite the absence of neurological deficits. This may have implications regarding prophylactic anti-seizure drug therapy and extension of intracranial monitoring of perilesional brain tissue in cases of hemorrhage where otherwise small focal seizures would not be left unnoticed and untreated based on current evidence from clinical practice [10]. Patients with epilepsy are prone to traumatic falls that can produce TBI and intracranial hemorrhage. This case study highlights that in patients with epilepsy, a TBH can provoke seizures in regions outside the putative SOZ, and that new epileptiform activity in areas outside of the suspected SOZ should raise the suspicion for the interval development of a second lesion including intracranial hemorrhage. Moreover, seizures resulting in head trauma over the course of invasive EEG monitoring may increase the risk of acute posttraumatic hemorrhage.
Newly emerging location-based social network (LBSN) services provide us with new platforms to share interests and individual experience based on their activity history. The problems of data sparsity and user distrust in LBSNs create a severe challenge for traditional recommender systems. Moreover, users’ behaviors in LBSNs show an obvious spatio-temporal pattern. Valuable extra information from microblog-based social networks (MBSNs) can be utilized to improve the effectiveness of POI suggestion. In this study, we propose a latent probabilistic generative model called MTAS, which can accurately capture the underlying information in users’ words extracted from both LBSNs and MBSNs by taking into consideration the decision probability, a latent variable indicating a user’s tendency to publish a review in LBSNs or MBSNs. Then, the parameters of the MTAS model can be inferred by the Gibbs sampling method in an effective manner. Based on MTAS, we design an effective framework to fulfill the top-k suggestion. Extensive experiments on two real geo-social networks show that MTAS achieves better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods. Recent years have witnessed a blooming of Web 2.0, positioning systems and wireless communication technologies. Location based social networks (LBSNs), such as Foursquare2  and Yelp3  have become a popular application and facilitated users’ daily life. People can expand circles of friends, share their real experience and post reviews, photos and videos. As a significant tool of LBSNs, suggestion methods learn users’ preferences from their historical records and meta-data such as social relationship and review content, then suggest underlying points-of-interest (POIs) to the specific users. POI suggestion can benefit advertising agencies with an effective way of launching advertisements to the potential consumers, and improve user viscosity to LBSN service providers as well (Zhao et al., 2016a). POI Suggestion is a very challenging and difficult task in LBSNs. The data sparsity and user distrust in the LBSNs create a severe challenge for traditional recommender systems. Additionally, users’ behaviors in a LBSN show an obvious spatio-temporal pattern. In order to effectively recommend POIs in LBSNs, we integrate the factors including cross-platform textual content, temporal effect, social communities and geographical regions. Then, we propose a latent probabilistic generative model called MTAS, which can accurately capture users’ words in both LBSNs and MBSNs by taking into consideration posting decision probability, a latent variable indicating a user’s tendency to publish a review in LBSNs or MBSNs, which have different distribution w.r.t. topics and words. In particular, the parameters of the MTAS model can be inferred by the Gibbs sampling method in an effective fashion. Beyond these proposed techniques, we introduce an POI suggestion framework based on MTAS. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on two real geo-social networks. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MTAS on effective and efficient POI suggestion in both home-town and out-of-town scenarios, when compared with the state-of-the-art baseline approaches.
Duplication of the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) is a rare condition that results in epilepsy in half of the cases. Although this condition has been well characterized in the literature, there is a lack of research on MECP2 duplication-related epilepsy and its management. We present the case of an eleven-year old male with MECP2 duplication and epilepsy, who was resistant to polytherapy. The patient responded well to valproic acid (VPA) initially and upon re-challenge. This case report provides evidence for the use of VPA as an initial monotherapy for treatment of drug-resistant MECP2 duplication-related epilepsy. Duplications of Xq28 involving the methyl CpG binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) causes 0.5 to 2% of X-linked developmental disabilities and are predominantly inherited with full penetrance in males [1]. More severe mutations in MECP2 are lethal in males. Females with point mutations in MECP2 present with Rett syndrome. MECP2 duplication syndrome has been well-described in patients with mental retardation, absent to minimal speech, hypotonia replaced by progressive spasticity and/or ataxia, mild facial dysmorphisms (brachycephaly, large face, midface hypoplasia, depressed nasal bridge, upturned nares), severe recurrent respiratory infections, and in some cases, death before 25 years of age [2]. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of drug-resistant MECP2 duplication related epilepsy, showing responsiveness to VPA both initially and upon a re-challenge, strongly supporting the efficacy of this anticonvulsant as a monotherapy. The case highlights the benefits of VPA in targeting the generalized seizure types and EEG activity seen in MECP2 duplication syndrome. It also suggests that side effects of VPA such as thrombocytopenia can be mitigated by a dose reduction and re-challenge with close monitoring of laboratory markers. Although most cases in the literature suggest that epilepsy associated with MECP2 duplication syndrome is treatment-resistant, we provide contrasting evidence that there may be a role for VPA as a monotherapy in achieving seizure control in some patients.
Multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) typically assumes that crowds make completely rational decisions. In MCDM, a crowd as a whole, or its individual members, generally make decisions free from any influence of valence, arousal, emotional state or environment. In contrast, various theories dealing with crowd psychology (Gustave Le Bon, Freudian, Deindividuation, Convergence, Emergent norm, Social identity) analyze, in one form or another, the emotions of the crowd. According to above theories, crowd is influenced by a range of behavioral factors, such as physical, social, psychological, culture, norms, and emotions. It can be argued that the emotional state, valence and arousal of crowds affect their decision making to a considerable degree and multiple criteria crowd behavior modeling must, therefore, consider this impact as well. In this light, the integration of crowd simulation and biometric methods, behavioral operations research and emotions in decision making has taken a prominent place as it leads to a better understanding of crowd emotions and crowd decision making. In this context, the authors developed the Affective Analytics of Demonstration Sites (ANDES) that added to this body of research in four ways. The crowd analysis and simulations conducted with ANDES used a neuro decision matrix. The matrix contains a detailed description of demonstration sites (public spaces) in question and the emotions, valence, arousal and physiological parameters of people present there. With ANDES’s Remote Sensor Network, emotional (emotions, valence, arousal) and physiological (average crowd facial temperature, crowd composition by gender and age group, etc.) parameters of people present at demonstration sites can be mapped. ANDES can assist experts in more effective implementations of public spaces planning and a participation process by attendees by collecting and examining various layers of data on the emotional and physiological parameters of visitors based on a visitors-centric public spaces planning approach. ANDES can determine the public space and real estate values. Both scholars and practitioners have been attempting over the past century to evaluate the emotions of residents quantitatively. Such data was meant for practical applications when executing important events and exhibitions and when planning public spaces and cities. For example, Saroff and Levitan (1969) use opinion surveys and sampling methods in the urban planning process. They have analyzed various quantitative and qualitative data, while paying special attention to human emotions. The techniques, technologies and systems for planners during these times were mostly limited to questionnaires, interviews and the like, but there were no tools for analyzing emotions in an urban setting and public spaces (Zeile et al., 2015, 2016). Throughout the development of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, technologies emerged for applying remote biometrics and physiological measures of emotions at events, exhibitions and public spaces in real time. Nonetheless, to date, the use of remote biometrics and physiological systems is rare. These emerged biometrics technologies could support studies on the human emotions and people’s physiological states found in the public spaces along with human circadian rhythm, weather conditions, pollution in a combined way. Then applications of such data along with information and mining outcomes could serve as additional knowledge for the planning objectives of events, exhibitions and public spaces. Such is the purpose of this research involved in developing the Affective Analytics of Demonstration Sites (ANDES). 
This work examines the carbon and nitrogen composition of human and animal collagen from the Roman necropolis of Lucus Feroniae (Rome, 1st–3rd century AD) and the Longobard cemetery of La Selvicciola in northern Latium (Viterbo, 7th century AD), with a special focus on possible dietary variations at the transition between classical and post-classical times. A substantial isotopic difference between the two series reveals distinct dietary practices at the two sites, especially the consumption of cereals and contribution of other foodstuffs to a mainly grain-based diet. We argue that such differences are explained through the social and cultural background of the two populations examined, where the isotopic variance of the Roman data is in line with that of a group of heterogeneous origin and varied dietary practices, while the tight clustering of isotopic signatures for the Longobard people reflects the foodways of a homogeneous group. Intra-site variation shows no significant difference according to the sex of the deceased. Outlying individuals might be explained through cultural practices that call for further insight. Isotopic data have shown to successfully reflect social and cultural phenomena of human groups in a changing world, in a way that other archaeological proxies have sometimes failed to achieve. There are no isotopic works in Europe focusing on the transition from classical to post-classical times. While most isotopic studies concentrate either on the first period (Chenery et al. 2010; Fuller et al. 2006; Prowse et al. 2005; Prowse et al. 2004) or the latter (Bourbou et al. 2011; Hakenbeck et al. 2010; Müldner and Richards 2005; Reitsema et al. 2010; Richards et al. 2006) a diachronic perspective is still lacking. However, the transition to the post-classical times is one of important changes, which involved a shift in social and economic aspects of everyday life for most populations in the western world. Health status and life conditions changed dramatically and human groups faced periods of instability that, among other aspects, are also testified in population replacement (Amorim et al. 2018). In Italy, in particular, with the fall of the Western Roman Empire (476 CE), the Gothic war and the following Byzantine domination, the contribution of Longobard migration to the Peninsula had a profound impact on the cultural as well as genetic background of the Italian people (Melucco Vaccaro, 1988; Rotili 2010). 
Obsidian was an important resource for prehistoric people in the North American Southwest. Elemental analysis of obsidian samples from Southwestern archaeological sites has been widely successful in identifying the raw material sources used by the people in the region. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is the most commonly used method for sourcing obsidian artifacts because it is a rapid, non-destructive analytical technique with high discriminating ability. In this study, we analyzed over 450 pieces of obsidian from several Sinagua sites near Flagstaff, AZ. Obsidian debitage and unfinished points are common on these sites. The majority of points, and almost all the debitage, are from Government Mountain, the expected primary source. A few other sources have a minor presence, and it is likely that any points made of obsidian from these sources reached the sites as completed arrowheads, rather than being made there. Our limited data from survey finds and early points on late sites suggest that the pre-Sinagua Archaic populations were more mobile and used a wider variety of stone sources. Identification of obsidian sources through chemical characterization has been a productive avenue of archaeological research for some 50 years. In the American Southwest, prominent obsidian sources were exploited over the whole span of regional prehistory, and their products widely spread. Our archaeological projects in northern Arizona focus on the prehistoric culture known as the Sinagua, who occupied a zone of cultural contacts not far from heavily-exploited obsidian sources. In sourcing a large number of obsidian artifacts from our sites, we hoped to see patterns of change through time and reflections of the Sinaguas' place in regional systems of exchange and cultural contact, as previous work in the region has suggested (Brown, 1991; Horn-Wilson, 1997; Rondeau, 1979; Shackley, 2005). Rather than travel large distances or engage in long-distance exchange for obsidian, the Sinagua exploited the closest sources, especially the plentiful and good quality obsidian at the Government Mountain source, the closest to our sites. They also used the RS Hill source, a neighboring source in the San Francisco Volcanic Field, to a lesser extent because it was more difficult to collect obsidian at this source. Sinagua relations with the Cohonina, the archaeological culture around the obsidian sources, are currently not well understood. They probably changed through time, but as far as we can tell, the supply of obsidian and the sources used did not change greatly.
Archaeological materials in museum collections provide an excellent opportunity for researchers to investigate social, cultural, and environmental change. However, the precision of the archaeological analysis and interpretation is dependent on a firm understanding of the site chronology. The Par-Tee site (35CLT20), located on the northern Oregon Coast, produced a large archaeological collection including artifacts and faunal remains excavated in the 1960s and 1970s. Radiocarbon dates have been obtained on materials from the Par-Tee collections by several different researchers since the 1970s, but these data have not been adequately assessed for chronometric hygiene. To establish a reliable chronology for the Par-Tee site, we obtained new high-resolution accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates and collagen peptide mass fingerprinting of cervid bones from throughout the site. We evaluate these new radiocarbon dates along with previous radiocarbon dates from the site, using chronometric hygiene assessments and Bayesian statistics to build a refined chronology for the Par-Tee site and museum collection. Previous research suggests site habitation occurred between 350 cal BC to cal AD 1150. Our reassessment of the site chronology suggests the primary site habitation occurred from cal AD ~100–800. We also identified evidence of subsequent site occupation around cal AD ~1490–1635 supporting previous interpretations of site habitation after the primary shell midden forming occupation. The latter occupation may be associated with a change in site use from a semi-sedentary village to a cemetery. Museum-based archaeological research offers access to unique archaeological materials sometimes unobtainable through modern studies—a result of the often large-scale of late-nineteenth and early twentieth-century excavations. Although concerns of decreasing museum repository space are increasing (Bawaya, 2007), anthropological research of museum collections is addressing a diverse range of anthropological, biological, and conservation issues (Sholts et al., 2016). Collections-based studies, however, can be complicated by the differential excavation, recovery, and curation histories of museum collections (Bawaya, 2007; Pearce, 1994). As Luby et al. (2013) note, these early museum assemblages endure as legacy collections rather than as “old” excavation materials. The term legacy highlights the inherent value and the importance of museum collections from the perspective of stewardship, research, and education. Our 14C dating of the Par-Tee museum specimens suggests that archaeologists should interpret historically reported 14C dates with caution, especially those derived from composite samples of charcoal, bone, and shell and unidentified charcoal samples. In addition, our findings highlight the value of reanalyzing legacy collections with improved dating techniques. Although there appears to be more intensive use of the Par-Tee site between cal AD ~400–650, the majority of the Par-Tee site collection is best viewed as the result of a single long-term ~700–800 year occupation.
A large amount of well-preserved timbers was found during several archaeological excavations of the Faravel mining site (Southern French Alps, between 1950- and 2150 m a.s.l.). 232 of these timbers were sampled for dendrochronological analysis and 67% of them were dated. These 156 larch (Larix decidua Mill.) series, crossdated against existing reference chronologies, were averaged for a site chronology spanning from 777 to 1243. From this dataset, 33 timbers with (almost) complete sapwood allowed us to obtain tree felling years with seasonal resolution. The chronological distribution of these felling years highlights nine distinct mining phases that occurred between 1059 and 1243, revealing a discontinuous exploitation of the study site during the medieval period. In addition, the presence of late wood in the vast majority of complete samples, demonstrates that logging mainly occurred during late fall and early winter. These results, combined with historical, palynological and archaeological investigations, plead for short, seasonal, and low-intensity, mining campaigns, mainly carried out after the bulk of agropastoral activities using rudimentary techniques with limited impact on the forest cover. Medieval wood is frequently perfectly preserved and abundant (Bailly-Maître, 2008a; Tegel, 2012). At that time, wood was required for carpentry works and manufacturing equipment (floors, ladders, hoists, dragging roads, timbered shafts etc.). Mines are generally closed environments saturated with humidity and protected from light and temperature variations. Therefore, wood does not decompose as fast as it would in open-air, particularly when it is located in submerged and/or backfilled works. Numerous pieces of preserved wood have allowed dendrochronologists to build reliable and powerful cross-dated site chronologies for dating and for revealing phases of mining activity. Moreover, wood analyses can provide information about how species were selected for different uses, the mechanical properties and qualities of the selected wood, and forest management. In addition, tool traces may provide information about the tools and techniques used by miners for tree felling, debarking, limb removal, length reduction, and shaping. Consequently, dendrochronological analyses of mining sites are of high interest not only to dendrochronologists but also to archaeologists and historians. The dendrochronological analysis of this unusual amount of timber material from the Fangeas mine provided new knowledge on mining rhythmicity and human practices over a three-century period.
Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived liver modeling systems have the potential to overcome the shortage of donors for clinical application and become a model for drug development. Although several strategies are available to generate hepatic micro-tissues, few have succeeded in generating a liver organoid with hepatobiliary structure from hiPSCs. At differentiation stages I and II (day 1–15), 25% of mTeSR™ culture medium was added to hepatic differentiation medium to induce endodermal and mesodermal commitment and thereafter hepatic and biliary co-differentiation. At stage III (day 15–45), 10% cholesterol+ MIX was added to the maturation medium to promote the formation and maturation of the hepatobiliary organoids. Phenotypes and functions of organoids were determined by specific markers and multiple functional assays both in vitro and in vivo. In this system, hiPSCs were induced to form 3D hepatobiliary organoids and to some extent recapitulated key aspects of early hepatogenesis in a parallel fashion. The organoids displayed a series of functional attributes. Specifically, the induced hepatocyte-like cells could take up indocyanine green, accumulate lipid and glycogen, and displayed appropriate secretion ability (albumin and urea) and drug metabolic ability (CYP3A4 activity and inducibility); the biliary structures in the system showed gamma glutamyltransferase activity and the ability to efflux rhodamine and store bile acids. Furthermore, after transplantation into the immune-deficient mice, the organoids survived for more than 8 weeks. This is the first time that functional hepatobiliary organoids have been generated from hiPSCs. The organoid model will be useful for in vitro studies of the molecular mechanisms of liver development and has important potential in the therapy of liver diseases. To date, most of the pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-based liver modeling systems have initiated differentiation from highly purified definitive endoderm (DE) and have generated monolayer hepatocyte-like cells.1–5 However, preclinical predictions from such models are usually difficult to interpret, and may be misleading, because homogeneous DE populations are insufficient to accurately replicate the complex regulation of signals among cells and tissues during liver organogenesis.6 A recent study, which mimicked liver development by combining hepatic endoderm cells with endothelial cells and mesenchymal progenitors, resulted in the generation of a liver bud-like structure with improved function.7 Similarly, co-culture of fetal liver progenitor cells and liver extracellular matrix triggered the formation of hepatocytes with bile duct-like structures.8 These findings highlighted the importance of multicellular interactions during early liver development. However, these studies combined cells that were isolated from multiple and postnatal individuals, suggesting a severe limitation of the transplanting applications based on these strategies. 
Terbinafine is an antifungal agent that has been associated with rare instances of hepatotoxicity. In this study we aimed to describe the presenting features and outcomes of patients with terbinafine hepatotoxicity and to investigate the role of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*33:01. Consecutive high causality cases of terbinafine hepatotoxicity enrolled into the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network were reviewed. DNA samples underwent high-resolution confirmatory HLA sequencing using the Ilumina MiSeq platform. All 15 patients with terbinafine hepatotoxicity were more than 40 years old (median = 57 years), 53% were female and the median latency to onset was 38 days (range 24 to 114 days). At the onset of drug-induced liver injury, 80% were jaundiced, median serum alanine aminotransferase was 448 U/L and alkaline phosphatase was 333 U/L. One individual required liver transplantation for acute liver failure during follow-up, and 7 of the 13 (54%) remaining individuals had ongoing liver injury at 6 months, with 4 demonstrating persistently abnormal liver biochemistries at month 24. High-resolution HLA genotyping confirmed that 10 of the 11 (91%) European ancestry participants were carriers of the HLA-A*33:01, B*14:02, C*08:02 haplotype, which has a carrier frequency of 1.6% in European Ancestry population controls. One African American patient was also an HLA-A*33:01 carrier while 2 East Asian patients were carriers of a similar HLA type: A*33:03. Molecular docking studies indicated that terbinafine may interact with HLA-A*33:01 and A*33:03. Patients with terbinafine hepatotoxicity most commonly present with a mixed or cholestatic liver injury profile and frequently have residual evidence of chronic cholestatic injury. A strong genetic association of HLA-A*33:01 with terbinafine drug-induced liver injury was confirmed amongst Caucasians. Terbinafine is an orally administered antifungal agent that is commonly used to treat superficial fungal infections of the skin and nails. It was approved for use in the United States in 1998 and is typically given in an oral dose of 250 mg daily for 6 to 12 weeks. Terbinafine use is associated with mild liver biochemistry abnormalities in <1% of treated patients. However, the incidence of clinically significant liver injury attributed to terbinafine is not known because of a lack of sensitive and reliable means to detect hepatotoxicity in a prospective, population-based cohort. The liver injury may be hepatocellular at initial presentation but usually evolves into a cholestatic profile over time.1 United States Hypersensitivity and autoimmune features are uncommon and some studies suggest that a reactive metabolite may be involved that can accumulate in the bile.2 In addition, rare instances of severe hepatitis, acute liver failure and fatalities have been described with terbinafine use.3,4 
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an idiopathic, chronic cholestatic liver disorder characterized by biliary inflammation and fibrosis. Increased numbers of intrahepatic interferon-γ- (IFNγ) producing lymphocytes have been documented in patients with PSC, yet their functional role remains to be determined. Liver tissue samples were collected from patients with PSC. The contribution of lymphocytes to liver pathology was assessed in Mdr2−/− x Rag1−/− mice, which lack T and B cells, and following depletion of CD90.2+ or natural killer (NK)p46+ cells in Mdr2−/− mice. Liver pathology was also determined in Mdr2−/− x Ifng−/− mice and following anti-IFNγ antibody treatment of Mdr2−/− mice. Immune cell composition was analysed by multi-colour flow cytometry. Liver injury and fibrosis were determined by standard assays. Patients with PSC showed increased IFNγ serum levels and elevated numbers of hepatic CD56bright NK cells. In Mdr2−/− mice, hepatic CD8+ T cells and NK cells were the primary source of IFNγ. Depletion of CD90.2+ cells reduced hepatic Ifng expression, NK cell cytotoxicity and liver injury similar to Mdr2−/− x Rag1−/− mice. Depletion of NK cells resulted in reduced CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity and liver fibrosis. The complete absence of IFNγ in Mdr2−/−x Ifng−/− mice reduced NK cell and CD8+ T cell frequencies expressing the cytotoxic effector molecules granzyme B and TRAIL and prevented liver fibrosis. The antifibrotic effect of IFNγ was also observed upon antibody-dependent neutralisation in Mdr2−/− mice. IFNγ changed the phenotype of hepatic CD8+ T cells and NK cells towards increased cytotoxicity and its absence attenuated liver fibrosis in chronic sclerosing cholangitis. Therefore, unravelling the immunopathogenesis of PSC with a particular focus on IFNγ might help to develop novel treatment options. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a poorly understood chronic progressive biliary disease of unknown aetiology, characterized by biliary inflammation and fibrosis, development of cholestasis, end-stage liver disease and a high risk of malignancy. Approximately 60% of patients with PSC are male and 70 to 80% have inflammatory bowel disease. Both the incidence and prevalence of PSC are increasing, indicating that current medical treatment is poorly effective.1 
Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is a transcription factor mediating antiviral responses, yet recent evidence indicates that IRF3 also has critical non-transcriptional functions, including activating RIG-I-like receptors-induced IRF-3-mediated pathway of apoptosis (RIPA) and restricting activity of NF-κB. Using a novel murine model expressing only non-transcriptional IRF3 activity (Irf3S1/S1), we tested the hypothesis that non-transcriptional functions of IRF3 modulate innate immune responses in the Gao-binge (acute-on-chronic) model of alcohol-related liver disease. IRF3 and IRF3-mediated signals were analysed in liver samples from 5 patients transplanted for alcoholic hepatitis and 5 healthy controls. C57BL/6, Irf3−/− and Irf3S1/S1 mice were exposed to Gao-binge ethanol-induced liver injury. IRF3-mediated RIPA was investigated in cultured macrophages. Phospho-IRF3 and IRF3-mediated signals were elevated in livers of patients with alcoholic hepatitis. In C57BL/6 mice, Gao-binge ethanol exposure activated IRF3 signaling and resulted in hepatocellular injury. Indicators of liver injury were differentially impacted by Irf3 genotype. Irf3−/−, but not Irf3S1/S1, mice were protected from steatosis, elevated alanine/aspartate aminotransferase levels and inflammatory cytokine expression. In contrast, neutrophil accumulation and endoplasmic reticulum stress were independent of genotype. Protection from Gao-binge injury in Irf3−/− mice was associated with an increased ratio of Ly6Clow (restorative) to Ly6Chigh (inflammatory) cells compared to C57BL/6 and Irf3S1/S1 mice. Reduced ratios of Ly6Clow/Ly6Chigh in C57BL/6 and Irf3S1/S1 mice were associated with increased apoptosis in the Ly6Clow population in response to Gao-binge. Activation of primary macrophage cultures with Poly (I:C) induced translocation of IRF3 to the mitochondria, where it associated with Bax and activated caspases 3 and 9, processes indicative of activation of the RIPA pathway. Taken together, these data identify that the non-transcriptional function of IRF3 plays an important role in modulating the innate immune environment in response to Gao-binge ethanol exposure, via regulation of immune cell apoptosis. Alcohol consumption is a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality worldwide.1 The pathogenesis of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is initially characterized by steatosis, progressing in some individuals to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Alcoholic hepatitis (AH), a severe inflammatory condition, with extensive infiltration of leukocytes and hepatocellular injury, can occur at any stage of disease progression; 28-day mortality rates range from 25–35%.1–2 The development of AH is a complex process involving both parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells resident in the liver, as well as the recruitment of immune cells to the liver in response to damage and inflammation.3 Current therapies, focusing on suppressing inflammation, are ineffective in many patients with severe AH and outcomes remain poor.4 
The extrahepatic bile duct is the primary tissue initially affected by biliary atresia. Biliary atresia is a cholangiopathy which exclusively affects neonates. Current animal models suggest that the developing bile duct is uniquely susceptible to damage. In this study, we aimed to define the anatomical and functional differences between the neonatal and adult mouse extrahepatic bile ducts. We studied mouse passaged cholangiocytes, mouse BALB/c neonatal and adult primary cholangiocytes, as well as isolated extrahepatic bile ducts, and a collagen reporter mouse. The methods used included transmission electron microscopy, lectin staining, immunostaining, rhodamine uptake assays, bile acid toxicity assays, and in vitro modeling of the matrix. The cholangiocyte monolayer of the neonatal extrahepatic bile duct was immature, lacking the uniform apical glycocalyx and mature cell-cell junctions typical of adult cholangiocytes. Functional studies showed that the glycocalyx protected against bile acid injury and that neonatal cholangiocyte monolayers were more permeable than adult monolayers. In adult ducts, the submucosal space was filled with collagen I, elastin, hyaluronic acid, and proteoglycans. In contrast, the neonatal submucosa had little collagen I and elastin, although both increased rapidly after birth. In vitro modeling of the matrix suggested that the composition of the neonatal submucosa relative to the adult submucosa led to increased diffusion of bile. A Col-GFP reporter mouse showed that cells in the neonatal but not adult submucosa were actively producing collagen. We identified 4 key differences between the neonatal and adult extrahepatic bile duct. We showed that these features may have functional implications, suggesting the neonatal extrahepatic bile ducts are particularly susceptible to injury and fibrosis. Mammalian bile travels through an arborizing network, encompassing bile canaliculi, the canals of Hering and ductules, and cholangiocyte-lined intrahepatic (IHBD) and extrahepatic (EHBD) bile ducts. The IHBD and EHBD arise from different primordia: the cranial portion of the endodermal diverticulum gives rise to the liver and the IHBD, while the caudal portion develops into the EHBD.1–3 The EHBD and IHBD, in addition to differing in development, size, and surrounding tissue, are also notable for differential susceptibility to certain cholangiopathies including primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and the neonatal fibro-obliterative disease biliary atresia (BA). BA, which at the time of presentation primarily affects the EHBD, is specific to neonates, who are born apparently healthy but progress remarkably quickly (within several months) to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Recent human and animal model data suggest that the initial insult is prenatal, affecting the neonate but sparing the mother.4–8 This suggests a paradigm whereby the fetal and neonatal ducts, especially the EHBD, are uniquely susceptible to initial and progressive damage from injurious agents. 
Treatment programs for people who inject drugs (PWID), including prisoners, are important for achieving hepatitis C elimination targets. There are multiple barriers to treatment of hepatitis C in prisons, including access to specialist physicians, testing and antiviral therapy, short prison sentences, and frequent inter-prison transfer. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a nurse-led model of care for the treatment of prisoners with hepatitis C. A statewide program for assessment and management of hepatitis C was developed in Victoria, Australia to improve access to care for prisoners. This nurse-led model of care is supported by telemedicine to provide decentralized care within all prisons in the state. We prospectively evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of this nurse-led model of care for hepatitis C within the 14 adult prisons over a 13-month period. The primary endpoint was sustained virological response at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12) using per protocol analysis. There were 416 prisoners included in the analysis. The median age was 41 years, 90% were male, 50% had genotype 3 and 44% genotype 1 hepatitis C and 21% had cirrhosis. Injecting drug use was reported by 68% in the month prior to prison entry, 54% were receiving opioid substitution therapy, and 86% reported never previously engaging with specialist HCV care. Treatment duration was 8 weeks in 24%, 12 weeks in 59%, and 24 weeks in 17% of treatment courses. The SVR12 rate was 96% (301/313) per protocol. Inter-prison transfer occurred during 26% of treatment courses but was not associated with lower SVR12 rates. No treatment-related serious adverse events occurred. Hepatitis C treatment using a decentralized, nurse-led model of care is highly effective and can reach large numbers of prisoners. Large scale prison treatment programs should be considered to support hepatitis C elimination efforts. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set global targets for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat.1 For hepatitis C, the goals are to reduce incidence by 80% and mortality by 65% by 2030. In Western countries where injecting drug use is the dominant risk factor for hepatitis C transmission,2 eliminating incident infection will require coordinated efforts using harm reduction strategies as well as “treatment as prevention” to interrupt transmission among people who inject drugs (PWID). This population has not typically been well engaged with specialist care, highlighting the need to develop new models of care for hepatitis C among marginalized, high transmitting populations. In conclusion, DAA therapy for hepatitis C using a decentralized, nurse-led model of care was highly effective in increasing hepatitis C treatment access to a large population of prisoners, with high rates of hepatitis C cure.Given the high prevalence of hepatitis C among prisoners, with many reporting current or recent injecting drug use, large scale prison treatment programs should be promoted to benefit both the individual prisoner and also hepatitis C elimination efforts in the broader community.
The microenvironment regulates hepatoma stem cell behavior. However, the contributions of lymphatic endothelial cells to the hepatoma stem cell niche remain largely unknown; we aimed to analyze this contribution and elucidate the mechanisms behind it. Associations between lymphatic endothelial cells and CD133+ hepatoma stem cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence and adhesion assays; with the effects of their association on IL-17A expression examined using western blot, quantitative reverse transcription PCR and luciferase reporter assay. The effects of IL-17A on the self-renewal and tumorigenesis of hepatoma stem cells were examined using sphere and tumor formation assays. The role of IL-17A in immune escape by hepatoma stem cells was examined using flow cytometry. The expression of IL-17A in hepatoma tissues was examined using immunohistochemistry. CD133+ hepatoma stem cells preferentially interact with lymphatic endothelial cells. The interaction between the mannose receptor and high-mannose type N-glycans mediates the interaction between CD133+ hepatoma stem cells and lymphatic endothelial cells. This interaction activates cytokine IL-17A expression in lymphatic endothelial cells. IL-17A promotes the self-renewal of hepatoma stem cells. It also promotes their immune escape, partly through upregulation of PD-L1. Interactions between lymphatic endothelial cells and hepatoma stem cells promote the self-renewal and immune escape of hepatoma stem cells, by activating IL-17A signaling. Thus, inhibiting IL-17A signaling may be a promising approach for hepatoma treatment. Hepatoma stem cells are thought to be responsible for the initial development, progression and therapeutic resistance of hepatomas.1 For example, CD133+ hepatoma cells highly express stemness genes, possess multi-lineage differentiation capabilities and are highly tumorigenic in immunocompromised mice.2,3 Exploring the mechanisms behind the highly tumorigenic nature of hepatoma stem cells will contribute to the development of therapeutic approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major complication of hemorrhagic shock, liver resection and transplantation. YAP, a key downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, is essential for determining cell fate and maintaining homeostasis in the liver. We aimed to elucidate its role in IRI. The role of YAP/Hippo signaling was systematically studied in biopsy specimens from 60 patients after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), and in a mouse model of liver warm IRI. Human biopsy specimens were collected after 2–10 h of cold storage and 3 h post-reperfusion, before being screened by western blot. In the mouse model, the role of YAP was probed by activating or inhibiting YAP prior to ischemia-reperfusion. In human biopsies, high post-OLT YAP expression was correlated with well-preserved histology and improved hepatocellular function at postoperative day 1–7. In mice, the ischemia insult (90 min) triggered intrinsic hepatic YAP expression, which peaked at 1–6 h of reperfusion. Activation of YAP protected the liver against IR-stress, by promoting regenerative and anti-oxidative gene induction, while diminishing oxidative stress, necrosis/apoptosis and the innate inflammatory response. Inhibition of YAP aggravated hepatic IRI and suppressed repair/anti-oxidative genes. In mouse hepatocyte cultures, activating YAP prevented hypoxia-reoxygenation induced stress. Interestingly, YAP activation suppressed extracellular matrix synthesis and diminished hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, whereas YAP inhibition significantly delayed hepatic repair, potentiated HSC activation, and enhanced liver fibrosis at 7 days post-IRI. Notably, YAP activation failed to protect Nrf2-deficient livers against IR-mediated damage, leading to extensive fibrosis. Our novel findings document the crucial role of YAP in IR-mediated hepatocellular damage and liver fibrogenesis, providing evidence of a potential therapeutic target for the management of sterile liver inflammation in transplant recipients. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is considered the standard treatment for end-stage liver disease. Following organ retrieval, cold preservation and warm ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) can lead to impaired graft function, including primary graft non-function, which may predispose patients to acute and chronic rejection. Indeed, by contributing to a shortage of available donor organs, IRI represents one of the most challenging problems in transplantation.1–4 Thus, novel therapeutic concepts to combat IRI are needed to improve OLT outcomes and expand the donor organ pool. 
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder causing pulmonary and liver disease. The PiZ mutation in AAT (SERPINA1) results in mis-folded AAT protein (Z-AAT) accumulating in hepatocytes, leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis. RNAi-based therapeutics silencing production of hepatic Z-AAT might benefit patients with AATD-associated liver disease. This study evaluated an RNAi therapeutic to silence production of AAT. Part A of this double-blind first-in-human study randomized 54 healthy volunteers (HVs) into single dose cohorts (two placebo: four active), receiving escalating doses of the investigational agent ARC-AAT from 0.38 to 8.0 mg/kg or placebo. Part B randomized 11 patients with PiZZ (homozygous for Z-AAT) genotype AATD, who received up to 4.0 mg/kg of ARC-AAT or placebo. Patients with baseline FibroScan® >11 kPa or forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) <60% were excluded. Assessments included safety, pharmacokinetics, and change in serum AAT concentrations. A total of 36 HVs received ARC-AAT and 18 received placebo (part A). Seven PiZZ individuals received ARC-AAT and four received placebo (part B). A dose response in serum AAT reduction was observed at doses ≥4 mg/kg with similar relative reductions in PiZZ patients and HVs at 4 mg/kg and a maximum reduction of 76.1% (HVs) vs. 78.8% (PiZZ) at this dose. The time it took for serum AAT to return to baseline was similar for HV and PiZZ. There were no notable differences between HV and PiZZ safety parameters. The study was terminated early because of toxicity findings related to the delivery vehicle (ARC-EX1) seen in a non-human primate study. PiZZ patients and HVs responded similarly to ARC-AAT. Deep and durable knockdown of hepatic AAT production based on observed reduction in serum AAT concentrations was demonstrated. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an autosomal co-dominant disease which predisposes patients to early-onset emphysema and liver cirrhosis.1 Estimates of the number of adult patients with AATD exhibiting clinically significant liver disease have varied from 10% (defined by aminotransferase abnormalities)2,3 to 18% in a UK cohort assessed by ultrasound (+/− biopsy)4 to approximately 35% in those with an Ishak fibrosis score ≥2 assessed histologically after liver biopsy.5 A Swedish autopsy series from patients with AATD and the PiZZ genotype found liver disease to be present in the majority of patients, albeit unrecognized in many cases during life.6 In common with other causes of cirrhosis, many factors are thought to affect clinical presentation, including alcohol use,7 body mass index,8 gender9 and genetic modifiers. Liver disease shows a bimodal clinical presentation. Prolonged neonatal jaundice is common in newborns with the PiZZ genotype, with most recovering but others progressing to cirrhotic disease that requires transplantation at a young age.10,11 A second peak occurs in adults who can present with clinical liver disease that can also progress to cirrhosis and transplant, even in the absence of a childhood history of liver disease.3 No definitive methods to predict progression to cirrhosis exist at present in either the pediatric or adult populations. Current management of liver disease in AATD is largely supportive, with transplantation the only definitive treatment. In the U.S., AATD accounts for approximately 1.5% of liver transplants with ∼76 transplants performed annually12 with outcomes similar to other common indications for transplant.13 In conclusion, RNAi can be used to reduce hepatic production of AAT based on dose responsive reductions in serum AAT levels seen after administration of single doses of ARC-AA.siRNA shows promise for the treatment of AATD-associated liver disease.
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is one the most potent nucleot(s)ide analogues for treating chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Phenotypic resistance caused by genotypic resistance to TDF has not been reported. This study aimed to characterize HBV mutations that confer tenofovir resistance. Two patients with viral breakthrough during treatment with TDF-containing regimens were prospectively enrolled. The gene encoding HBV reverse transcriptase was sequenced. Eleven HBV clones harboring a series of mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. Drug susceptibility of each clone was determined by Southern blot analysis and real-time PCR. The relative frequency of mutants was evaluated by ultra-deep sequencing and clonal analysis. Five mutations (rtS106C [C], rtH126Y [Y], rtD134E [E], rtM204I/V, and rtL269I [I]) were commonly found in viral isolates from 2 patients. The novel mutations C, Y, and E were associated with drug resistance. In assays for drug susceptibility, the IC50 value for wild-type HBV was 3.8 ± 0.6 µM, whereas the IC50 values for CYE and CYEI mutants were 14.1 ± 1.8 and 58.1 ± 0.9 µM, respectively. The IC90 value for wild-type HBV was 30 ± 0.5 µM, whereas the IC90 values for CYE and CYEI mutants were 185 ± 0.5 and 790 ± 0.2 µM, respectively. Both tenofovir-resistant mutants and wild-type HBV had similar susceptibility to the capsid assembly modulator NVR 3–778 (IC50 <0.4 µM vs. IC50 = 0.4 µM, respectively). Our study reveals that the quadruple (CYEI) mutation increases the amount of tenofovir required to inhibit HBV by 15.3-fold in IC50 and 26.3-fold in IC90. These results demonstrate that tenofovir-resistant HBV mutants can emerge, although the genetic barrier is high. Worldwide, an estimated 2 billion people are infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and 686,000 people die from complications due to HBV each year.1 Despite the development of nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) drugs, antiviral therapy of HBV infection remains a major clinical issue. Due to both the viral persistence and heterogeneity of the HBV genome, the emergence of drug-resistant mutants is inevitable. The development of drug resistance is associated with poor prognosis. Problems arising from drug resistance include hepatitis flares, reversion of histologic improvement, and sometimes severe exacerbation of illness, hepatic decompensation, or death.2 In conclusion, although the use of TDF as CHB therapy was very successful for more than 10 years because of a high genetic barrier to resistance, we herein report that HBV isolated from 2 patients who developed phenotypic resistance during TDF therapy showed genotypic resistance in an in vitro study.To develop clinical resistance to TDF, the accumulation of at least 4 mutations is required, meaning that tenofovir has a higher genetic barrier to resistance than other NAs.However, since there is no proven rescue therapy option with NAs for patients with the tenofovir-resistance mutation, TDF monotherapy needs to be used with caution for patients with MDR HBV.Novel treatment options including a capsid assembly modulator should be tested as potential rescue therapies for patients with TDF-resistant HBV.Our findings suggest that the development of a new generation of anti-HBV drugs is urgently needed.
Non-invasive tools for monitoring treatment response and disease progression in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are needed. Our objective was to evaluate the utility of magnetic resonance (MR)-based hepatic imaging measures for the assessment of liver histology in patients with NASH. We analyzed data from patients with NASH and stage 2 or 3 fibrosis enrolled in a phase II study of selonsertib. Pre- and post-treatment assessments included centrally read MR elastography (MRE)-estimated liver stiffness, MR imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF), and liver biopsies evaluated according to the NASH Clinical Research Network classification and the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS). Among 54 patients with MRE and biopsies at baseline and week 24, 18 (33%) had fibrosis improvement (≥1-stage reduction) after undergoing 24 weeks of treatment with the study drug. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of MRE-stiffness to predict fibrosis improvement was 0.62 (95% CI 0.46–0.78) and the optimal threshold was a ≥0% relative reduction. At this threshold, MRE had 67% sensitivity, 64% specificity, 48% positive predictive value, 79% negative predictive value. Among 65 patients with MRI-PDFF and biopsies at baseline and week 24, a ≥1-grade reduction in steatosis was observed in 18 (28%). The AUROC of MRI-PDFF to predict steatosis response was 0.70 (95% CI 0.57–0.83) and the optimal threshold was a ≥0% relative reduction. At this threshold, MRI-PDFF had 89% sensitivity and 47% specificity, 39% positive predictive value, and 92% negative predictive value. These preliminary data support the further evaluation of MRE-stiffness and MRI-PDFF for the longitudinal assessment of histologic response in patients with NASH. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) characterized by the presence of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning with or without fibrosis.1 Patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis are at greatest risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality.2–5 The global prevalence of NASH is between 1.5% and 6.5%.6 Widespread screening is not currently feasible given that a definitive diagnosis of NASH can only be made through identification of the characteristic histopathologic pattern on liver biopsy.7 While liver biopsy remains the gold standard, its disadvantages are well known. It is an invasive procedure that can lead to serious complications, including hospitalization for pain, bleeding, and, in rare cases, death.8,9 Few patients are willing to undergo repeat biopsies necessary to monitor disease progression and to evaluate treatment response in trials of experimental therapeutic agents. Moreover, the interpretation of biopsy results is subject to variability due in part to inter- and intra-observer differences; the risk of sampling error is high due to the patchy nature of the histopathologic lesions in NASH; and biopsy is not able to discriminate intermediate stages of fibrosis.10–13 There is a pressing unmet medical need for reliable and accurate non-invasive tools to evaluate steatosis and fibrosis in patients with NASH, and to monitor response to treatment. In conclusion, these preliminary results provide further confirmation of the feasibility of obtaining MRE and MRI-PDFF in multicenter trials, and strengthen evidence that liver stiffness by MRE and MRI-PDFF are biomarkers of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis, respectively.Moreover, the data confirm that changes in MRI-PDFF are associated with changes in hepatic steatosis and overall NAS score response.For the first time, evidence of the ability of MRE to discriminate longitudinal changes in fibrosis in response to treatment – specifically, 24 weeks of selonsertib therapy – was demonstrated.Additional studies with larger populations and longer follow-up are required to confirm the linkage of liver stiffness by MRE to clinical outcomes.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in adults and children. Along with obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance, genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile acid metabolism and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with liver damage in NAFLD remains to be defined. We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on liver damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of the KLB mutant. The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with an increased risk of ballooning and lobular inflammation. KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free fatty acids caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB downregulation obtained by the expression of a KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular lipid accumulation and upregulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression. In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that the KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the leading cause of liver damage worldwide.1 The histologic spectrum of NAFLD ranges from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and eventually progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).2,3 NAFLD is a multifactorial disease where environmental factors, such as an excessive caloric intake and a sedentary lifestyle, and genetic factors interact with each other, triggering the metabolic and hepatic events that lead to liver fat accumulation and progressive liver disease.4 In recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified inherited variants in genes involved in hepatic fat uptake, synthesis, storage and mobilization of triglycerides which have been associated with a higher risk of NAFLD in adults.5–7 Most of these genetic variants, such as the rs738409 C>G in patatin-like phospholipase domain–containing 3 (PNPLA3) gene and the rs58542926 C>T in transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2) gene, also increase the risk of NAFLD in pediatric patients.8–10 Due to their effect size these polymorphisms explain the genetic susceptibility to NAFLD development and progression in most individuals.11 However, other genetic variants may contribute to determine the motley pattern of histologic features associated with NAFLD and to explain the missing heritability.12 In conclusion, we showed an association between rs17618244 KLB variant and the severity of NAFLD in Caucasian children.Moreover, we found that the KLB protein may protect against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism linking altered hepatic KLB expression to NAFLD development and progression.
Whether non-selective beta blockers (NSBBs) are deleterious in patients with end-stage cirrhosis and refractory ascites has been widely debated. We hypothesized that only the subset of patients on the liver transplant waiting list who had impaired cardiac performance would be at increased risk of mortality if receiving NSBBs. This study included 584 consecutive patients with cirrhosis evaluated for transplantation between 1999 and 2014. All patients had right heart catheterization with hemodynamic measurements at evaluation. Fifty percent received NSBBs. Refractory ascites was present in 33%. Cardiac performance was assessed by left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI). Waiting list mortality without liver transplantation was explored using competing risk analysis. LVSWI was significantly lower in patients with refractory ascites. In multivariate analysis using competing risk, refractory ascites, NSBBs and LVSWI were associated with waiting list mortality in the whole population, with a statistically significant interaction between NSBBs and LVSWI. The most discriminant value of LVSWI was 64.1 g-m/m2. In the final model, refractory ascites (subdistribution hazard ratio 1.52; 95% CI 1.01–2.28; p = 0.0083) and treatment by NSBBs with LVSWI <64.1 g-m/m2 (subdistribution hazard ratio 1.96; 95% CI 1.32–2.90; p = 0.0009) were significantly associated with waiting list mortality, taking into account serum sodium and the model for end-stage liver disease score. This study suggests that compromised cardiac performance is more common in patients with refractory ascites and that NSBBs are deleterious in cirrhotic patients with compromised cardiac performance. These results highlight the prognostic value of cardiac function in patients with end-stage cirrhosis. Complex interactions between splanchnic and systemic hemodynamic changes are characteristic features of advanced cirrhosis.1 Splanchnic and systemic vasodilation associated with decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and increased cardiac output (CO) result in a hyperkinetic state.2–4 However, the imbalance between systemic and splanchnic circulation is associated with a state of effective hypovolemia. Besides hyperkinetic state and effective hypovolemia, so-called cirrhotic cardiomyopathy was described several years ago.5,6 Typically, cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is characterized by (i) a blunted contractile responsiveness to stress, (ii) diastolic dysfunction and (iii) electromechanical abnormalities,5,7 in the absence of other known causes of heart disease. Such cardiac changes may be present in up to 60% of patients with cirrhosis, especially in those with ascites.8 However, the prevalence of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy has not been extensively investigated. In addition, some series suggest that cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is not related to the severity of cirrhosis,9 while others suggest a correlation between cardiac changes and disease severity.10,11 Moreover, the impact of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy on the outcome of patients with advanced cirrhosis and on post-transplant survival is poorly understood.11–15 In conclusion, this study shows that not all patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites are at higher risk of mortality when receiving NSBBs.However, in a subgroup of patients with impaired left ventricular reserve, NSBBs should not be initiated or should be discontinued as they have a deleterious impact on outcome, independent of the MELD score.Non-invasive tools are needed to assess cardiac reserve and to optimize the management of patients with end-stage cirrhosis.
Intrahepatic (ICC) and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) have rarely been studied individually, probably due to difficulties in their diagnosis and certification. Mortality trends from these 2 neoplasms have been inconsistent over the last decades. The aim of this study was to analyze worldwide trends in mortality from ICC and ECC in selected countries. We extracted death certification data for ICC and ECC, and population estimates from the World Health Organization and Pan American Health Organization databases for 32 selected countries from Europe, the Americas, and Australasia from 1995 to 2016. We computed age-standardized (world population) mortality rates from ICC and ECC, and performed joinpoint regression analysis. Mortality rates from ICC increased in all countries considered, with a levelling off over recent years in Germany (women), Italy (men), Argentina (men), the USA (men), Hong Kong (men), and Japan (both sexes). The highest rates in 2010–2014 (1.5–2.5/100,000 in men and 1.2–1.7/100,000 in women) were registered in Hong Kong, France, Austria, Spain, the UK, and Australia. The lowest rates (0.2–0.6/100,000 in both sexes) were registered in Latin American and eastern European countries. Mortality from ECC decreased in most of the countries considered, with rates below 1/100,000 in both sexes between 2010 and 2014, with the only exception being Japan (2.8/100,000 in men and 1.4/100,000 in women). Increasing mortality from ICC was observed globally, due to trends in risk factors and possibly, in part, due to better disease classification. Mortality from ECC levelled off or decreased, most likely following the increased use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Cholangiocarcinoma is the second most common primary liver neoplasm after hepatocellular carcinoma.1,2 These neoplasms arise from the epithelial cells of the biliary tree, commonly classified as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) if they arise above the hilar junction of bile ducts or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) if they arise within or below the hilum. In conclusion, our study provides strong confirmatory evidence on a global increase in mortality from ICC, whose causes need to be better understood by conducting targeted investigations.Such studies should consider ICC separately from ECC.
Fibrosis, a cardinal feature of a dysfunctional liver, significantly contributes to the ever-increasing mortality due to end-stage chronic liver diseases. The crosstalk between hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) plays a key role in the progression of fibrosis. Although ample efforts have been devoted to elucidate the functions of HSCs during liver fibrosis, the regulatory functions of hepatocytes remain elusive. Using an unbiased functional microRNA (miRNA) screening, we investigated the ability of hepatocytes to regulate fibrosis by fine-tuning gene expression via miRNA modulation. The in vivo functional analyses were performed by inhibiting miRNA in hepatocytes using adeno-associated virus in carbon-tetrachloride- and 3,5-di-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine-induced liver fibrosis. Blocking miRNA-221-3p function in hepatocytes during chronic liver injury facilitated recovery of the liver and faster resolution of the deposited extracellular matrix. Furthermore, we demonstrate that reduced secretion of C–C motif chemokine ligand 2, as a result of post-transcriptional regulation of GNAI2 (G protein alpha inhibiting activity polypeptide 2) by miRNA-221-3p, mitigates liver fibrosis. Collectively, miRNA modulation in hepatocytes, an easy-to-target cell type in the liver, may serve as a potential therapeutic approach for liver fibrosis. Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis contribute to more than 1 million deaths per year worldwide1,2 (particularly, 170,000 per year in Europe3 and 33,539 per year in the United States4). The underlying pathologies leading to fibrosis and subsequently cirrhosis are chronic virus infection, alcoholic steatohepatitis, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.5 The manifestation of fibrosis is accompanied by the activation of quiescent HSCs, accumulation of excessive extracellular matrix, and hepatocyte dysfunction leading to liver failure.6 While the majority of efforts have been concentrated on the elucidation of HSCs function during fibrosis, the regulatory functions of hepatocyte, the main parenchymal cells of the liver, remain to be understood further. Specifically, how gene expression alterations, particularly at the post-transcriptional level in hepatocytes, regulate fibrosis remains to be investigated. MiRNAs, one of the post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression,7,8 have been reported to be deregulated in liver fibrosis.7,9 The majority of studies have examined the functions of miRNAs in HSCs; however, identification and functional analysis of hepatocyte miRNAs, which are capable of regulating fibrosis, remain to be investigated. Elucidation of such key fibrosis-regulating miRNAs in hepatocytes, an easy-to-target cell type in the liver, would allow development of successful therapeutics for liver fibrosis. 
Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, the cellular defense mechanisms underlying ALD are not well understood. Recent studies highlighted the involvement of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism. Sorting nexin (SNX)-10 has a regulatory function in endolysosomal trafficking and stabilisation. Here, we investigated the roles of SNX10 in CMA activation and in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis. Snx10 knockout (Snx10 KO) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates fed either the Lieber–DeCarli liquid alcohol diet or a control liquid diet, and primary cultured WT and Snx10 KO hepatocytes stimulated with ethanol, were used as in vivo and in vitro ALD models, respectively. Activation of CMA, liver injury parameters, inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and lipid metabolism were measured. Compared with WT littermates, Snx10 KO mice exhibited a significant amelioration in ethanol-induced liver injury and hepatic steatosis. Both in vivo and in vitro studies showed that SNX10 deficiency upregulated lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A) expression and CMA activation, which could be reversed by SNX10 overexpression in vitro. LAMP-2A interference confirmed that the upregulation of Nrf2 and AMPK signalling pathways induced by SNX10 deficiency relied on CMA activation. Pull-down assays revealed an interaction between SNX10 and cathepsin A (CTSA), a key enzyme involved in LAMP-2A degradation. Deficiency in SNX10 inhibited CTSA maturation and increased the stability of LAMP-2A, resulting in an increase in CMA activity. SNX10 controls CMA activity by mediating CTSA maturation, and, thus, has an essential role in alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis. Our results provide evidence for SNX10 as a potential promising therapeutic target for preventing or ameliorating liver injury in ALD. Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a spectrum of disorders ranging from reversible steatosis to life-threatening and irreversible cirrhosis, and, in some patients, hepatocellular cancer.1 Alcohol exposure induces oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which lead to hepatocyte apoptosis, necrosis, and necroptosis, as well as hepatic inflammation. In addition, ethanol consumption disrupts lipid metabolism and subsequently results in the accumulation of excessive triglycerides in the liver, further aggravating liver injury.2 Even though much research has focussed on understanding the pathological features of ALD, the cellular mechanisms that defend against the detrimental effects of alcohol remain unclear. Although therapeutic strategies, including alcohol abstinence, corticosteroids, biologics such as anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and liver transplantation have been used, these might not be always either practical or sufficient.3,4 Thus, there is an urgent need to develop specific therapies for ALD. In conclusion, in the current study, SNX10 was upregulated by ethanol stimulation in hepatocytes.Deficiency in SNX10 increased CMA activity by enhancing LAMP-2A stability, inhibiting proteasome activity and resulting in the activation of the Nrf2–HO1 and AMPK signalling pathways.This in turn prevented hepatic oxidative stress and steatosis induced by ethanol consumption, and subsequently protected the mice against ethanol-induced liver injury (Fig. 9).Our study reveals a crucial role for SNX10 in regulating CMA activity, and provides evidence for SNX10 as a potential promising therapeutic target for halting injury in ALD.We propose SNX10 as an attractive target for future therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing CMA activity in ALD.
In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatocytes can undergo necroptosis, a regulated form of necrotic cell death mediated by the receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 1. We herein assessed the potential of RIPK1 and its downstream effector mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), as therapeutic targets and markers of activity in NAFLD. C57/BL6J-mice were fed a normal chow diet (NCD) or high fat diet (HFD). The effect of RIPA-56, a highly specific inhibitor of RIPK1, was evaluated in either a prophylactic or a curative treatment of HFD-fed mice, and in primary human steatotic hepatocytes. RIPK1 and MLKL concentrations were measured in the serum of patients with NAFLD. Both prophylactic and curative treatments of HFD-fed mice with RIPA-56, caused a down-regulation of MLKL and a reduction of liver injury, inflammation and fibrosis, characteristic of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), as well as of steatosis. This latter effect was reproduced by treating primary human steatotic hepatocytes with RIPA-56 or necrosulfonamide (NSA), a specific inhibitor of human MLKL, and by knocking out (KO) MLKL in fat-loaded AML-12 mouse hepatocytes. MLKL KO in steatotic hepatocytes, caused an activation of the mitochondrial respiration, and an increase in β-oxidation. Along with MLKL decreased activation, RIPK3-KO mice exhibited increased activities of the liver mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in experimental NASH. In patients with NAFLD, serum concentrations of RIPK1 and MLKL increased in correlation with the activity. The inhibition of RIPK1 improves NASH features in HFD-fed mice and reverses steatosis by an MLKL-dependent mechanism that involves at least partly an increase in mitochondrial respiration. RIPK1 and MLKL are potential serum markers of activity and promising therapeutic targets in NAFLD. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been paralleling the worldwide increase in obesity for the last decades. It has become the most common chronic liver disease, and now affects up to one third of the adult population in Western countries [1]. NAFLD encompasses a continuum of entities that span from plain steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis and ultimately end-stage liver disease [2]. Hepatocyte cell death is a critical event in the progression of all chronic inflammatory liver diseases including NAFLD [3]. Until recently, two main forms of cell death were recognized: apoptosis, which occurs in a highly controlled manner, and necrosis that is accidentally triggered. However, during the past few years, it became clear that programmed cell death was not restricted to apoptosis, and comprised other forms of regulated cell death [4]. Necroptosis is one of them, combining the molecular machinery of the extrinsic apoptotic pathways with an execution similar to necrosis [4]. Unlike apoptosis that requires the activation of aspartate-specific proteases known as caspases [5], necroptosis is driven by the activation of the receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 1 and 3, and the pseudo kinase mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) [4]. Previous studies have shown that ablation of RIPK3 protected mice from the development of steatohepatitis and fibrosis in a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet mouse model [6, 7]. In addition, it has been demonstrated that necroptosis was activated in the hepatocytes of patients with NASH [6-8]. Overall, compelling studies have shown that RIP kinases were pleiotropic modulators of cell death and participated in the pathogenesis of many chronic diseases [9]. Therefore, there is evidence to suggest that by preventing the formation and/or activation of the necrosome, one could limit cell death and possibly disease progression in NASH. 
To affect immune response and inflammation, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) substantially influences intercellular communication pathways that are decisive for immune cell recruitment. The present study investigates mechanisms by which HCV modulates chemokine-mediated intercellular communication from infected cells. Chemokine expression was studied in HCVcc-infected cell lines or cell lines harbouring a subgenomic replicon, as well as in serum samples from patients. Expression or activity of mediators and signalling intermediates was manipulated using knockdown approaches or specific inhibitors. HCV enhances expression of CXCR2 ligands in its host cell via the induction of epidermal growth factor (EGF) production. Knockdown of EGF or of the p65 subunit of the NF-κB complex results in a substantial downregulation of HCV-induced CXCR2 ligand expression, supporting the involvement of an EGF-dependent mechanism as well as activation of NF-κB. Furthermore, HCV upregulates expression of CXCR2 ligands in response to EGF stimulation via downregulation of the T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP [PTPN2]), activation of NF-κB, and enhancement of EGF-inducible signal transduction via MEK1 (MAP2K1). This results in the production of a cytokine/chemokine pattern by the HCV-infected cell that can recruit neutrophils but not monocytes. These data reveal a novel EGF-dependent mechanism by which HCV influences chemokine-mediated intercellular communication. We propose that this mechanism contributes to modulation of the HCV-induced inflammation and the antiviral immune response. As a leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, in more than 70% of infected individuals HCV establishes a persistent infection characterised by continuous replication and high serum titres. The high propensity for persistence and the insidious course of disease is suggestive of powerful mechanisms allowing HCV to subvert host antiviral immunity, to modify the inflammatory response, and to utilise host cell infrastructure without affecting cell viability. This enables the virus to avert development of overt disease over decades, despite ongoing viral replication. At least in part, this is because HCV is tightly interconnected to host intercellular and intracellular signalling pathways.1,2 Hence, investigating the interaction of HCV with its host also provides a possibility to illuminate pathways that are relevant for the regulation of different processes of the host, such as growth factor signalling, control of cell growth, differentiation or cell death, inflammatory processes, and antiviral immunity. Amazingly, HCV achieves this molecular piracy with only 10 viral proteins, proteolytically released from one single precursor protein, which is encoded by a positive stranded viral RNA genome. These proteins are multifunctional and required for virus particle formation as well as RNA replication, but also for a broad interaction with different signal transduction pathways of the host.1 For example, the viral protease NS3/4A on the one hand is central to the processing of the viral precursor protein to generate mature viral proteins. On the other hand, it mediates proteolytic cleavage of different signalling molecules of the host cell such as mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein (MAVS)3 and TRIF (TICAM1)4 involved in antiviral signalling, or the ubiquitously expressed T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP [PTPN2]).5,6 Being an endogenous negative regulator of the EGF receptor (EGFR),7 cleavage of the latter results in a sensitisation of the EGFR and subsequent signal transduction, as well as in a constitutive and ligand independent activation of AKT kinase.5 Consistently, TC-PTP expression is reduced in individuals with chronic HCV infection5,8 and in mice with liver-specific expression of the viral NS3/4A protease.5,6 These animals not only show an enhanced ligand-induced activation of EGFR and its downstream signalling intermediates but also an altered composition of immune cells in their liver tissue.6,9 This indicates that HCV or HCV-encoded proteins can markedly influence intercellular communication signals crucial for immune cell recruitment. Among these, chemokines are the most important factors that control recruitment of immune cells and determine the local immunological and inflammatory environment. Indeed, the production of several chemokines, including CCL2 or CXCL8, is influenced by HCV replication as well as by isolated expression of HCV-encoded proteins.10 Thereby CXCL8 belongs to a group of chemokines that are recognised by the chemokine receptor CXCR2 and play an important role in the recruitment of neutrophil granulocytes,11 which most likely contribute to the increased serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, which can be observed in individuals with chronic HCV infection.12 The upregulation of TNFα appears to also be responsible for protection against the deleterious effects of lipopolysaccharide observed in transgenic mice with liver-specific expression of NS3/4A.13 However, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of chemokine production by HCV are incompletely understood and are the subject of the research described in the present manuscript. 
Severe acute liver injury is a grave complication of exertional heatstroke. Liver transplantation (LT) may be a therapeutic option, but the criteria for LT and the optimal timing of LT have not been clearly established. The aim of this study was to define the profile of patients who require transplantation in this context. This was a multicentre, retrospective study of patients admitted with a diagnosis of exertional heatstroke-related severe acute liver injury with a prothrombin time (PT) of less than 50%. A total of 24 male patients were studied. Fifteen of the 24 patients (median nadir PT: 35% [29.5–40.5]) improved under medical therapy alone and survived. Nine of the 24 were listed for emergency LT. At the time of registration, the median PT was 10% (5–12) and all had numerous dysfunctional organs. Five patients (nadir PT: 12% [9–12]) were withdrawn from the list because of an elevation of PT values that mainly occurred between day 2 and day 3. Ultimately, 4 patients underwent transplantation as their PT persisted at <10%, 3 days (2.75–3.25) after the onset of exertional heatstroke, and they had more than 3 organ dysfunctions. Of these 4 patients, 3 were still alive 1 year later. Histological analysis of the 4 explanted livers demonstrated massive or sub-massive necrosis, and little potential for effective mitoses, characterised by a “mitonecrotic” appearance. The first-line treatment for exertional heatstroke-related severe acute liver injury is medical therapy. LT is only a rare alternative and such a decision should not be taken too hastily. A persistence of PT <10%, without any signs of elevation after a median period of 3  days following the onset of heatstroke, was the trigger that prompted LT, was the trigger adopted in order to decide upon LT. Exertional heatstroke is a rare but serious complication that can occur during intense and prolonged physical exercise in a hot and humid climate. It is mainly characterised by hyperthermia higher than 40 °C associated with central neurological disorders. It occurs in individuals who were previously in good health.1 Heatstroke involving severe liver injury, associated or not with the dysfunction of other organs, improves in more than 80% of cases with medical therapy alone. An improvement in liver function is possible, even with low prothrombin values. LT only represents a rare alternative and achieves good survival rates after surgery. However, the decision to transplant should not be taken hastily and must take account of the kinetics of PT and of the patient’s clinical status. The peculiar histological features observed on all explanted livers and the aspect of abortive mitoses in hepatocytes could be attributed to the effects of heatstroke and help explain the severity of transplanted patients. However, given that only a few patients were biopsied, we cannot yet recommend liver biopsy to help select the patients who would require LT.
Sterile inflammation resulting in alcoholic hepatitis (AH) occurs unpredictably after many years of excess alcohol intake. The factors responsible for the development of AH are not known but mitochondrial damage with loss of mitochondrial function are common features. Hcar2 is a G-protein coupled receptor which is activated by β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). We aimed to determine the relevance of the BHB-Hcar2 pathway in alcoholic liver disease. We tested if loss of BHB production can result in increased liver inflammation. We further tested if BHB supplementation is protective in AH through interaction with Hcar2, and analyzed the immune and cellular basis for protection. Humans with AH have reduced hepatic BHB, and inhibition of BHB production in mice aggravated ethanol-induced AH, with higher plasma alanine aminotransferase levels, increased steatosis and greater neutrophil influx. Conversely supplementation of BHB had the opposite effects with reduced alanine aminotransferase levels, reduced steatosis and neutrophil influx. This therapeutic effect of BHB is dependent on the receptor Hcar2. BHB treatment increased liver Il10 transcripts, and promoted the M2 phenotype of intrahepatic macrophages. BHB also increased the transcriptional level of M2 related genes in vitro bone marrow derived macrophages. This skewing towards M2 related genes is dependent on lower mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) induced by BHB. Collectively, our data shows that BHB production during excess alcohol consumption has an anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective role through an Hcar2 dependent pathway. This introduces the concept of metabolite-based therapy for AH. Excess alcohol intake has many effects on the liver and can present with several clinical syndromes.1 One of the most serious is acute alcoholic hepatitis (AH), which occurs unexpectedly after decades of high levels of alcohol consumption, and is characterized by sterile liver inflammation, jaundice and can progress to a systemic inflammatory response.2 There is a mixed inflammatory infiltrate characterized by neutrophils, and upregulation of a variety of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6. Due to the ubiquitous development of hepatocyte steatosis there has been sustained interest in aspects of mitochondrial function related to lipid metabolism, particularly mitochondrial β-oxidation.3 In vivo and in vitro models have shown diverse effects of alcohol on mitochondrial biology including abnormal mitochondrial morphology (giant mitochondria), mitochondrial DNA fragmentation, deceased mitochondrial protein synthesis by inhibition of mitochondrial ribosome activity, and oxidation of mitochondrial proteins.3 Measurement of the steps in β-oxidation has demonstrated inhibition after acute and chronic alcohol exposure, which is caused by downregulation of genes involved in fatty acid uptake as well as oxidation.4,5 
The impact of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection on outcomes after resection of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) has not been reported. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of antiviral therapy on survival outcomes after liver resection for patients with ICC and underlying HBV infection. Data on 928 patients with ICC and HBV infection who underwent liver resection at two medical centers between 2006 and 2011 were analyzed. Data on viral reactivation, tumor recurrence, cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were obtained. Survival rates were analyzed using the time-dependent Cox regression model adjusted for potential covariates. Postoperative viral reactivation occurred in 3.3%, 8.3% and 15.7% of patients who received preoperative antiviral therapy, who did not receive preoperative antiviral therapy with a low, or a high HBV-DNA level (< or ≥2,000 IU/ml), respectively (p <0.001). A high viral level and viral reactivation were independent risk factors of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 1.22 and 1.34), CSS (HR 1.36 and 1.46) and OS (HR 1.23 and 1.36). Five-year recurrence, CSS and OS were better in patients who received antiviral therapy (70.5%, 46.9% and 43.0%) compared with patients who did not receive antiviral therapy and had a high viral level (86.5%, 20.9% and 20.5%, all p <0.001), respectively. The differences in recurrence, CSS and OS were minimal compared with no-antiviral therapy patients with a low viral level (71.7%, 35.5% and 33.5%, p = 0.057, 0.051 and 0.060, respectively). Compared to patients with a high viral level who received no antiviral therapy, patients who initiated antiviral therapy either before or after surgery had better long-term outcomes (HR 0.44 and 0.54 for recurrence; 0.38 and 0.57 for CSS; 0.46 and 0.54 for OS, respectively). Viral reactivation was associated with worse prognoses after liver resection for HBV-infected patients with ICC. Antiviral therapy decreased viral reactivation and prolonged long-term survival for patients with ICC and a high viral level. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) accounts for 10%–20% of primary liver cancer, with an incidence second only to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).1 In addition, the incidence and related mortality of ICC are dramatically increasing worldwide.1,2 Currently, liver resection (LR) is the only established treatment to achieve possible long-term survival for patients with ICC,1,3 with an associated five-year survival ranging from 26.4% to 35.2%.4,5 The poor long-term outcomes following resection are related to the aggressive and invasive nature of this malignancy.6,7 In conclusion, preoperative AVT reduced viral reactivation and decreased related morbidity after LR for HBV-infected patients with ICC.AVT initiated either before or after LR significantly decreased tumor recurrence and prolonged long-term survival.
Acute liver failure is a rapidly progressive deterioration of hepatic function resulting in high mortality and morbidity. Metabolic enzymes can translocate to the nucleus to regulate histone acetylation and gene expression. Levels and activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were evaluated in nuclear fractions of livers of mice exposed to various hepatotoxins including CD95-antibody, α-amanitin, and acetaminophen. Whole-genome gene expression profiling by RNA-seq was performed in livers of mice with acute liver failure and analyzed by gene ontology enrichment analysis. Cell viability was evaluated in cell lines knocked-down for PDHA1 or LDH-A and in cells incubated with the LDH inhibitor galloflavin after treatment with CD95-antibody. We evaluated whether the histone acetyltransferase inhibitor garcinol or galloflavin could reduce liver damage in mice with acute liver failure. Levels and activities of PDHC and LDH were increased in nuclear fractions of livers of mice with acute liver failure. The increase of nuclear PDHC and LDH was associated with increased concentrations of acetyl-CoA and lactate in nuclear fractions, and histone H3 hyper-acetylation. Gene expression in livers of mice with acute liver failure suggested that increased histone H3 acetylation induces the expression of genes related to damage response. Reduced histone acetylation by the histone acetyltransferase inhibitor garcinol decreased liver damage and improved survival in mice with acute liver failure. Knock-down of PDHC or LDH improved viability in cells exposed to a pro-apoptotic stimulus. Treatment with the LDH inhibitor galloflavin that was also found to inhibit PDHC, reduced hepatic necrosis, apoptosis, and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice with acute liver failure. Mice treated with galloflavin also showed a dose-response increase in survival. PDHC and LDH translocate to the nucleus, leading to increased nuclear concentrations of acetyl-CoA and lactate. This results in histone H3 hyper-acetylation and expression of damage response genes. Inhibition of PDHC and LDH reduces liver damage and improves survival in mice with acute liver failure. Thus, PDHC and LDH are targets for therapy of acute liver failure. Acute liver failure is a rapidly progressive, life-threatening deterioration of liver function that results in altered neurological state and coagulopathy. The only treatment that improves the outcome of acute liver failure is emergency liver transplantation. Because liver transplantation has limitations related to invasiveness, limited donor availability and high mortality, therapies for acute liver failure are urgently needed. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that nLDH and/or nPDHC are targets for therapy of patients with acute liver failure of different etiologies.
Liver function tests (LFTs) are frequently requested blood tests which may indicate liver disease. LFTs are commonly abnormal, the causes of which can be complex and are frequently under investigated. This can lead to missed opportunities to diagnose and treat liver disease at an early stage. We developed an automated investigation algorithm, intelligent liver function testing (iLFT), with the aim of increasing the early diagnosis of liver disease in a cost-effective manner. We developed an automated system that further investigated abnormal LFTs on initial testing samples to generate a probable diagnosis and management plan. We integrated this automated investigation algorithm into the laboratory management system, based on minimal diagnostic criteria, liver fibrosis estimation, and reflex testing for causes of liver disease. This algorithm then generated a diagnosis and/or management plan. A stepped-wedged trial design was utilised to compare LFT outcomes in general practices in the 6 months before and after introduction of the iLFT system. Diagnostic outcomes were collated and compared. Of eligible patients with abnormal LFTs, 490 were recruited to the control group and 64 were recruited to the intervention group. The primary diagnostic outcome was based on the general practitioner diagnosis, which agreed with the iLFT diagnosis in 67% of cases. In the iLFT group, the diagnosis of liver disease was increased by 43%. Additionally, there were significant increases in the rates of GP visits after diagnosis and the number of referrals to secondary care in the iLFT group. iLFT was cost-effective with a low initial incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £284 per correct diagnosis, and a saving to the NHS of £3,216 per patient lifetime. iLFT increases liver disease diagnoses, improves quality of care, and is highly cost-effective. This can be achieved with minor changes to working practices and exploitation of functionality existing within modern laboratory diagnostics systems. There has been an exponential increase in the number of liver function tests (LFTs) requested in general practice.1,2 A proportion are checked for the investigation of liver disease but most are for investigating undifferentiated illness, or monitoring non-hepatic long-term health conditions.3–5 It is unknown how significant a solitary abnormal LFT result is;1 does it signify current or future liver disease, disease in other organs, or is it a temporary phenomenon of little clinical relevance?6 Liver disease is increasing in incidence in contrast to many other conditions, predominantly driven by NAFLD. It disproportionately affects people under 65 leading to substantially increased morbidity and mortality. It is clear that interventions that lead to early diagnosis and the opportunity to intervene and abate disease progression are needed. iLFT delivers this opportunity in primary care to the general population at a minimal intervention cost, using existing infrastructure and utilising existing clinical pathways. It is designed for immediate implementation and could have impacts in the short term. The iLFT system works, it increases liver diagnosis, is cost-effective, and is clearly more effective at diagnosing liver disease than the standard of care.
Liver fibrosis is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular matrix produced by hepatic myofibroblasts (hMF), the activation of which is critical to the fibrogenic process. Extracellular ATP, released by dying or stressed cells, and its purinergic receptors, constitute a powerful signaling network after injury. Although the purinergic receptor P2X4 (P2RX4) is highly expressed in the liver, its functions in hMF had never been investigated during liver fibrogenesis. In vivo, bile duct ligation was performed and methionine- and choline-deficient diet administered in wild-type and P2x4 knock-out (P2x4-KO) mice. In vitro, hMF were isolated from mouse (wild-type and P2x4-KO) and human liver. P2X4 pharmacological inhibition (in vitro and in vivo) and P2X4 siRNAs (in vitro) were used. Histological, biochemical and cell culture analysis allowed us to study P2X4 expression and its involvement in the regulation of fibrogenic and fibrolytic factors, as well as of hMF activation markers and properties. P2X4 genetic invalidation or pharmacological inhibition protected mice from liver fibrosis and hMF accumulation after bile duct ligation or methionine- and choline-deficient diet. Human and mouse hMFs expressed P2X4, mainly in lysosomes. Invalidation of P2X4 in human and mouse hMFs blunted their activation marker expression and their fibrogenic properties. Finally, we showed that P2X4 regulates calcium entry and lysosomal exocytosis in hMF, impacting on ATP release, profibrogenic secretory profile, and transcription factor activation. P2X4 expression and activation is critical for hMF to sustain their activated and fibrogenic phenotype. Therefore, the inactivation of P2X4 may be of therapeutic interest during liver fibrotic diseases. Beside huge regenerative properties, the liver classically undergoes fibrogenesis in association with liver repair during chronic injury, impairing hepatic functions with high morbidity and mortality.1 As well as in other organs, in the liver, the main cellular contributor to excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition is the myofibroblast, derived from hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and/or portal fibroblasts2 after acute or during chronic liver injury. Hepatic myofibroblasts (hMF) are characterized by αSMA (ACTA2) expression, contractile properties, and by overexpressed ECM components and regulators. The acquisition of an ECM remodeling phenotype in hMF during liver injury is strongly dependent on a complex network of cellular interactions within the liver microenvironment, involving a large number of cytokines and growth factors.1 Nevertheless, the so-called “danger activated molecular patterns”, released by dying or stressed cells during injury, including extracellular ATP, also constitute a powerful signaling network which impact on liver fibrogenetic processes.3,4 In general, signaling via extracellular ATP and its receptors, i.e. P2Y (G protein-coupled receptors) and P2X (ligand-gated ion channels), is reported to have regulatory impact on fundamental processes like secretion, contraction, survival and proliferation in a wide spectrum of cells and tissues, including the liver.5,6 ATP release from cells occurs under different stress conditions, particularly under osmotic or mechanical challenge.7 In the liver, each cell type expresses its own repertoire of purinoceptor subtypes and ectoATPases,8 P2X4 (P2RX4) and P2X7 (P2RX7) often being predominant among P2 receptor subtypes.9,10 We previously observed robust ATP release from the liver immediately after partial hepatectomy (PH) in rats and in human living transplant donors, resulting from intrahepatic mechanical stress and contributing to hepatocyte cell cycle entry.11 In a recent study in mice, we proposed that during liver regeneration after PH, ATP signaling through P2X4 contributed to the control of biliary homeostasis, with a resulting impact on hepatocyte protection and proliferation, through basic mechanisms involving exocytosis of lysosomes, an organelle in which P2X4 is strongly expressed.10 Beside evidence for a purinergic-dependent regulation of liver repair after acute injury,10–13 only few data are available as far as chronic liver injury and fibrogenesis are concerned. Previous studies in the context of liver fibrosis reported that adenosine (ATP's breakdown product), and its A1 and A2 receptors provide profibrogenic signals,14 at least in part through modulation of macrophage or HSC activation,15 although some contradictory results have been reported.16 Regarding the P2 side of purinergic input signaling during liver fibrosis, while some P2Y isoforms have been reported to be expressed and to play some role in HSC-myofibroblast differentiation,17,18 most of the recent studies were focused on P2X7 signaling. In mice, pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of P2X7 resulted in less carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced liver fibrosis,19,20 through incompletely defined cell-specific mechanisms, including impact on splanchnic hemodynamics20 and myofibroblast activation and/or inflammasome induction.21–23 However, a clear picture of the purinergic-related control of liver fibrogenesis is still lacking, in particular according to cell types, ligands and receptors involved, and finally depending on the experimental model used. Indeed, biliary and non-biliary type fibrosis appeared to exhibit differential sensitivity to purinergic signals and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.16,18 Importantly, other P2 receptors, including the highly expressed P2X4, were not investigated in the context of liver fibrogenesis. As P2X4 was reported to regulate secretion of inflammatory mediators,24 cytoskeleton organisation25 and collagen deposition26 in extrahepatic sites, we aimed at studying the impact of P2X4 on hMF phenotype and liver fibrogenesis. 
To eliminate hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, it is essential to scale up antiviral treatment through decentralized services. However, access to the conventional tools to assess treatment eligibility (liver biopsy/Fibroscan®/HBV DNA) is limited and not affordable in resource-limited countries. We developed and validated a simple score to easily identify patients in need of HBV treatment in Africa. As a reference, we used treatment eligibility determined by the European Association for the Study of the Liver based on alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver histology and/or Fibroscan and HBV DNA. We derived a score indicating treatment eligibility by a stepwise logistic regression using a cohort of chronic HBV infection in The Gambia (n = 804). We subsequently validated the score in an external cohort of HBV-infected Africans from Senegal, Burkina Faso, and Europe (n = 327). Out of several parameters, two remained in the final model, namely HBV e antigen (HBeAg) and ALT level, constituting a simple score (treatment eligibility in Africa for the hepatitis B virus: TREAT-B). The score demonstrated a high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.85, 95% CI 0.79–0.91) in the validation set. The score of 2 and above (HBeAg-positive and ALT ≥20 U/L or HBeAg-negative and ALT ≥40 U/L) had a sensitivity and specificity for treatment eligibility of 85% and 77%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the World Health Organization criteria based on the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and ALT were 90% and 40%, respectively. A simple score based on HBeAg and ALT had a high diagnostic accuracy for the selection of patients for HBV treatment. This score could be useful in African settings. Viral hepatitis is a major global health problem. In 2013, an estimated 1.45 million people died from viral hepatitis.1 This is the seventh leading cause of death worldwide, ranked higher than any of the major infectious agents: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis and malaria. Of these hepatitis-related deaths, most of them occur in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), and about half are attributable to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, causing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).1 In conclusion, TREAT-B represents a promising simple and low-cost diagnostic score that can assist physicians to easily identify HBV-infected individuals in need of treatment in Africa.Its use may contribute towards global HBV elimination by facilitating the scale up and decentralization of HBV treatment programs in LMICs.TREAT-B deserves to be further validated in other African and non-African patients with chronic hepatitis B in LMICs.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol-related liver disease pose an important challenge to current clinical healthcare pathways because of the large number of at-risk patients. Therefore, we aimed to explore the cost-effectiveness of transient elastography (TE) as a screening method to detect liver fibrosis in a primary care pathway. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using real-life individual patient data from 6 independent prospective cohorts (5 from Europe and 1 from Asia). A diagnostic algorithm with conditional inference trees was developed to explore the relationships between liver stiffness, socio-demographics, comorbidities, and hepatic fibrosis, the latter assessed by fibrosis scores (FIB-4, NFS) and liver biopsies in a subset of 352 patients. We compared the incremental cost-effectiveness of a screening strategy against standard of care alongside the numbers needed to screen to diagnose a patient with fibrosis stage ≥F2. The data set encompassed 6,295 participants (mean age 55 ± 12 years, BMI 27 ± 5 kg/m2, liver stiffness 5.6 ± 5.0 kPa). A 9.1 kPa TE cut-off provided the best accuracy for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis (≥F2) in general population settings, whereas a threshold of 9.5 kPa was optimal for populations at-risk of alcohol-related liver disease. TE with the proposed cut-offs outperformed fibrosis scores in terms of accuracy. Screening with TE was cost-effective with mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from 2,570 €/QALY (95% CI 2,456–2,683) for a population at-risk of alcohol-related liver disease (age ≥45 years) to 6,217 €/QALY (95% CI 5,832–6,601) in the general population. Overall, there was a 12% chance of TE screening being cost saving across countries and populations. Screening for liver fibrosis with TE in primary care is a cost-effective intervention for European and Asian populations and may even be cost saving. Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are leading causes of chronic liver diseases, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-related deaths worldwide.1,2 While the causes, consequences and treatment strategies for ALD and NAFLD are being studied and developed,3–5 the majority of patients are still diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease.6 Consequently, the course of action towards early disease detection from a public health perspective remains a grey area in hepatology.7 
Liver adenomatosis (LA) is characterized by the presence of at least 10 hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs), but the natural history of this rare liver disorder remains unclear. Thus, we aimed to reappraise the natural history and the risk of complications in a cohort of patients with at least 10 HCAs. We analyzed the natural history of 40 patients with LA, excluding glycogen storage disorders, in a monocentric cohort. Pathological examination was performed, with immunostaining and molecular biology carried out on surgical specimens or liver biopsies. Forty patients (36 female) were included with a median follow-up of 10.6 (1.9–26.1) years. Six (15%) patients had familial LA, all with germline HNF1A mutations. Median age at diagnosis was 39 (9–55) years. Thirty-three (94%) women had a history of oral contraception, and 29 (81%) women had a pregnancy before LA diagnosis. Overall, thirty-seven (93%) patients underwent surgery at diagnosis. Classification of HCAs showed 46% of patients with HNF1A-mutated HCA, 31% with inflammatory HCA, 3% with sonic hedgehog HCA, 8% with unclassified HCA. Only 15% of the patients demonstrated a “mixed LA” with different HCA subtypes. Hepatic complications were identified in 7 patients: 1 patient (3%) died from recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplantation; 6 (15%) had hemorrhages, of which 5 occurred at diagnosis, with 1 fatal case during pregnancy, and 2 occurred in male patients with familial LA. Four patients (10%) had repeated liver resections. Finally, 4 (10%) patients developed extrahepatic malignancies during follow-up. The diversity in HCA subtypes, as well as the occurrence of bleeding and malignant transformation during long-term follow-up, underline the heterogeneous nature of LA, justifying close and specific management. In patients with germline HNF1A mutation, familial LA occurred equally frequently in males and females, with a higher rate of bleeding in male patients. Hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) are rare benign liver tumors that increased in frequency after the wide prescription of oral contraceptive pills in the 1960s. Currently the prevalence of HCAs ranges between 1 and 4 per 100,000 individuals.1 Owing to its estrogen-dependence, the female to male ratio is 10:1 and HCAs predominantly affect young women around 30–40 years old.2,3 The 2 major risks of HCAs are symptomatic hemorrhage and malignant transformation, which are estimated to occur in 15% and 5% of cases in surgical series, respectively.3,4 Lesion size greater >5 cm is a risk factor for both complications, while male sex is a risk factor for malignant transformation.3,5 
Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D) is an autosomal recessive condition that may present in a mild form (cholesteryl ester storage disease [CESD]), which mimics non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It has been suggested that CESD may affect 1 in 40,000 and is under-diagnosed in NAFLD clinics. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of LAL-D using analysis of genetic variation in LIPA. MEDLINE and EMBASE were systematically searched for previously reported disease variants and prevalence estimates. Previous prevalence estimates were meta-analysed. Disease variants in LIPA were annotated with allele frequencies from gnomAD and combined with unreported major functional variants found in humans. Pooled ethnicity-specific prevalences for LAL-D and CESD were calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg equation. Meta-analysis of existing genetic studies estimated the prevalence of LAL-D as 1 per 160,000 (95% CI 1 per 65,025–761,652) using the allele frequency of c.894G>A in LIPA. A total of 98 previously reported disease variants in LIPA were identified, of which 32/98 were present in gnomAD, giving a prevalence of 1 per 307,482 (95% CI 257,672–366,865). Wolman disease was associated with more loss-of-function variants than CESD. When this was combined with 22 previously unreported major functional variants in LIPA identified in humans, the pooled prevalence of LAL-D was 1 per 177,452 (95% CI 149,467–210,683) with a carrier frequency of 1 per 421. The prevalence is lowest in those of East Asian, South Asian, and Finnish ancestry. Using 120 disease variants in LIPA, these data can reassure clinicians that LAL-D is an ultra-rare disorder. Given the therapeutic capability of sebelipase alpha, investigation for LAL-D might be included in second-line metabolic screening in NAFLD. Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in LIPA that manifest as a spectrum of liver disease and dyslipidaemia.1,2 It is regarded as a rare disorder however recognition of more mild forms of the condition have led to the suggestion that it may represent a significant proportion of patients presenting with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).3,4 Emerging data have also reported reduced lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) activity in association with more advanced NAFLD.5–8 Clarity on the prevalence of LAL-D, and its distribution across ethnicities, is needed to determine whether LAL activity testing should be a routine part of NAFLD clinics. In conclusion, through comprehensive analysis of genetic variation in LIPA we have expanded our recognition of disease-causing mutants to 120 variants.LAL-D is an ultra-rare disease, even in its late-onset form as CESD, and these data can help reassure clinicians that LAL-D is unlikely to represent a significant proportion of patients presenting with NAFLD.A consensus is needed for when testing LAL activity should be performed in patients with dyslipidaemia or hepatic steatosis.
Multiple organ failures (OFs) are common in patients with cirrhosis, but the independent effect of the number or type of OFs on liver transplantation (LT) outcomes is not well defined. United Network for Organ Sharing data were analyzed from 2002 to 2016 for all adults listed for LT who received an LT within 30 days after listing. We estimated post-LT survival stratified by number and type of pre-transplant OFs before and after adjusting for confounding variables. During the study period, 4,714 (4.1%) patients died and 19,375 (16.6%) patients were transplanted within 30 days of listing. One or more OF were more common in those who were transplanted (57.4%) compared to those without LT (9.5%). The probability of staying alive more than 30 days on the waiting list without LT decreased with increasing number of OFs; while 90% were alive without OF, only 20% were alive with two OFs, and 2–8% with three or more OFs. The interval between listing and transplantation decreased with an increase in OFs, and the median time to transplant after listing was only 4–5 days with three or more OFs. Although the risk of post-LT mortality increased with increasing number of OFs, the 90-day patient survival was 90% and one-year survival was 81% in the presence of 5–6 OFs. The number of OFs was an independent predictor of survival, but the maximum difference in one-year graft or patient survival between those without OF and those with 5–6 OFs was only 9%. Additionally, the type of OF had minimal impact on outcomes. Liver transplantation is feasible with excellent outcomes, even in the presence of five or six OFs. Patients with advanced liver disease may develop one or more organ failures (OFs) when acute decompensation occurs. Acute decompensation is often precipitated by hepatic or extra-hepatic insults such as infections, gastrointestinal bleeding, reactivation of viral hepatitis or alcohol abuse.1–7 Recently there has been a renewed interest in the impact of OFs on short-term mortality of patients with chronic liver diseases.1–4,8–10 It has been suggested that those who develop OF after acute decompensation may have a different pathophysiology and prognosis compared to those who decompensate without the development of OF. The term acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) has been used recently to describe this entity. Although studies from Asia, Europe and North America have used different definitions to describe OF, and hence ACLF, these studies have consistently shown that patients with multiple OF have poor short-term outcomes, irrespective of the precipitating cause of decompensation.1–4,11–13 These studies, based on relatively small sample sizes, also showed that mortality increased with increasing number of OFs, with 30-day mortality reaching well over 80% in those with 3–4 OFs. Patients with cirrhosis who experience an acute decompensating event and develop one or more OFs utilize enormous resources since they are managed in the intensive care units, often requiring dialysis and ventilatory support, while awaiting spontaneous recovery or liver transplantation (LT). There are, however, only limited data on the effectiveness or futility of LT in the setting of patients with multiple OF.11–21 In conclusion, we have shown that among patients who died within 30-days of listing for LT, the number of OFs was an important predictor of short-term survival with 92–98% of patients removed from the waiting list because of death or LT in the presence of three or more OFs.If these patients with three or more OFs received LT in a timely fashion, 80–85% survived one year and beyond.Based on these data, we believe that patients with cirrhosis and multiple OF should be given priority for expedited LT. Our observations also suggest that the effects of a recent decompensation could be ameliorated by LT and transplant futility may not apply to these patients.
Data regarding the nephrotoxicity of sofosbuvir (SOF) remain controversial. We compared the changes of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection receiving SOF-based or SOF-free direct acting antivirals (DAAs). 481 patients with compensated liver diseases and eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73m2 receiving SOF-based (n = 308) or SOF-free (n = 173) DAAs for 12 weeks were prospectively enrolled. The eGFR was assessed from baseline to off-therapy week 24 by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. The eGFR evolutions between regimens were compared by generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM). Multivariate analysis was performed for factors affecting eGFR evolution. Patients receiving SOF-based DAAs had a significant on-treatment eGFR decline (adjusted slope coefficient difference: -1.24 mL/min/1.73m2/month [95% CI: -1.35 to -1.13]; p < 0.001) and a significant off-therapy eGFR improvement (adjusted slope coefficient difference: 0.14 mL/min/1.73m2/month [95% CI: 0.08 to 0.21]; p = 0.004) than patients receiving SOF-free DAAs. Multivariate analysis showed age per 1-year increase (adjusted slope coefficient difference: -0.05 mL/min/1.73m2/month [95% CI: -0.05 to -0.04]; p < 0.001), SOF-based DAAs (adjusted slope coefficient difference: -0.33 mL/min/1.73m2/month [95% CI: -0.49 to -0.17]; p < 0.001), and CKD stage (adjusted slope coefficient difference: -1.44 mL/min/1.73m2/month [95% CI: -1.58 to -1.30] and -3.59 mL/min/1.73m2/month [95% CI: -3.88 to -3.30] for stage 3 and stage 2 vs. stage 1; p < 0.001) were independent factors affecting eGFR evolution from baseline to SVR24. Patients receiving SOF-based DAAs have a quadratic trend with on-treatment worsening and off-therapy improving eGFR. Increasing age, SOF-based DAAs, and more advanced CKD stages are independently associated with eGFR decline in HCV patients receiving DAAs. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major health problem which affects 71 million people worldwide.1 Patients with chronic HCV infection may present with various hepatic and extrahepatic manifestations that lead to substantial morbidity and mortality.2-5 In contrast, the long-term health outcome improves following successful HCV eradication by antiviral therapies.6-8 
Most cholesterol gallstones have a core consisting of inorganic and/or organic calcium salts, although the mechanisms of core formation are poorly understood. We examined whether the paracellular permeability of ions at hepatic tight junctions is involved in the core formation of cholesterol gallstones, with particular interest in the role of phosphate ion, a common food additive and preservative. We focused on claudin-3 (Cldn3), a paracellular barrier-forming tight junction protein whose expression in mouse liver decreases with age. Since Cldn3-knockout mice exhibited gallstone diseases, we used them to assess the causal relationship between paracellular phosphate ion permeability and the core formation of cholesterol gallstones. In the liver of Cldn3-knockout mice, the paracellular phosphate ion permeability through hepatic tight junctions was significantly increased, resulting in calcium phosphate core formation. Cholesterol overdose caused cholesterol gallstone disease in these mice. We revealed that in the hepatobiliary system, Cldn3 functions as a paracellular barrier for phosphate ions, to help maintain biliary ion homeostasis. We provide in vivo evidence that elevated phosphate ion concentrations play a major role in the lifestyle- and age-related risks of developing cholesterol gallstone disease under cholesterol overdose. Gallstone diseases have various symptoms, including pain and fever, and can lead to life-threatening conditions such as acute cholangitis, acute cholecystitis, biliary pancreatitis, and cancer of the biliary tract.1,2 Given that gallstone diseases have a high incidence rate, are costly to treat surgically, and are responsible for lost work hours due to symptoms, preventing these diseases should have deep impacts on health and society.1 
It remains controversial whether direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) accelerate the recurrence of hepatitis C-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative therapy. This study aimed to evaluate HCC recurrence after DAA treatment of chronic hepatitis C. We enrolled patients with a history of successful radiofrequency ablation treatment for hepatitis C-related HCC who received antiviral therapy with DAAs (DAA group: 147 patients) or with interferon (IFN)-based therapy (IFN group: 156 patients). We assessed HCC recurrence rates from the initiation of antiviral therapy using the Kaplan-Meier method and evaluated risk factors for HCC recurrence by multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. The recurrence pattern was categorized as follows: intrahepatic recurrence with a single tumor <2 cm (stage 0), a single tumor or up to 3 tumors ≤3 cm (stage A), multinodular (stage B), and extrahepatic metastasis or macrovascular invasion (stage C). The recurrence rates at 1 and 2 years were 39% and 61% in the IFN group and 39% and 60% in the DAA group, respectively (p = 0.43). Multivariate analysis identified higher lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of alpha-fetoprotein level, a history of multiple HCC treatments, and a shorter interval between HCC treatment and initiation of antiviral therapy as independent risk factors for HCC recurrence. HCC recurrence in stage 0, A, B, and C was found in 56 (41%), 60 (44%), 19 (14%), and 1 (0.7%) patients in the IFN group and 35 (44%), 32 (40%), 11 (14%), and 2 (2.5%) patients in the DAA group, respectively (p = 0.70). HCC recurrence rates and patterns after initiation of antiviral therapy did not differ between patients who received IFN-based therapy and DAA therapy. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and a leading cause of cancer-related death.1 HCC usually develops in patients with chronic liver diseases, often related to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.2,3 Although interferon (IFN)-based therapy after HCC treatment reportedly reduces the risk of HCC recurrence,4–6 few patients were eligible for IFN therapy after HCC treatment because of aging or advanced liver fibrosis, and its antiviral effect was inversely associated with the rates of adverse effects.7 Currently, with the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), patients with a history of HCC can achieve a high sustained virologic response (SVR) rate with favorable tolerability.8,9 In conclusion, we found no significant difference in the early HCC recurrence rate and pattern between patients who received IFN-based and DAA therapy after HCC treatment.Recurrence at an advanced stage was infrequent in both groups.A high AFP-L3 level, short recurrence-free period, and history of multiple HCC treatments were independent risk factors for early HCC recurrence after the initiation of antiviral therapy.
Treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) leads to hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA suppression in most patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), but HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) loss rates are low. Upon NA discontinuation, HBV DNA can return rapidly with ensuing alanine aminotransferase flares and induction of cytokines. Several studies reported higher HBsAg loss rates after stopping therapy, but at present it is unclear if cell-mediated immune responses are altered after treatment discontinuation. The aim of this study was to characterise T cell responses during the early phase of virological relapse, following discontinuation of NA therapy in HBeAg-negative patients. A total of 15 HBeAg-negative patients with CHB on long-term NA treatment were included in a prospective study and subjected to structured NA discontinuation. T cell responses were studied at the end of NA therapy and 4, 8 and 12 weeks thereafter. The T cell phenotype of patients with CHB on long-term NA therapy was markedly different compared to healthy individuals, but was only slightly altered after discontinuation of therapy. T cells from patients with HBsAg loss expressed low levels of KLRG1 and PD-1 at all time-points and high levels of Ki-67 and CD38 at week 12 after treatment cessation. In vitro peptide stimulated HBV-specific T cell responses were increased in several patients after NA cessation. Blocking of PD-L1 further enhanced HBV-specific T cell responses, especially after discontinuation of therapy. Relapse of active HBV replication after stopping therapy may trigger an immunological environment that enhances the responsiveness of HBV-specific T cells in vitro. Together with other immune interventions, this approach might be of interest for the development of novel therapeutic options to induce HBsAg loss in CHB. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) chronically infects around 250 million individuals worldwide and can cause liver cirrhosis as well as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).1 The treatment options for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are either pegylated interferon-alfa (PEG-IFNα) or nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA). PEG-IFNα has the advantage of finite treatment with higher rates of anti-HBs seroconversion of around 10%, but is associated with considerable side effects.2 Thus, well-tolerated NAs are most commonly used. NAs efficiently suppress viral replication in most patients, have a beneficial effect on disease progression, and reduce the risk of HCC development.2 Still, NAs only have minor, if any, effect on covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). For this reason, functional cure is a rare event and most patients with CHB require life-long therapy, particularly HBV e antigen (HBeAg)-negative patients.2 In conclusion, we report that structured discontinuation of NA therapy in HBeAg-negative patients with CHB leads to minor alterations in T cell phenotype and a higher responsiveness to in vitro peptide stimulation with HBV core-specific overlapping peptides in several patients.We hypothesise that relapse of HBV replication could change the cytokine milieu and lead to an increased responsiveness of HBV-specific T cells, which might be interesting for new therapeutic approaches to induce HBsAg decline or loss.Thus, discontinuation of therapy could be a favourable option for selected patients and may be combined with novel treatment options.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes chronic liver disease. Antivirals have been developed and cure infection. However, resistance can emerge and salvage therapies with alternative modes of action could be useful. Several licensed drugs have emerged as HCV entry inhibitors and are thus candidates for drug repurposing. We aimed to dissect their mode of action, identify improved derivatives and determine their viral targets. HCV entry inhibition was tested for a panel of structurally related compounds, using chimeric viruses representing diverse genotypes, in addition to viruses containing previously determined resistance mutations. Chemical modeling and synthesis identified improved derivatives, while generation of susceptible and non-susceptible chimeric viruses pinpointed E1 determinants of compound sensitivity. Molecules of the diphenylpiperazine, diphenylpiperidine, phenothiazine, thioxanthene, and cycloheptenepiperidine chemotypes inhibit HCV infection by interfering with membrane fusion. These molecules and a novel p-methoxy-flunarizine derivative with improved efficacy preferentially inhibit genotype 2 viral strains. Viral residues within a central hydrophobic region of E1 (residues 290–312) control susceptibility. At the same time, viral features in this region also govern pH-dependence of viral membrane fusion. Small molecules from different chemotypes related to flunarizine preferentially inhibit HCV genotype 2 membrane fusion. A hydrophobic region proximal to the putative fusion loop controls sensitivity to these drugs and the pH range of membrane fusion. An algorithm considering viral features in this region predicts viral sensitivity to membrane fusion inhibitors. Resistance to flunarizine correlates with more relaxed pH requirements for fusion. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a highly variable, enveloped virus of the family Flaviviridae. According to sequence analyses, viral isolates are classified into 7 genotypes and 86 subtypes.1 HCV particles harbor a plus-strand RNA genome of positive polarity that encodes a polyprotein comprising structural proteins, the p7 ion channel and various non-structural proteins. Virus particles are composed of the core protein that encases the viral RNA, and of the envelope 1 and envelope 2 (E1-E2) glycoproteins, which are embedded in the viral lipid membrane. Virion-associated E1-E2 glycoproteins coordinate interactions with cellular receptors, cell uptake and membrane fusion which is triggered by the low pH in cellular endosomes. 
Since iPSC human develop into hepatic organoids through stages that resemble human embryonic liver development, they can be used to study developmental processes and disease pathology. Therefore, we examined the early stages of hepatic organoid formation to identify key pathways affecting early liver development. Single cell RNA-sequencing and metabolomic analysis was performed on developing organoid cultures at the iPSC, hepatoblast (day 9) and mature organoid stage. The importance of the phosphatidyl-ethanolamine biosynthesis pathway to early liver development was examined in developing organoid cultures using iPSC with a CRISPR-mediated gene knockout and an over the counter medication (meclizine) that inhibits the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway. Meclizine’s effect on the growth of a human hepatocarcinoma cell line in a xenotransplantation model and on the growth of acute myeloid leukemia cells in vitro was also examined. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis of organoid development indicated that the phosphatidyl-ethanolamine biosynthesis pathway is essential for early liver development. Unexpectedly, early hepatoblasts were selectively sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of meclizine. We demonstrate that meclizine could be repurposed for use in a new synergistic combination therapy for primary liver cancer: a glycolysis inhibitor reprograms cancer cell metabolism to make it susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of meclizine. This combination inhibited the growth of a human liver carcinoma cell line in vitro; and in a xenotransplantation model without causing significant side effets. This drug combination was also highly active against acute myeloid leukemic cells. Our data indicates that the phosphatidyl-ethanolamine biosynthesis is a targetable pathway for cancer; and that meclizine may have clinical efficacy as a repurposed anti-cancer drug when used as part of a new combination therapy. Organoids have provided a very powerful model system for analyzing organogenesis and disease pathophysiology (1, 2). We recently developed a novel method to direct the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into 3-dimensional human hepatic organoids (HOs), which consist of sheets of hepatocytes, and cholangiocytes that are organized into epithelia that surround the lumina of duct-like structures. The HOs have biosynthetic, and functional capabilities of human liver; and HOs with engineered mutations provide a unique model for studying human disease-causing genetic mutations (3). In response to changes in the growth factors added to the media, HOs develop through stages that resemble human liver during embryonic development. Because of these properties, HOs could be used to identify pathways regulating discrete stages in liver development and disease pathogenesis. 
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an effective treatment for single hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ≤3 cm. Disease recurrence is common, and in some patients will occur outside transplant criteria. We aimed to assess the incidence and risk factors for recurrence beyond Milan criteria in potentially transplantable patients treated with RFA as first-line therapy. We performed a retrospective cohort study of potentially transplantable patients with new diagnoses of unifocal HCC ≤3 cm that underwent RFA as first-line therapy between 2000-2015. We defined potentially transplantable patients as those aged <70 years without any comorbidities that would preclude transplant surgery. Incidence of recurrence beyond Milan criteria was compared across 2 groups according to HCC diameter at the time of ablation: (HCC ≤2 cm vs. HCC >2 cm). Competing risks Cox regression was used to identify predictors of recurrence beyond Milan criteria. We included 301 patients (167 HCC ≤2 cm and 134 HCC >2 cm). Recurrence beyond Milan criteria occurred in 36 (21.6%) and 47 (35.1%) patients in the HCC ≤2 cm and the HCC >2 cm groups, respectively (p = 0.01). The 1-, 3- and 5-year actuarial survival rates after RFA were 98.2%, 86.2% and 79.0% in the HCC ≤2 cm group vs. 93.3%, 77.6% and 70.9% in the HCC >2 cm group (p = 0.01). Tumor size >2 cm (hazard ratio 1.94; 95% CI 1.25–3.02) and alpha-fetoprotein levels at the time of ablation (100–1,000 ng/ml: hazard ratio 2.05; 95% CI 1.10–3.83) were found to be predictors of post-RFA recurrence outside Milan criteria. RFA for single HCC ≤3 cm provides excellent short- to medium-term survival. However, we identified patients at higher risk of recurrence beyond Milan criteria. For these patients, liver transplantation should be considered immediately after the first HCC recurrence following RFA. The optimal approach for transplantable patients with early unifocal HCC is unclear. Small HCC (BCLC-0 or A) can be treated with ablation, liver resection, or liver transplantation (LT) as first-line therapies.1 Although the results of LT are excellent, most jurisdictions currently only assign model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) exception points to patients with larger HCC based on the belief that if resection or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) do not work, transplantation can be undertaken as a second curative procedure.2 
Patients with decompensated cirrhosis on the waiting list for liver transplantation (LT) commonly develop complications that may preclude them from reaching LT. Circulatory dysfunction leading to effective arterial hypovolemia and activation of vasoconstrictor systems is a key factor in the pathophysiology of complications of cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether treatment with midodrine, an alpha-adrenergic vasoconstrictor, together with intravenous albumin improves circulatory dysfunction and prevents complications of cirrhosis in patients awaiting LT. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT00839358) was conducted, including 196 consecutive patients with cirrhosis and ascites awaiting LT. Patients were randomly assigned to receive midodrine (15–30 mg/day) and albumin (40 g/15 days) or matching placebos for one year, until LT or drop-off from inclusion on the waiting list. The primary endpoint was incidence of any complication (renal failure, hyponatremia, infections, hepatic encephalopathy or gastrointestinal bleeding). Secondary endpoints were mortality, activity of endogenous vasoconstrictor systems and plasma cytokine levels. There were no significant differences between both groups in the probability of developing complications of cirrhosis during follow-up (p = 0.402) or one-year mortality (p = 0.527). Treatment with midodrine and albumin was associated with a slight but significant decrease in plasma renin activity and aldosterone compared to placebo (renin −4.3 vs. 0.1 ng/ml.h, p < 0.001; aldosterone −38 vs. 6 ng/dl, p = 0.02, at week 48 vs. baseline). Plasma norepinephrine only decreased slightly at week 4. Neither arterial pressure nor plasma cytokine levels changed significantly. In patients with cirrhosis awaiting LT, treatment with midodrine and albumin, at the doses used in this study, slightly suppressed the activity of vasoconstrictor systems, but did not prevent complications of cirrhosis or improve survival. The natural history of decompensated cirrhosis is characterized by the development of recurrent complications of the disease, leading to frequent hospital admissions, impaired quality of life and increased mortality.1–5 Liver transplantation (LT) is the definitive treatment for patients with end-stage liver disease. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis achieve good outcomes after LT with three-year survival above 80%.5–8 However, one of the major concerns is the development of complications while on the waiting list, which may be a cause of death or may delay or preclude patients with decompensated cirrhosis from receiving LT.9–12 In conclusion, the results of the present study show that treatment with oral midodrine and i.v. albumin, at the doses and duration given in this therapeutic trial, in patients with decompensated cirrhosis on the waiting list for LT was neither associated with a decrease in the incidence of complications of cirrhosis nor with an improvement in survival.
Acetaminophen (APAP) induced hepatotoxicity is a leading cause of acute liver failure worldwide. It is well established that the liver damage induced by acetaminophen exhibits diurnal variation. However, the detailed mechanism for the hepatotoxic variation is not clear. Herein, we aimed to determine the relative contributions of gut microbiota in modulating the diurnal variation of hepatotoxicity induced by APAP. Male Balb/C mice were treated with or without antibiotics and a single dose of orally administered APAP (300 mg/kg) at ZT0 (when the light is on-start of resting period) and ZT12 (when the light is off-start of active period). In agreement with previous findings, hepatic injury was markedly enhanced at ZT12 compared with ZT0. Interestingly, upon antibiotic treatment, ZT12 displayed a protective effect against APAP hepatotoxicity similar to ZT0. Moreover, mice that received the cecal content from ZT12 showed more severe liver damage than mice that received the cecal content from ZT0. 16S sequencing data revealed significant differences in the cecal content between ZT0 and ZT12 in the compositional level. Furthermore, metabolomic analysis showed that the gut microbial metabolites were also different between ZT0 and ZT12. Specifically, the level of 1-phenyl-1,2-propanedione (PPD) was significantly higher at ZT12 than ZT0. Treatment with PPD alone did not cause obvious liver damage. However, PPD synergistically enhanced APAP-induced hepatic injury in vivo and in vitro. Finally, we found Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which could reduce intestinal PPD levels, was able to markedly alleviate APAP-induced liver damage at ZT12. The gut microbial metabolite PPD was responsible, at least in part, for the diurnal variation of hepatotoxicity induced by APAP by decreasing glutathione levels. Acetaminophen (APAP) is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic drug.1,2 However, severe hepatotoxicity resulting from excessive doses is the leading cause for acute liver failure (ALF) in the Western world.3,4 APAP is absorbed from the intestine and processed by liver.5 When taken at a low dose, APAP is mainly eliminated by sulfation and glucuronidation, with the toxicity pathway making only a small contribution and mainly detoxified by glutathione (GSH).6–8 With elevation of APAP concentration in hepatocytes, a greater portion of APAP can be metabolized into N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) by cytochrome P450s, mainly by CYP2E1.9,10 NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with hepatic GSH. However, if GSH is exhausted, the generated reactive metabolite accumulates and exerts toxic effects initiated by covalent binding to macromolecules. This causes mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately leading to hepatocyte necrosis and ALF.11–13 In conclusion, we provide a novel mechanism for the diurnal variation of APAP-induced acute liver damage mediated by gut microbial functional oscillations.
